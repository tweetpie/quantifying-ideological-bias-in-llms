      "text": "'Not going to cooperate': Border state sheriffs vow to defy Trump's mass deportations plan\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's advisors have been hoping county sheriffs in border states will assist with the incoming administration's mass deportation campaign. But several sheriffs are already publicly promising to not lift a finger.\n\nAccording to a Tuesday report in WIRED magazine , Trump's top Trump immigration advisors like Tom Homan and Stephen Miller have been having conversations with several far-right sheriffs who have expressed an interest in helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) remove immigrants from the United States. But that effort is unlikely to pick up traction, both for legal reasons and because other sheriffs have said they already have their hands full and don't want to take on more work.\n\nCurrently, ICE's 287(g) program allows for state and local law enforcement to collaborate with ICE in its efforts \"to protect the homeland through the arrest and removal of noncitizens.\" However, this does not include sheriffs themselves rounding up and detaining undocumented immigrants. Additionally, no federal funding has been appropriated to any sheriffs' offices that help ICE, meaning just 125 out of 3,081 sheriff's offices in the U.S. have signed up. And Yuma County, Arizona Sheriff Leon Wilmot told WIRED that the Supreme Court has already established that enforcing immigration law is outside the jurisdiction of local police departments and sheriffs' offices.\n\n\"[T]hat's not our realm of responsibility,\" Wilmot said. \"If we wanted to do immigration law, we would go work for Border Patrol.\"\n\nThe push for sheriffs to assist the incoming administration has been led by retired sheriff Tom Mack, who is the head of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA). Mack told WIRED he's been exchanging voice and text messages with Homan about getting more sheriffs involved with deportations. Homan has previously promised to build \"the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen.\" But Wilmot said \"no one listens to\" Mack, that he \"hasn't been a sheriff in a long time\" and that he \"pushes his own agenda.\"\n\nSanta Cruz County Sheriff David Hathaway, who is a Democrat, told WIRED that he wasn't invited to an event Homan hosted in his state last month, even though Hathaway's jurisdiction includes some of the nation's biggest ports of entry. He added that he would refuse any calls to help the Trump administration deport immigrants, as it would hurt his standing in his county.\n\n\"I'm not going to cooperate, because 95 percent of the residents of the town where I live, where my county is, are Hispanic,\" Hathaway said. \"I'm not going to go checking the documents of practically every single person in my county to determine their immigration status, because that would create distrust between law enforcement and all the people in my community.\"\n\nThe sheriffs bucking calls to assist with mass deportations even include some of Trump's biggest supporters in the law enforcement community. Livingston County, Michigan Sheriff Mike Murphy - who hosted a pro-Trump rally in a building owned by the sheriff's office - told the outlet that he isn't interested in using county resources to help with federal immigration law enforcement.\n\n\"I still have a county to do police work in,\" Murphy said. \"Just because the president says, 'Hey, go out and round them up,' that is not all of a sudden gonna move to the top of my priority list. If somebody's house is getting broken into, that's my priority. If somebody's involved in an injury crash and they're laying on the side of the road, that's my priority. I've got cases that are open.\"\n\nOther border state sheriffs who have come out against calls to help the Trump administration round up migrants include Val Verde County, Texas Sheriff Joe Frank Martinez and Brewster County, Texas Sheriff Ronny Dodson. According to Dodson, the incoming Trump administration giving sheriffs the authority to jail migrants could \"break\" county law enforcement.\n\n\"I'm not gonna let the government tell me what to do in my job,\" Dodson said."

      "text": "How sheriffs define law and order depends a lot on their views - and most are Republican men\n\nRiverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, Wikimedia Commons\n\nMany Americans will find on their November 2024 ballot a space to vote for an important office: local sheriff. While there are exceptions, sheriffs have a long history of using their power to maintain a particular, unequal balance of power in society, often along racial and class lines.\n\nA recent example of this arose on Sept. 13, 2024, when Bruce Zuchowski, sheriff of Portage County, Ohio, posted a message on a Facebook page headed by a graphic that included his official portrait and which was labeled with his official title . Zuchowski called for the public to write down the addresses of people who have campaign signs supporting Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in their yards.\n\nThat way, he said, when immigrants arrive and need housing, \"We'll already have the addresses of the ... families ... who supported their arrival.\"\n\nThe post, which Zuchowski later claimed appeared on his \"personal Facebook page,\" used derogatory terms for immigrants and for Harris. It also included screenshots of two Fox News stories about migrants in Aurora, Colorado, and Springfield, Ohio, which are both places that former President Donald Trump , the Republican nominee, and his running mate JD Vance have falsely claimed to be sites of dangerous activity by immigrants.\n\nSheriffs in the U.S. don't often get national news attention, but Zuchowski's request was covered in The Washington Post , NBC News and The Guardian , among others.\n\nThere are more than 3,000 sheriffs elected at the county level in the United States, each of whom has authority and autonomy to both set and enforce law enforcement policy. For example, sheriffs in many states can decide whether their deputies will wear body cameras and what happens to the footage recorded during routine stops.\n\nIn our book, \" The Power of the Badge: Sheriffs and Inequality in the United States ,\" we provide a comprehensive look at this office and detail the history of sheriffs enforcing inequality both by using formal powers of their office, such as cooperating with federal immigration officers , and with informal powers, such as communicating about who belongs in their community.\n\nZuchowski's post, which vilifies immigrants and targets people who support immigrant rights, is just part of that long history of sheriffs using their power as a tool of social control, as we document in our book.\n\nVarious sheriffs have participated in social control throughout American history. For instance, in the 18th century, an Alabama sheriff ran slave auctions and Georgia sheriffs played a central role in enforcing slave codes . In the 19th century, a Pennsylvania sheriff quashed union efforts to protect workers' rights against exploitative businesses. In the 20th century, Southern sheriffs' roles in voter suppression during the Civil Rights Movement are well documented. In the 21st century, racial profiling has been a problem in the enforcement of traffic laws by sheriffs in Arizona and California, among other states. Zuchowski is just one 21st-century sheriff entering the debate over immigration policy and immigrants' rights .\n\nIn the wake of Zuchowski's post, The Portager, a news website in his community, reported residents saying the sheriff's post constituted voter intimidation . Some residents have called for investigations of the sheriff's office by local, state and national agencies, including the Department of Justice's civil rights division.\n\nSo far, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office says the sheriff has broken no laws .\n\nIn both our book and previous work , we document through two national surveys how variations in sheriffs' views on race and ethnicity may shape their office's policies and practices.\n\nZuchowski's comments about immigrants, including calling them \"Illegal human 'Locust,'\" denies their humanity by comparing immigrants to animals .\n\nIn our research, we have found that sheriffs' negative attitudes toward immigrants are statistically correlated to their offices' anti-immigrant policies . For instance, sheriffs with more negative attitudes are more likely to have an official policy to check the immigration status of crime victims and witnesses. That relationship held even after we controlled potential influence of other factors such as political partisanship and the share of the native-born population in a sheriff's county.\n\nSimilarly, as we show in our book, sheriffs with racist views were less likely to report to us their deputies have been trained to reduce racial and ethnic bias in traffic enforcement. That issue is a problem in Portage County, according to the local NAACP, which in 2023 released a report claiming the sheriff's office unfairly targets Black drivers .\n\nSince his initial post, Zuchowski has defended himself on social media, writing:\n\nDespite Zuchowski's claims, he is indeed a politician. Like other sheriffs in the United States, he was elected by voters. He was the Republican nominee in 2020 and is running for reelection in 2024.\n\nLike sheriffs across the country, Zuchowski had extensive law enforcement experience, including working in the Portage County Sheriff's Office prior to running to head the office. We found that more than 85% of sheriffs worked for the previous sheriff before seeking election. And like most other sheriffs, Zuchowski is a white Republican man . We and others find that more than 90% of sheriffs are white and over 98% are men.\n\nAcross the United States, sheriffs will ask voters for their support this fall to remain in office. In most counties, these elections are uncompetitive: Sheriffs usually run either unopposed or against weak candidates.\n\nIn this way, Portage County is an exception. Zuchowski's first election was a competitive race for an open seat , and he faces a challenger to his reelection bid in the 2024 election. His Democratic opponent, Jon Barber, is similarly a white man with a law enforcement background.\n\nBut Barber's campaign website highlights another common challenge for voters: how to pick a good sheriff. His site focuses on transparency, accountability and community policing, with no discussion of immigration. Voters don't get a clear message about any substantive differences that might exist between the two candidates.\n\nWill Zuchowski's comments matter for voters? Elsewhere around the country, voters have reelected sheriffs who have made anti-immigrant and racist comments.\n\nMirya Holman , Associate Professor of Public Policy, University of Houston and Emily Farris , Associate Professor of Political Science, Texas Christian University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

And on Monday night, January 20 - after returning to the White House - President Trump issued an executive order against birthright citizenship , underscoring his deportations promise.\n\nMany legal experts, however, are saying that carrying out the amount of mass deportations Trump has promised is much easier said than done.\n\nCalMatters conducted a comprehensive survey of sheriffs in California, asking all 58 sheriffs in the state about immigration enforcement under Trump's second presidency.\n\nAccording to reporters Tomas Apodaca and Nigel Duara , Trump's promises \"could put California's 58 elected sheriffs in the hot seat because of their responsibility to manage local jails.\"\n\nSheriffs in Los Angeles, Napa, Orange, Madera, San Bernadino and Mendocino Counties told CalMatters they will \"comply with state law,\" while Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said he will \"cooperate with ICE.\" And the sheriffs of Kern and Butte Counties responded, \"Unclear.\"\n\n\"CalMatters reached out to the sheriffs by e-mail and website contact forms,\" Apodaca and Nigel Duara explain . \"When those weren't available, we called the contact number on their website. Two county sheriffs' offices - Monterey and San Mateo - did not return calls seeking comment.\"\n\nThe CalMatters reporters add , \"For months, Trump allies have signaled that they'd focus initial immigration enforcement on undocumented people who have committed crimes. This month, the House of Representatives passed a bill that would empower immigration agencies to deport people arrested on suspicion of burglary, theft and shoplifting. The bill is expected to pass the Senate.\"\n\nRead the full CalMatters report at this link ."

      "text": "'Worst policies of Trump extremists': Swing state GOP wants to cut aid to 'noncooperative' sheriffs\n\nSen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) says that legislation requiring sheriffs to cooperate with ICE is meant to \"keep communities safe\" and that the message to sheriffs is \"do not put your personal politics above the safety of the citizens who elected you.\"\n\nRepublican state lawmakers said Tuesday they would introduce a bill to force local law enforcement to verify the citizenship status of people in custody for a felony offense and to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) if citizenship cannot be verified. Counties that do not comply would be at risk of losing state money.\n\nLawmakers said that Wisconsin needs to assist President Donald Trump and the federal government with its work deporting \"illegal immigrants\" from the United States. Since inauguration day, federal agents have arrested more than 8,000 people , including some people who had no criminal history.\n\nState Sen. Julian Bradley (R-New Berlin) said at a press conference that the legislation is meant to \"keep communities safe\" and that the message to sheriffs is \"do not put your personal politics above the safety of the citizens who elected you.\"\n\nUnder the bill, noncompliance by a sheriff would result in a 15% reduction in the county's shared revenue payments from the state in the next year. Counties across Wisconsin rely on those payments to fund public safety, emergency medical services, transportation and other services. Sheriffs would have to certify compliance each year with the Wisconsin Department of Revenue.\n\nThe bill would also require sheriffs to comply with detainers and administrative warrants received from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for individuals held in the county jail for a criminal offense. Sheriffs would also need to seek reimbursement from the federal government for any costs incurred while holding people.\n\n\"We don't want Wisconsin on the hook for this,\" Bradley said.\n\n- Milwaukee County Supervisors\n\nThe bill would also require sheriffs to keep a record of people who were verified as unlawfully residing in the U.S. and submit the information to the Legislature in a biannual report.\n\nLawmakers said that sheriffs would continue to have discretion over whether to report people who aren't detained for a felony offense.\n\nBradley said that only \"far left extremists in this country believe that someone here illegally that commits a felony should be allowed to stay.\" He noted that the Laken Riley Act , which expands the mandatory detention requirements of immigrants charged and arrested on petty and other crimes, passed Congress with the help of 46 House and 12 Senate Democrats. He said the issue should be one with bipartisan support and called on his Democratic colleagues to sign on.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported the legislation after obtaining a copy of the draft bill.\n\nSimilar legislation was enacted in North Carolina last year.\n\nGov. Tony Evers has already committed to vetoing the legislation should it make it to his desk.\n\nIn a statement released to the Journal Sentinel , Evers' spokesperson Britt Cudaback called the bill an \"unserious proposal\" that is \"trying to micromanage local law enforcement decisions by threatening to gut state aid by 15% for our local communities - that's a non-starter.\"\n\n\"We shouldn't be threatening law enforcement with deep budget cuts, we should be working together with local law enforcement to improve public safety, reduce crime, and keep dangerous drugs and violent criminals off of our streets,\" Cudaback said.\n\nAssembly Majority Leaders Tyler August (R-Walworth) said it's \"unbelievable\" Evers would threaten a veto of the legislation.\n\n\"It's unbelievably unfortunate, but not unexpected that the governor would threaten to veto a bill that he hasn't even seen yet,\" August said. \"[It] seems to be his M.O. that he governs by veto.\"\n\nCurrently, seven Wisconsin counties have agreements with ICE to hold in jail immigrants without legal status to reside in the U.S. At one point, that number was eight, but Lafayette County ended its participation in ICE's 287(g) program.\n\nAugust said lawmakers talked with county officials, including those in Waukesha, while drafting the bill.\n\n\"A lot of the sheriffs already do this by practice because they know that it's what's right for their communities,\" August said.\n\nIn a cosponsorship memo, lawmakers point to a June 2024 ICE report that lists Dane and Milwaukee counties as \"noncooperative institutions.\"\n\nDane County until recently participated in the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), in which it provided the names of immigrants lacking legal status to the federal government and in return were reimbursed for the costs of their incarceration.\n\nDane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett recently ended the county's participation in the program . He told Channel 3000 that it's a \"different time\" and that the \"the previous administration is completely different than our current administration, and we have to be able to continue to represent the values of our community.\"\n\nMilwaukee County Supervisors Caroline Gómez-Tom, Juan Miguel Martínez, Anne O'Connor, Steven Shea, Sky Z. Capriolo and Justin Bielinski denounced the legislation in a statement, calling it a \"dangerous\" proposal that would make sheriffs \"a tool of the Trump administration's bigoted obsession with scapegoating immigrants.\"\n\nThe supervisors said that mandating that sheriffs honor 'administrative warrants' not approved by a judge would \"bog down law enforcement with false alarms - preventing them from focusing on real public safety concerns like reckless driving, drug overdoses, and rising crime.\"\n\nThey also warned that the bill could force Wisconsin residents to carry documents at all times to prove they have \"the right to live in their homes, go to work and pick their children up from school,\" and that \"anyone detained by a Wisconsin sheriff who cannot immediately prove their legal status would be at risk of being handed over to federal authorities.\"\n\nA 2024 survey conducted by the Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement at the University of Maryland in conjunction with the Brennan Center for Justice found that more than 9% of American citizens of voting age don't have documents - including a passport, birth certificate, or naturalization papers - to serve as proof of citizenship readily available. The survey found that the lack of documentation could be for various reasons including documents being in the home of another family member or in a safety deposit box or that the documents have been lost, destroyed or stolen.\n\n\"The only thing this proposal accomplishes is to bankrupt Wisconsin law enforcement both morally and fiscally,\" the supervisors said, adding that they encourage the Milwaukee County Sheriff's office to \"remain focused on actual public safety instead of enabling the worst policies of Trump extremists.\"\n\nACLU of Wisconsin condemned the legislation, saying it \"sends the wrong message.\" The group noted that it could mean that any one who invokes their Fifth Amendment right to remain silent would have to be reported to ICE along with anyone who cooperates but fails to have access to the specific documents listed in the bill.\n\n\"It sends the message that local law enforcement should take on the additional tasks and risks of immigration status investigations,\" Executive Director Melinda Brennan said in a statement. \"It will encourage xenophobic sheriffs to investigate the status of not just persons accused of serious crimes but of anyone who enters their custody.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers accused Democrats of being extremist. Democratic lawmakers announced a proposal last week that would block state and local government officials from cooperating with federal deportation efforts without a judicial warrant. It would apply to detentions in a public building or facility, school, place of worship, place where child care services are provided, or place where medical or other health care services are provided.\n\nAugust said Democrats' proposal \"basically would turn the entire state into a sanctuary state.\"\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nWisconsin Examiner is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "'Never saw this day coming to America': MAGA think tank's secret 'Sheriff Fellowship' curriculum unveiled\n\nA Trump-inspired think tank has reportedly unveiled its secret \"Sheriff Fellowship\" revealing the far-right's level of investment in law enforcement.\n\nAccording to Slate magazine's assessment, the Claremont Institute's curriculum \"reveals a program that presented for the sheriffs two sets of people in America: those communities sheriffs should police as freely and brutally as they see fit, and those \"real\" Americans who should be considered virtually above the law.\"\n\n\"Public information requests and other reporting have provided insight into the stated and unstated reasons behind the Claremont Institute's recruitment of county sheriffs, and revealed the curriculum of the fellowship,\" Slate's Jessica Pishko wrote.\n\nPishko's report also offers a brief breakdown of the curriculum.\n\n\"The first day was focused on policing and heavily featured the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald , a lawyer who has written dozens of articles arguing that law enforcement in America does not have an implicit or explicit racism problem,\" she wrote. \"The supplemental readings for this section included articles and books by Mac Donald with titles like War on Cops , The Diversity Delusion , 'The Myth of Systemic Police Racism,' and \"Black Lies Matter.\"\n\nShe also added, \"Day Two involved a series of history lessons, including New York Times Magazine's editor-in-chief Jake Silverstein's essay about the 1619 Project, of which Claremont Institute scholars have been deeply critical. (Nikole Hannah-Jones' essay \"America Wasn't a Democracy, Until Black Americans Made It One\" was assigned as a supplemental reading.)\"\n\nAccording to Pishko, days three and four focused on a broader spectrum that detailed dealing with \"one's enemy.\" \"Day Three was focused on heady philosophical pursuits, while Day Four broadened the discussion to include various progressive movements and projects, largely, it seems, from the angle of learning about one's enemy-or 'countering the perversion of the justice system by which the revolutionary Left seeks to advance its totalitarian agenda,' in Claremont-speak,\" she wrote.\n\nPishko also noted the perspective of the far-right and how the curriculum could influence the latest regime of law enforcement officers.\n\n\"The intellectual far right also clearly sees the utility of an army of sheriffs who are able to put these ideals into practice. Prior to the last presidential election, the Claremont Institute's 79 Days Report outlined how Donald Trump could take over the federal government by force, specifically naming county sheriffs as important to recruiting militia members and civilian posses to prevent 'hostile crowds of outsiders' from protesting a MAGA takeover.\"\n\nThe curriculum also appears to have the approval of sheriffs. Offering his take on the fellowship, Sheriff Kim Cole of Mason County, Michigan, wrote: \"I never saw this day coming to America. A time when Sheriffs are placed in a position to stand in the gap between citizens' rights and a government that seems to reach further and further over that line. Sheriffs must have a knowledge of where that line is and how to address the overreach with confidence.\""

They'll be led by Sheriff Richard Mack, a former Arizona sheriff who is also a founder of an extremist group that played a role in the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nMack gained notoriety after he was part of a lawsuit that successfully overturned a provision of the Brady Law in the 1990s.\n\nSince then, Mack founded the constitutional sheriffs group and has traveled the country, recruiting law enforcement officers - particularly sheriffs and deputies - to join his movement. Their central tenet, according to a report from the Anti-Defamation League, is that the county sheriff is the ultimate legal authority and can refuse to enforce any law they consider unconstitutional. This idea has no basis in law and aligns with so-called sovereign citizens , an anti-government extremist movement that believes they are sovereign from the U.S.\n\nMack will speak in Le Center, Freeport, Brownton, Champlin, Princeton, Deerwood, Rochester, La Crescent and Blaine, as first reported by the Minnesota news and opinion outlet Bluestem Prairie. Mack did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Blaine event is sponsored by the local Republican Party outfit representing outer-ring suburbs northwest of the Twin Cities.\n\nThe event in Champlin is being hosted by the Liberty Tea Party Patriots , which hosted an event in 2022 featuring Marty Probst, the husband of the GOP candidate for secretary of state. Probst called on Kim Crockett's supporters to urge law enforcement to intervene on Election Day, even though the law generally forbids it.\n\n\"If you've got friends or family or whatever in sheriff's deputies or sheriffs - we need them on Election Day,\" Probst said. \"That's part of the SWAT team to get out when certain places don't follow the rules that they're supposed to.\"\n\nMinnesota law bans police officers from being within 50 feet of polling places except to vote or if they're summoned by an election judge.\n\nMendota Heights Police Chief Kelly McCarthy, former chair of the state police licensing board, received an email inviting her to attend one of Mack's events from a group called Sterling and Time Defense , which trains people on firearms and use-of-force laws and advertises itself as certified by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and Department of Public Safety.\n\n\"I have no idea who any of these nut jobs are, other than they don't understand why we have three branches of government,\" McCarthy said.\n\nJames Stuart, executive director of the Minnesota Sheriffs' Association, said his organization sometimes gets questions from members about Mack's events, but doesn't tell sheriffs whether to participate or not.\n\n\"Sheriffs are gonna do what they know is best for their community,\" he said. \"I don't think there's a lot of participation for a variety of reasons.\"\n\nWhen Stuart was Anoka County sheriff, residents would sometimes encourage him to attend the events or send him Mack's books - one of which he said he's read. Stuart wouldn't give his personal opinion on the constitutional sheriff movement or say whether he's ever attended one of the events, but said, \"It's good to be informed\" and \"do your homework.\"\n\nMack was a founder of the Oath Keepers , a violent extremist group that played a key role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The ADL said six law enforcement officials from Minnesota were listed among members of the Oath Keepers last year. The ADL declined to disclose their names to the Reformer .\n\nThe Oath Keepers recruit law enforcement and have gotten more media attention, but the constitutional sheriffs group has \"arguably had more success infiltrating law enforcement,\" according to the ADL.\n\nMack's group believes county sheriffs' powers exceed those of any other authorities when they're protecting Americans from foreign or domestic enemies. Mack has claimed sheriffs have the power to call out the militia to support them - the same logic employed by the Posse Comitatus, which the ADL calls a loosely organized, far-right, violent anti-government group that sprang out of the West Coast around 1970, peaked in the early 1980s and evolved into the sovereign citizen movement.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus also believed county government reigned supreme and sheriffs could nullify laws. One of their members, Gordon Kahl, was involved in two fatal shootouts with law enforcement in 1983, one in North Dakota and later in Arkansas, where he was killed.\n\nMack refers to his supporters as his posse.\n\nThe constitutional sheriffs' group has honored as a \"sheriff of the year\" Wisconsin sheriff David Clarke, Jr., who described Black Lives Matter as a hate group and claimed they would join with the terrorist group ISIS to destroy American society.\n\nMinnesota Reformer is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Or, if you like, secession-by-sheriff.\"\n\nWhile the Sheriff's Fellowship is a new initiative for Claremont, the publication notes that other similar organizations like the Constitutional Sheriffs have existed for quite some time.\n\n\"Although the Oath Keepers, another anti-government extremist group that recruits from law enforcement, have garnered more media attention in recent years,\" the Anti-Defamation League said in their report , the Constitutional Sheriff movement \"has arguably had more success infiltrating law enforcement, including at the executive level.\"\n\nTrump, members of his administration, and well-known law enforcement officials have echoed the values and beliefs highlighted by the Claremont Institute.

In the days leading up to the January 6 insurrection, Clarke even urged Capitol rioters not to comply with law enforcement.\n\n\"ALERT!!!,\" Clarke wrote on Facebook at the time. \"If you attended the Trump rally in Washington DC last Wednesday and are contacted by the FBI or they come to your home, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TALK TO THEM. DON'T LET THEM IN YOUR HOME EITHER.

He cannot keep his department adequately staffed because his deputies are \"tired of working like Hebrew slaves for very little money,\" Williams told a local news source.\n\nIn Vegas, he told the audience that he wanted to protect America from \"globalists that are coming to destroy our nation,\" saying \"the moment we start acting like we are Americans, we are going to take our country back.\"\n\nFirst elected in 2016, Williams is part of the growing \"constitutional sheriff\" movement, which claims that sheriffs have the power to override federal and state authority on matters from border enforcement to gun control to election security.\n\nLegal scholars say the movement has no grounding in law, yet it is gaining steam: A study last year by scholars at Texas Christian University and Tulane University on behalf of The Marshall Project found that as many as 1 in 10 of America's 3,000-plus sheriffs believe they have the authority to stand between their constituents and higher government entities, a tactic they call \"interposition.\"\n\nThe Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, the key organization fueling the movement, led around a dozen training sessions in Texas in 2020 and 2021. A February 2021 session in The Woodlands drew at least 27 sheriffs or deputies. At an October 2021 session in Mesquite, the keynote speaker was Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton , and attendees included state Sen. Bob Hall , R-Edgewood, and former state Sen. Don Huffines, who unsuccessfully challenged Gov. Greg Abbott in the Republican primary for governor. Other attendees have included justices of the peace, police captains and members of the Texas Farm Bureau.\n\nThe seminars count for six to eight hours of continuing training credit required by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, which certifies peace officers. Last summer, the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, a nonprofit advocacy group that tracks far-right organizations, raised concerns that the agency was effectively blessing the training.\n\nIn response to that complaint plus an email from the Anti-Defamation League, TCOLE sent a field agent to attend a July 2021 training session in Houston County, which he recorded. In a one-paragraph report, the agent wrote that \"the class was a study of the law and making sure law enforcement, particularly Sheriffs, were following their oath, standing up for, and protecting the individual rights of every citizen they swore to protect ... some officers [said] that they had not covered this material as in depth before and thought it was a good class.\"\n\nAnother agent attended a session in Burnet County in July 2021 and noted, \"I heard no negative or derogatory comment made, or provided, about any segment of society.\"\n\nTCOLE's director of government relations, Gretchen Grigsby, said in a phone interview for this story that the trainings remain under investigation by her department.\n\nRichard Mack, a former sheriff in southeastern Arizona, founded the CSPOA and has become well known for opposing COVID-related business closures and health measures, holding absolutist views on the Second Amendment and arguing that the federal government is an unwanted intrusion into people's lives. Most recently, the association and Mack have taken to fueling rumors about widespread voter fraud and encouraging sheriffs, in particular, to investigate complaints of voter fraud, which scholars say falls outside their authority.\n\nMack is a former board member of the Oath Keepers, two of whose leaders were recently convicted of seditious conspiracy for their involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol .\n\nRichard Mack, former sheriff of Graham County in Arizona and founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, speaks during a news conference in Las Vegas on July 12, 2022. Credit: REUTERS/Bridget Bennett\n\nAt the event in Las Vegas, Williams acknowledged the controversies around Mack. He explained that he was initially reluctant to attend a training session sponsored by the CSPOA, then looked up Mack on the internet at the suggestion of a community member.\n\n\"According to the internet, Sheriff Mack is the antichrist, so don't believe none of that crap,\" he said with a chuckle, adding that Mack had converted him to the movement. Mack explained the conversion was \"not to the gospel of Jesus Christ, but to the Constitution. Some people think they are one and the same, and I'm one of them.\"\n\nThe constitutional sheriff movement has its roots in the Posse Comitatus (\"power of the county\") movement of the 1970s and '80s.\n\nPosse Comitatus founder William Potter Gale was a self-ordained minister who called on sheriffs to supersede federal agencies and serve as quasi-vigilantes, primarily to resist school desegregation.\n\nHis ideas went on to influence sovereign citizens and militia movements. Many Posse Comitatus adherents were violent; in one incident, an acolyte of Gale's instigated a shootout that left two U.S. Marshals dead. Later, the same man was killed in another shootout, in addition to a local sheriff. Gale himself was convicted of mailing death threats to a judge and IRS agents.\n\nMack, who leads the modern-day sheriffs' movement, counts as an inspiration W. Cleon Skousen , a member of the John Birch Society who proposed that the Constitution was divinely inspired and under attack from communists and liberals.\n\nAfter attending a seminar by Skousen, Mack has said in various speeches and books, he was inspired to run for sheriff in his home county of Graham County, Arizona. He won in 1988 and was reelected in 1992. During his second term, Mack was one of a handful of sheriffs recruited by the National Rifle Association to challenge the gun-sale restrictions of the Brady Bill in court. When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1997 that the federal government could not require state and local governments to conduct background checks, he became a far-right hero.\n\nAfter losing his bid for a third term, Mack began going around the country talking to far-right groups and moved to Fredericksburg, Texas, around 2011 to start the CSPOA . He described a far-right group geared toward recruiting law enforcement officers, although anyone is allowed to join.\n\nA group called the Patriots of Gillespie County was instrumental in persuading Mack to move, advertising on its website that he would \"bring government back to its proper role in these United States.\" (In an email, Mack said he lived in Texas for 20 months \"under contract\" with the group. He did not agree to a phone interview.)\n\nIn 2012, he ran as an far-right, libertarian Republican primary candidate for Congress from Texas' 21st Congressional District , which includes parts of Travis and Bexar counties. (He lost, receiving only 15% of the vote.)\n\nMack stepped down as the formal head of the CSPOA in November, but a CSPOA announcement in November 2022 has said he will retain a leadership role.\n\nMack asserts that elected sheriffs are accountable only to their voters, not judges or legislators, even when other branches of government make or interpet the law. In effect, sheriffs can nullify a law by refusing to enforce it. \"The federal government, the White House, or Congress do not hire us, they cannot fire us, and they cannot tell us what to do,\" he wrote in his 2009 book \"The County Sheriff: America's Last Hope.\"\n\nMainstream legal scholars say the theory is quackery. \"Mack has history wrong, and dangerously so,\" says Robert Tsai, a Boston University law professor. James Madison explicitly repudiated nullification as a doctrine, Tsai said, noting that politicians used the theory to justify the expansion of slavery in the 1850s and to resist desegregation in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic gave Mack and his movement a burst of new attention, as did the unrest in 2020 that followed the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black civilian, by a Minneapolis police officer. He argued in August 2020 that sheriffs could call upon posses to deal with protesters.\n\nAccording to Mack, 27 Texas sheriffs or deputies attended a CSPOA event in February 2021 in The Woodlands. The speakers included:\n\nSpeaking early in the conference, Sheriff Randy Hargrove of Houston County, in East Texas, said that Mack had endorsed both his runs for sheriff and spoke about his struggles enforcing pandemic-related business closures and mask mandates. \"I took a step back and went back to what I had been taught by Sheriff Mack ... look to the Constitution first,\" he said. He explained it was a learning process for him: \"Thank God that we got someone like Sheriff Mack who is out there helping us with that.\"\n\nThen Mack took to the stage. \"We have never and we will never advocate violence of any kind,\" he said, mentioning Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. \"The backdrop of this entire conference is, what is government's role?\"\n\n\"We have sheriffs who will interpose. Stand in the way. And make sure we are not victimizing our citizens all in the name of 'it's for your own good,'\" he said.\n\nLater, Hargrove wrote, \"What this CSPOA training is, in reality, is a good old-fashioned Constitutional Revival!\"\n\nAccording to documents obtained through public records requests from Williams' office, the CSPOA had a list of 50 Texas sheriffs who attended its trainings and at least 50 more it sought to recruit. Some sheriffs sent multiple employees. Williams went to one training with 12 other sworn officers from his office, which cost the office and taxpayers just under $700.\n\nAlong with sheriffs, several elected officials and county judges have attended, according to a CSPOA 2021 year-end report.\n\nA bare-bones syllabus appears to be the only documentation submitted to TCOLE to qualify the CSPOA conferences as training, alongside a letter in which Mack claimed that the syllabus and all his information was proprietary. There are no assessments or other tests at the end of the training sessions, nor is there a textbook or manual.\n\nAfter each event, sheriffs were given a \"Statement of Constitutional Sheriff\" to \"use as a guide in all law enforcement endeavors.\"\n\nIn July 2021, as part of the so-called \"Texas Tour,\" Mack held a training session in Burnet County, in the Hill Country, that offered six hours of TCOLE continuing education credit. Burnet County Sheriff Calvin Boyd provided an introduction, explaining that what people want from a \"constitutional sheriff\" is someone who \"will protect you from a government that attempts to overreach.\"\n\n\"And this thing's grown,\" he continued. \"One of the things we need to change is that this is not radical. It's not radical to follow the rules. It's not radical to follow the Constitution. The other side is pretty good at turning that around.\"\n\nAccording to a recording provided by TCOLE, the law-enforcement-only portion of the training that counts as continuing education credit does not include legal analysis or legislative history. Mack says nullification doctrine \"has nothing to do with racism,\" and merely leaves it to states \"to judge the constitutionality of laws and decrees.\"\n\nInterposition, he has told attendees, is like playing defense in basketball. \"The bureaucrat is here trying to get to the innocent citizens and your job is to stay in the way. You make it messy for them. You make it difficult for them.\"\n\nOther sections of Mack's training are plainly in opposition to the federal government. He told sheriffs and deputies that the IRS \"is violating the constitution\" when it conducts audits. \"If your legislature can legislate anything in your life, they own you,\" he said, saying the government makes people \"slaves\" through laws and excessive government spending.\n\nNot all sheriffs who attend CSPOA training fully buy into the dogma. Sheriff Brad Norman of Ellis County, south of Dallas, said he attended a training but did not remember very much about it. He said he identifies as a \"constitutional sheriff\" but isn't \"part of any card-carrying organization or anything like that.\"\n\nSheriff Trace Hendricks of Bosque County, in Central Texas, said he's gone to three CSPOA trainings over the past two years. He was reluctant to speak about them, he said, because the media was \"trying to make sheriffs look like fools.\"\n\nHendricks said he didn't \"understand the hype\" and certainly doesn't think a sheriff can overrule federal law enforcement. While Hendricks said he identified as a \"constitutional sheriff,\" he added that Mack has \"a couple of points that I disagree with. I didn't go and join any cult.\"\n\nExperts in extremism argue that the CSPOA training events introduce fringe ideas into political discourse that gradually push the Republican Party further to the right.\n\n\"Law enforcement officers and other attendees who took part in trainings or events hosted by constitutional sheriffs have used what they see as their newfound knowledge to speak out or lobby for new policies that are often aligned with a far-right agenda, one that has been developed and promoted by constitutional sheriff's organizations, conspiracy theorists and an anti-immigrant hate group,\" said Rachel Goldwasser of the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\nNowhere is this more evident than in Texas, where Abbott has poured around $2 billion into Operation Lone Star, benefiting sheriffs who can militarize their departments in the name of \"border security.\" (Mack said in an email that the \"disaster at the border\" was a reason Texas sheriffs were interested in his trainings.)\n\nThe Kinney County Courthouse in Brackettville on May 9, 2022. The county's sheriff - on a CSPOA member list - and the county attorney planned to patrol the border by hiring private citizens as an official posse, using state funds. The plans were later dropped after some objections. Credit: Chris Stokes for The Texas Tribune\n\nSome far-right sheriffs willingly partnered - informally at least - with border militias. In Kinney County, for example, the sheriff - who is on a CSPOA member list - and the county attorney wanted to use state funding to hire private citizens , many of whom were members of a local militia called Patriots for America, to conduct patrols of the border: an official posse. Community members and civil rights groups like the ACLU objected, so the plans were dropped. But the sheriff continued to communicate with these militia groups.\n\nThe Operation Lone Star task force is also primarily composed of sheriffs who have attended at least one of Mack's trainings. Sheriff Raymundo Del Bosque of Zapata County has repeatedly praised Operation Lone Star, and his county has received substantial funding from the state.\n\n\"Good always prevails against evil,\" he said at the July 2022 Las Vegas conference. He claimed Operation Lone Star was curbing \"Biden's open-border policies.\"\n\n\"We are holding the front line together,\" he said. \"We need to join the fight and protect the front line.\"\n\nFour Texas sheriffs in leadership positions with the Sheriffs' Association of Texas, which represents sheriffs all over the state, are listed as having attended at least one CSPOA training: Greg Capers of San Jacinto County, Del Bosque of Zapata County, Rand Henderson of Montgomery County and Mark Reynolds of Comal County, according to a list from the CSPOA. None returned calls for comment.\n\nZapata County Sheriff Raymundo Del Bosque holds his hat over his heart during the national anthem at an event held by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association in Las Vegas, Nevada on July 12, 2022. Credit: REUTERS/Bridget Bennett\n\nPart of the reason CSPOA trainings are popular in rural Texas might be linked to the role of the sheriff in Texas life. Texas has 254 counties, and many are lightly populated. Most of the sheriffs who participated in CSPOA trainings run departments with fewer than 50 employees. The Deason Center report on rural Texas sheriffs, the result of a focus group conducted by the Deason Criminal Justice Reform Center at SMU's Dedman School of Law, points out that sheriffs, unlike other law enforcement offices, are elected and maintain connections with their voters in a hands-on, personal way.\n\nMany sheriffs cited community as a reason for joining the CSPOA. Sheriff Cutter Clinton - who joined the CSPOA before he became sheriff of Panola County - shared his experience after Mack at one Texas conference. \"We're blessed that we haven't been troubled with a lot of the troubles that have plagued the country. ... The year 2020, though, we saw things like that. Things we haven't seen ... the different executive orders, the mandates. I began to question a lot of things I believed in for a long time.\" He said a friend referred him to the CSPOA.\n\n\"You got a lot of reading material,\" he said, explaining that such reading helped him make sense of the role of sheriff. He praised the trainings as a chance to be \"among my people.\"\n\nWilliams, the sheriff of Coryell County, has said that after the CSPOA training his \"relationship with the community blossomed.\" All of his deputies, he says, now carry one of Skousen's pocket constitutions.\n\nIn recent months, CSPOA-affiliated sheriffs have aligned with election-denier groups to form coalitions that appear ready to promote \"the big lie\" and pounce on any chance to highlight potential fraud in their communities. At a July event in Las Vegas, at least three Texas sheriffs appeared onstage with Mack to promote a new partnership with True the Vote, a Houston-based organization that peddles election conspiracies. (Mack claimed more Texas sheriffs were in attendance, but that could not be confirmed.)\n\nThese sheriffs have also been influential in the far-right push for more election policing, including concerns that people are voting illegally, worries about the accuracy of voting machines and the desire to appear willing and ready to investigate and arrest individuals, even members of their own county government. In rural Michigan, for example, Sheriff Dar Leaf, who works closely with Mack to steer CSPOA policies, has spent nearly two years investigating what he alleges are local election fraud claims. Despite limited resources, he has a full-time detective focused only on election investigations and has targeted local election officials, making them the target of threats of violence from radicalized community members.\n\nCoryell County Sheriff Scott Williams (second from left) and True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht (third from right) onstage during a Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association event in Las Vegas on July 12, 2022. Credit: REUTERS/Bridget Bennett\n\nWhile it's not clear that all of the Texas sheriffs who attended CSPOA trainings are election-deniers, some expressed those views in interviews. Hendricks, the Bosque County sheriff who did not agree with Mack entirely, said he believes there was election fraud: \"I don't have evidence one way or the other. I follow the news pretty closely, and I'm not comfortable with the way the outcome was.\" In an interview after the press conference in Las Vegas, Williams confirmed: \"Where there's smoke, there's fire,\" when asked about election fraud.\n\nIn November of last year, Mack announced that he would be stepping back from the day-to-day operations of the CSPOA. He said he plans to remain active but has taken a formal position with America's Frontline Doctors , an anti-vaccination group whose founder, Simone Gold , was sentenced to 60 days of incarceration for her role in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6. Sam Bushman, a long-time collaborator with Mack, is now the CEO of CSPOA. Bushman is best known for his daily far-right podcast \"Liberty Roundtable,\" which has hosted guests like Eric Trump , son of the former president; he said in November 2022, \"I don't believe that (convicted Oath Keepers founder) Stewart Rhodes was guilty.\"\n\nShortly after Mack's announcement, Williams appeared as a guest on \"Liberty Roundtable\" with Mack, who discussed the change in command at the CSPOA. Mack said that he hopes other sheriffs will get more involved with CSPOA events and trainings.\n\n\"We are just growing so quickly, and we need sitting sheriffs like Sheriff Williams to help shoulder that load,\" Mack said. Williams is a member of the new CSPOA Advisory Board , alongside Leaf and other well-known far-right sheriffs.\n\nKirk Launius , a one-time candidate for Dallas County sheriff, is the Texas State Director for the CSPOA . He recently said that the CSPOA plans to expand its presence in Texas, using local connections and county groups like the True Texas Project as \"leverage\" and a way to \"grease the skids.\" In another recent podcast , Bushman cited the success of TCOLE certification in Texas as inspiration to expand to other states like Nevada and Utah.\n\nWilliams agreed and added, \"What the CSPOA has done is taken like-minded, liberty-, God-loving sheriffs and brought us together.\"\n\nJessica Pishko is a New America fellow working on a forthcoming book about sheriffs, to be published by Dutton.\n\nDisclosure: Southern Poverty Law Center, Texas Christian University and Texas Farm Bureau have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

      "text": "How Arizona became a 'hotbed' of far-right militias and 'anti-government extremists'\n\nArizona's political climate is radically different from what it was 40 or 50 years ago.\n\nOnce a deep red state that was synonymous with the old-school GOP conservatism of Sens. Barry Goldwater and John McCain, Arizona is now a swing state with a Democratic governor (Katie Hobbs), two Democratic U.S. senators (Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego) and a Democratic state attorney general (Kris Mayes). President Donald Trump carried Arizona in 2024 but lost it to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nMany traditional Goldwater and McCain conservatives are frustrated by the gains that MAGA conspiracy theorists have made in Arizona. And another source of frustration for them is the presence of far-right militia groups in their state.\n\nIn an article published on February 25 , Phoenix News Times reporter T.J. L'Heureux describes seven of the \"most concerning\" far-right groups with a strong Arizona presence - including the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, Arizona Border Recon, Veterans on Patrol, Mayhem Solutions Group, Patriot Front, and the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association.\n\nL'Heureux explains , \"Suffice it to say that hate groups and anti-government extremists have always been attracted to Trump. Now that their man, and Elon Musk, is back in power and dismantling the federal government with reckless abandon, experts who track extremist groups are acutely concerned they will feel emboldened to leave the shadows and operate openly. Those experts have their eyes on Arizona.\"\n\nL'Heureux notes, however , that while \"neo-Nazi, white supremacist, anti-immigrant, (and) anti-Muslim\" groups \"dominate the extremist landscape in the American South and Northeast, they play a secondary role in the Southwest.\"\n\nExtremism expert Kristofer Goldsmith told the Phoenix New Times , \"In Arizona, anti-government groups tend to be the most active.\"\n\nRachel Goldwasser of the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the Phoenix New Times , \"Arizona is a hotbed.... As long as we've determined they're actually out there pushing their propaganda and are recruiting or engaging people and are trying to or successfully radicalizing people, we define that as activity. The groups we look at can be very different in terms of their activities, even if their ideologies are similar.\"\n\nRead the full Phoenix New Times article at this link ."

(AP) - Against the background hum of the convention center, Dar Leaf settled into a club chair to explain the sacred mission of America's sheriffs, his bright blue eyes and warm smile belying the intensity of the cause.\n\n\"The sheriff is supposed to be protecting the public from evil,\" the chief law enforcement officer for Barry County, Michigan, said during a break in the National Sheriffs' Association 2023 conference in June. \"When your government is evil or out of line, that's what the sheriff is there for, protecting them from that.\"\n\nLeaf is on the advisory board of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, founded in 2011 by former Arizona sheriff Richard Mack. The group, known as CSPOA, teaches that elected sheriffs must \"protect their citizens from the overreach of an out-of-control federal government\" by refusing to enforce any law they deem unconstitutional or \"unjust.\"\n\n\"The safest way to actually achieve that is to have local law enforcement understand that they have no obligation to enforce such laws,\" Mack said in an interview. \"They're not laws at all anyway. If they're unjust laws, they are laws of tyranny.\"\n\nThis project was produced by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism , in collaboration with the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting . The Howard Center, based at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, is an initiative of the Scripps Howard Fund in honor of the late news industry executive and pioneer Roy W. Howard. AZCIR is a nonpartisan, nonprofit newsroom that focuses on data-driven investigative journalism. For more see https://azcir.org/cspoa/ . Contact us at [email protected] .\n\nThe sheriffs group has railed against gun control laws, COVID-19 mask mandates and public health restrictions, as well as alleged election fraud. It has also quietly spread its ideology across the country, seeking to become more mainstream in part by securing state approval for taxpayer-funded law enforcement training, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found.\n\nOver the last five years, the group has hosted trainings, rallies, speeches and meetings in at least 30 states for law enforcement officers, political figures, private organizations and members of the public, according to the Howard Center's seven-month probe, conducted in collaboration with the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting.\n\nThe group has held formal trainings on its \"constitutional\" curriculum for law enforcement officers in at least 13 of those states. In six states, the training was approved for officers' continuing education credits. The group also has supporters who sit on three state boards in charge of law enforcement training standards.\n\nLegal experts warn that such training - especially when it's approved for state credit - can undermine the democratic processes enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and is part of what Mary McCord, a former federal prosecutor and executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University, called a \"broader insurrectionist ideology\" that has gripped the nation since the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"They have no authority, not under their state constitutions or implementing statutes to decide what's constitutional and what's not constitutional. That's what courts have the authority to do, not sheriffs,\" McCord said.\n\n\"There's another sort of evil lurking there,\" McCord added, \"because CSPOA is now essentially part of a broader movement in the United States to think it's OK to use political violence if we disagree with some sort of government policy.\"\n\nAt least one state, Texas, canceled credit for the sheriffs' training after determining the course content - which it said included a reference to \"this is a war\" - was more political than educational. But other states, such as Tennessee, have approved the training, in part because it was hosted by a local law enforcement agency.\n\nUnlike other law enforcement continuing education, such as firearms training, the sheriffs' curriculum is largely a polemic on the alleged constitutional underpinnings of sheriffs' absolute authority to both interpret and refuse to enforce certain laws. One brochure advertising the group's seminars states: \"The County Sheriff is the one who can say to the feds, 'Beyond these bounds you shall not pass.'\"\n\nSince 2018, the Howard Center-AZCIR investigation found, at least 69 sheriffs nationwide have either been identified as members of the group or publicly supported it, though at least one later disavowed the organization. A 2021 survey of sheriffs by academic researchers working with the nonprofit Marshall Project found that more than 200 of the estimated 500 sheriffs who responded agreed with the group's ideology.\n\nIn addition, reporters found, at least a dozen U.S. counties influenced by the sheriffs group have considered \"constitutional county\" resolutions over the past two years. The resolutions range from a simple reaffirmation of support for the constitutional rights of county residents to empowering local government, including sheriffs, to refuse to enforce state and federal laws they interpret as unconstitutional. Officials in two Nevada counties - Lander and Elko - have become official CSPOA constitutional counties, a step that includes a $2,500 lifetime fee paid directly to the sheriffs group.\n\nNationwide, there are some 3,000 sheriffs, whose salaries are funded by taxpayers. They serve as the chief law enforcement officers in their counties and are the only elected peace officers in the country. They appoint deputy sheriffs and jailers and service the courts in their jurisdictions. Especially in rural areas, sheriffs hold immense sway over what happens in their county.\n\nAmy Cooter, research director at the Middlebury Institute Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism, said many sheriffs join the group from \"a misinformed but well-meaning perspective.\" But, she added, it also allows some sheriffs to \"potentially engage in extremism by not enforcing legal, lawful, legitimate orders.\"\n\nSome states have pushed back against the group's training efforts, and not all sheriffs subscribe to the group's ideology. Many at the National Sheriffs' Association conference distanced themselves from the constitutional sheriffs or claimed not to know what they were about.\n\n\"When I took an oath 17 years ago as sheriff, I took the oath to uphold the Constitution, not overstep it,\" said Troy Wellman, sheriff of Moody County, South Dakota, and a vice president of the National Sheriffs' Association.\n\nAnd there has been public pushback in some counties led by \"constitutional sheriffs.\" In Klickitat County, Washington, residents alleged Sheriff Bob Songer, a board member of the sheriffs group, engaged in fearmongering and intimidation. He was the target of a formal complaint in 2022 that the state's law enforcement standards agency ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe public-facing image of the sheriffs group, which is led by white men, prominently features the American flag and the experiences of Black civil rights icons who pushed back against unjust laws. But details of its operations are closely held, and its finances are shielded from public scrutiny. It was briefly registered as a nonprofit in Arizona, but internal records indicate it is now a private company.\n\nThe group does not release its list of dues-paying members, nor does it publicize information about where or how it conducts trainings.

(AP) - Against the background hum of the convention center, Dar Leaf settled into a club chair to explain the sacred mission of America's sheriffs, his bright blue eyes and warm smile belying the intensity of the cause.\n\n\"The sheriff is supposed to be protecting the public from evil,\" the chief law enforcement officer for Barry County, Michigan, said during a break in the National Sheriffs' Association 2023 conference in June. \"When your government is evil or out of line, that's what the sheriff is there for, protecting them from that.\"\n\nLeaf is on the advisory board of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, founded in 2011 by former Arizona sheriff Richard Mack. The group, known as CSPOA, teaches that elected sheriffs must \"protect their citizens from the overreach of an out-of-control federal government\" by refusing to enforce any law they deem unconstitutional or \"unjust.\"\n\n\"The safest way to actually achieve that is to have local law enforcement understand that they have no obligation to enforce such laws,\" Mack said in an interview. \"They're not laws at all anyway. If they're unjust laws, they are laws of tyranny.\"\n\nThis project was produced by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism , in collaboration with the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting . The Howard Center, based at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, is an initiative of the Scripps Howard Fund in honor of the late news industry executive and pioneer Roy W. Howard. AZCIR is a nonpartisan, nonprofit newsroom that focuses on data-driven investigative journalism. For more see https://azcir.org/cspoa/ . Contact us at [email protected] .\n\nThe sheriffs group has railed against gun control laws, COVID-19 mask mandates and public health restrictions, as well as alleged election fraud. It has also quietly spread its ideology across the country, seeking to become more mainstream in part by securing state approval for taxpayer-funded law enforcement training, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism found.\n\nOver the last five years, the group has hosted trainings, rallies, speeches and meetings in at least 30 states for law enforcement officers, political figures, private organizations and members of the public, according to the Howard Center's seven-month probe, conducted in collaboration with the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting.\n\nThe group has held formal trainings on its \"constitutional\" curriculum for law enforcement officers in at least 13 of those states. In six states, the training was approved for officers' continuing education credits. The group also has supporters who sit on three state boards in charge of law enforcement training standards.\n\nLegal experts warn that such training - especially when it's approved for state credit - can undermine the democratic processes enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and is part of what Mary McCord, a former federal prosecutor and executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University, called a \"broader insurrectionist ideology\" that has gripped the nation since the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"They have no authority, not under their state constitutions or implementing statutes to decide what's constitutional and what's not constitutional. That's what courts have the authority to do, not sheriffs,\" McCord said.\n\n\"There's another sort of evil lurking there,\" McCord added, \"because CSPOA is now essentially part of a broader movement in the United States to think it's OK to use political violence if we disagree with some sort of government policy.\"\n\nAt least one state, Texas, canceled credit for the sheriffs' training after determining the course content - which it said included a reference to \"this is a war\" - was more political than educational. But other states, such as Tennessee, have approved the training, in part because it was hosted by a local law enforcement agency.\n\nUnlike other law enforcement continuing education, such as firearms training, the sheriffs' curriculum is largely a polemic on the alleged constitutional underpinnings of sheriffs' absolute authority to both interpret and refuse to enforce certain laws. One brochure advertising the group's seminars states: \"The County Sheriff is the one who can say to the feds, 'Beyond these bounds you shall not pass.'\"\n\nSince 2018, the Howard Center-AZCIR investigation found, at least 69 sheriffs nationwide have either been identified as members of the group or publicly supported it, though at least one later disavowed the organization. A 2021 survey of sheriffs by academic researchers working with the nonprofit Marshall Project found that more than 200 of the estimated 500 sheriffs who responded agreed with the group's ideology.\n\nIn addition, reporters found, at least a dozen U.S. counties influenced by the sheriffs group have considered \"constitutional county\" resolutions over the past two years. The resolutions range from a simple reaffirmation of support for the constitutional rights of county residents to empowering local government, including sheriffs, to refuse to enforce state and federal laws they interpret as unconstitutional. Officials in two Nevada counties - Lander and Elko - have become official CSPOA constitutional counties, a step that includes a $2,500 lifetime fee paid directly to the sheriffs group.\n\nNationwide, there are some 3,000 sheriffs, whose salaries are funded by taxpayers. They serve as the chief law enforcement officers in their counties and are the only elected peace officers in the country. They appoint deputy sheriffs and jailers and service the courts in their jurisdictions. Especially in rural areas, sheriffs hold immense sway over what happens in their county.\n\nAmy Cooter, research director at the Middlebury Institute Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism, said many sheriffs join the group from \"a misinformed but well-meaning perspective.\" But, she added, it also allows some sheriffs to \"potentially engage in extremism by not enforcing legal, lawful, legitimate orders.\"\n\nSome states have pushed back against the group's training efforts, and not all sheriffs subscribe to the group's ideology. Many at the National Sheriffs' Association conference distanced themselves from the constitutional sheriffs or claimed not to know what they were about.\n\n\"When I took an oath 17 years ago as sheriff, I took the oath to uphold the Constitution, not overstep it,\" said Troy Wellman, sheriff of Moody County, South Dakota, and a vice president of the National Sheriffs' Association.\n\nAnd there has been public pushback in some counties led by \"constitutional sheriffs.\" In Klickitat County, Washington, residents alleged Sheriff Bob Songer, a board member of the sheriffs group, engaged in fearmongering and intimidation. He was the target of a formal complaint in 2022 that the state's law enforcement standards agency ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nThe public-facing image of the sheriffs group, which is led by white men, prominently features the American flag and the experiences of Black civil rights icons who pushed back against unjust laws. But details of its operations are closely held, and its finances are shielded from public scrutiny. It was briefly registered as a nonprofit in Arizona, but internal records indicate it is now a private company.\n\nThe group does not release its list of dues-paying members, nor does it publicize information about where or how it conducts trainings. The sympathies of the group's leaders for right-wing, white-nationalist extremist causes, however, are well documented.\n\nMack was an early board member of the Oath Keepers, the group involved in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

(AP) - The sheriff in Kansas' most populous county says he took it for granted that local elections ran smoothly - until former President Donald Trump lost there in 2020.\n\nNow he's assigned detectives to investigate what he claims is election fraud, even though there has been no evidence of any widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines in 2020. Calvin Hayden in Johnson County, which covers suburban Kansas City, isn't the only sheriff in the U.S. to try to carve out a bigger role for their office in investigating elections.\n\nPromoters of baseless conspiracy theories that the last presidential election was stolen from Trump are pushing a dubious theory that county sheriffs can access voting machines and intervene in how elections are run - and also have virtually unchecked power in their counties.\n\nVoting-rights advocates and election experts said any attempts by law enforcement to interfere in elections would be alarming and an extension of the threat posed by the continued circulation of Trump's lies about the 2020 election.\n\n\"What we have seen time and again is that those who support the 'Big Lie' find conduits to groups of people who they think can help perpetuate this conspiracy theory and erode confidence in elections and potentially cast doubt on them going forward,\" said David Levine, a former election official who is now a fellow with the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a nonpartisan institute with staff in Washington and Brussels whose mission involves combatting efforts to undermine democratic institutions.\n\nTo be sure, law enforcement can play an important role in elections by sharing intelligence, protecting election workers and equipment, and investigating potential election crimes. But that is typically done after election administrators request the help.\n\nHayden appeared at the \"FreedomFest\" in Las Vegas earlier this month, held by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, although his office said he is not a member of the group.\n\nOnstage with him were sheriffs Dar Leaf of Barry County in southwest Michigan and Chris Schmaling of Racine County in Wisconsin, south of Milwaukee. Both say they are investigating election fraud claims, and both accuse state officials of violating election laws.\n\n\"We've been educating ourselves about elections,\" Hayden told the gathering. \"I've sent my detectives through - I've got a cyber guy. I sent him through to start evaluating what's going on with the machines.\"\n\nHayden, a Republican, did not elaborate and declined to be interviewed this week, citing what he said was his ongoing investigation. State and local election officials in Kansas said his office has not gained access to voting machines, and other Johnson County officials said there are no indications of any problems with the 2020 elections there.\n\nThe constitutional sheriffs' group declares on its website that a sheriff's power in a county is greater than that of any other official and \"even supersedes the powers of the President.\" Leaf filed a lawsuit in June against Michigan's attorney general and secretary of state, accusing them of trying to stifle his investigation. He said a sheriff \"has no superiors in his county.\"\n\nThe \"constitutional sheriffs\" movement has gained visibility in recent years, as some sheriffs - including Hayden - resisted enforcing mask or vaccination requirements during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"All of a sudden, it's like the lights went on. It's the sheriffs,\" said Catherine Engelbrecht, founder of the election-conspiracy group True the Vote, speaking as part of a panel at the recent constitutional sheriffs gathering in Las Vegas. \"That's who can do these investigations. That's who we can trust.\"\n\nIt's not clear how many sheriffs are part of the movement, though the national group's founder, Richard Mack, said last year that about 300 of the nation's 3,000 sheriffs were members, according to The Washington Post. Mack did not respond this week to telephone and email requests for an interview.\n\n\"It's like a lot of these theories - it legally has no basis whatsoever,\" said Stephen McAllister, the top federal prosecutor for Kansas during most of the Trump administration. \"They are subject to state law. They are certainly subject to federal law. They are not sort of supreme little kings within their counties, whether they think so or not.\"\n\nHayden said in a public statement that since the fall of 2021, he has received more than 200 tips alleging fraud in local elections. He said his department has a legal obligation to investigate \"any criminal claim.\"\n\nBut a memo from Peg Trent, Johnson County's chief legal counsel, suggested Hayden went further in a July 5 meeting with her and county election officials.\n\nTrent said Hayden questioned the use of ballot drop boxes at libraries, called for limiting the hours they would be available and offered to have his staff pick up the ballots. She said his staff also asked to have a deputy in the room as ballots are counted.\n\n\"As we discussed, my concern is that these requests give the appearance that the Sheriff's office is attempting to interfere with an election,\" she wrote in the July 7 memo, sent to Hayden, county commissioners and the county manager.\n\nHayden issued a statement that he would \"whole-heartedly disagree\" with her account of the meeting.\n\nThere is no evidence to support Trump's claims of a stolen election in 2020 or to suggest widespread fraud or tampering with voting machines or ballot drop boxes . Dozens of legal claims made by Trump and his allies after the election were rejected by judges , including ones appointed by Trump.\n\n\"With the exception of a tiny handful of individual cases of voter fraud around the country, there is absolutely no reason to suspect that a crime was committed in 2020 with regard to the election,\" said David Becker, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney and election law expert who now leads the Center for Election Innovation and Research.\n\nBut false claims have sowed doubt among many Republican voters , triggered death threats to election officials and led to a host of new voting restrictions in GOP-controlled states. Trump allies have sought access to voting equipment and turned the normally routine process of certifying election results contentious.\n\n\"The danger of anyone embracing a conspiracy theory is the loss of confidence in election results,\" said Chris Harvey, the former state elections director in Georgia. \"It's an added danger if it's law enforcement. Their job is to enforce laws and maintain order. If they are seen as not having confidence in what's going on, it's just going to further trickle down into society.\"\n\nHarvey is part of a new group bringing together election officials and law enforcement. The Committee for Safe and Secure Elections is comprised of 32 current and former election and law enforcement officials, with a goal of build stronger relationships and providing training.\n\nKansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, the state's top election official, said Hayden has not contacted his office as part of his investigation. Schwab has repeatedly said he is confident that state elections ran well in 2020.\n\n\"I think overwhelmingly people trust the election system,\" he said.\n\nHayden said during the Las Vegas gathering that his concerns about election fraud were piqued after Democrat Joe Biden carried Johnson County in the 2020 presidential election because the county had consistently \"voted Republican\" for more than a century. But that argument - made by election conspiracy promoters - ignores that Democrats have carried Johnson County multiple times in governor's races during that time, including in Laura Kelly's winning campaign in 2018.\n\nRepublicans maintain their traditional advantage in voter registration there, but Johnson County is more Democratic than it was 30 years ago.\n\n\"Johnson County going for Biden - well, that's not an anomaly,\" said Davis Hammet, leader of the Kansas voting-rights group Loud Light. \"That happened in suburban counties all across the country.\"\n\n___\n\nCassidy reported from Atlanta.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nThe state Senate on Tuesday passed a proposal that would require some Texas sheriffs to enter into agreements with the federal government to help identify undocumented immigrants accused of crimes.\n\nSenate Bill 8, filed by Republican state Sens. Joan Huffman of Houston and Charles Schwertner of Georgetown, would require sheriffs in counties with more than 100,000 residents to request a 287(g) agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThe bill would also create a $20 million fund to give grants to sheriff's offices in counties with fewer than 1 million residents that enter into agreements with ICE. The grants would help cover costs a county would incur as part of a 287(g) agreement, such as detaining a person in jail for potential immigration violations.\n\nThe bill, which passed on a 20-11 vote, also allows the state Attorney General's Office to sue a sheriff if the state believes that a sheriff is not complying with the law.\n\nThe bill was amended to allow the attorney general to file such lawsuits in the sheriff's county rather than in Travis County, where government-related lawsuits are typically filed. Travis County is also one of the state's more liberal counties.\n\nThe bill now moves on to the state House of Representatives.\n\nThe 287(g) program allows U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to train selected law enforcement officers and deputize them to help enforce immigration laws. The federal program has two main models historically used by participating law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe jail enforcement model allows selected and ICE-trained local officers to question inmates in local jails about their immigration status and hold them for ICE if the deputy suspects the person is in the country illegally. The second model is known as a warrant service officer, which allows ICE-trained police officers to serve administrative immigration warrants.\n\nGenerally, if ICE takes a suspected undocumented immigrant into custody, local prosecutors would have to drop any charges against the person so ICE can start deportation proceedings. Or ICE can wait to pick up the person after their local criminal case has been adjudicated.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick designated SB 8 among his top priorities for the legislative session even before it was filed.\n\nAs of early March, 43 Texas law enforcement agencies already had 287(g) agreements in place, the majority of which are for the jail programs. Only the attorney general's office, Nixon Police Department and sheriffs in Goliad and Smith counties had signed 287(g) agreements for the \"task force model\" that grants police limited immigration enforcement authority while conducting their routine duties.\n\nSome Senate Democrats spoke against the proposal on Tuesday, saying it would cost a lot of money, especially if a county with over a million residents can't apply for the state grant.\n\nA couple of Democratic lawmakers pointed out that some law enforcement agencies that have participated in the 287(g) program have racially profiled Latinos while doing immigration enforcement - particularly former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona.\n\nA federal judge convicted Arpaio of criminal contempt in 2017 for ignoring a previous federal judge's orders to stop conducting immigration-related raids. In 2011, a different federal judge found that Arpaio's deputies to racially profiled Latinos during immigration-related raids as part of his 287(g) implementation.\n\nPresident Trump pardoned him in 2017 and Arpaio later lost his reelection bid. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office is now prohibited from enforcing immigration laws.\n\nSchwertner defended his proposal, saying that it's important for local law enforcement to be able to identify undocumented immigrants during their day-to-day duties.\n\n\"The 287(g) program is about identifying criminality, not nationality,\" Schwertner said.\n\n___\n\nThis story was originally published by The Texas Tribune and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Doug Ducey's stay-at-home order as the state continues to deal with the coronavirus.\n\nMohave County Sheriff Doug Schuster and Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb both said they aren't going to hand out fines, citations or arrest people who disobey the governor's mandate that has been extended through May 15.\n\nMohave County is in northwestern Arizona with Pinal County located south of Phoenix. Of Arizona's 15 counties, the state's two most populous - Maricopa and Pima - have the most COVID-19 cases by far.\n\n\"I'm not going to make criminals out of law-abiding citizens,\" Schuster told Phoenix TV station KTVK. \"As a sheriff, I cannot in good conscience issue citations or arrest people for not social distancing.\"\n\n\"It's unfortunate that we're here but I need to make a stand for the people and for freedom,\" Lamb said. \"I don't want to cite, fine or arrest fine people.\"\n\nDucey already has laid out consequences for violating his stay-at-home order: a $2,500 fine and up to six months in jail.\n\nBut Schuster and Lamb said they will not enforce the mandate.\n\nThe two sheriffs said they're not encouraging people to break the governor's order but feel compelled to uphold the constitution.\n\n\"We recognize the sacrifices people have made throughout this health emergency,\" a statement from the Governor's Office said. \"We know many Arizonans are feeling economic pain and we're doing everything we can to alleviate that while ensuring health and safety.\"\n\nMeanwhile, state health officials said Sunday that Arizona now has 8,640 coronavirus cases and 362 known deaths, an increase of 276 cases and 14 deaths since Saturday's released figures.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services said more than 76% of the people who have died of coronavirus were ages 65 and older.\n\nA majority of the deaths have come in Maricopa County (4,585) and Pima County (1,326).\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nWASHINGTON, April 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- A letter signed by 275 sheriffs from all across the United States was sent to President Joe Biden on April 7 imploring him to secure the nation's borders and end the illegal migration crisis raging at our southern border. The sheriffs, representing 39 states, expressed their grave concerns about the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border and laid the blame squarely on the president's policies.\n\n\"America's Sheriffs are deeply troubled about the dangerous impacts your administration's border policies are having on our citizens, legal residents and communities,\" they wrote. The elected law enforcement officials, from both political parties, demanded that the Biden administration take immediate action to restore order at the border. \"You must act now before our nation's public safety resources are overwhelmed with the criminal side effects of unchecked illegal immigration, including transnational gangs, guns, dangerous drugs and human trafficking,\" they warned.\n\nMark Morgan, a Senior Fellow at the Federation for American Immigration Reform and former chief of the U.S. Border Patrol and former acting director of Customs and Border Protection reaffirmed the urgency of the sheriffs' demand for action. \"I have just returned from the southern border. What I witnessed was nothing short of an unprecedented humanitarian disaster, and a national security and public health crisis - one which was created by this administration beginning the day President Biden took office.\n\n\"The president's open border policies are directly responsible for the abuse and death of children at the hands of criminal cartels, and an invitation to criminals and terrorists to prey on the American people. Hundreds of sheriffs and other law enforcement professionals, as well as local government officials in affected communities are telling the president it is time for immediate action, not words, to end the crisis he created.\"\n\nDan Stein, president of FAIR, concurred with the sheriffs' assessment of the dangers of the Biden immigration policies. \"These local law enforcement officials have been dealing with the impact of unsecured borders for decades, as criminal cartels have taken root in their communities. Every day, as the Biden administration releases people we know nothing about, into communities all across the nation, the threats to public safety and public health grow evermore grave. President Biden has the obligation and the ability to restore policies that were in place when he took office that had checked the flow of migrants crossing our borders. He has a moral and constitutional obligation to do so immediately.\"\n\nThe full text of the sheriffs' letter and signatories can be found here .\n\nContact: Matthew Tragesser, 202-328-7004 or [email protected]\n\nABOUT FAIR\n\nFounded in 1979, FAIR is the country's largest immigration reform group.

(AP) - A bill that would require North Carolina sheriffs to comply with requests by federal agents interested in picking up jail inmates believed to be in the country illegally passed a Senate committee Tuesday, making it the first major legislation to advance in this year's work session.\n\nThe bill already cleared the House last year but stalled in the Senate until it was approved by the chamber's judiciary committee on a voice vote. The Senate action signals the measure is a priority for state Republicans who now hold narrow veto-proof majorities in both chambers. A full Senate vote could come later this week.\n\nTwo earlier editions of the bill passed the legislature in 2019 and 2022, only to be successfully vetoed by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper because Democrats held more seats than today. GOP election gains mean Republicans can override a potential Cooper veto this year if they stay united. Cooper has said a previous version was \"only about scoring political points\" by the GOP on immigration.\n\nThe bill essentially requires sheriffs or jailers in all 100 counties to hold inmates accused of violent felonies or some misdemeanors up to 48 hours if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued what's called a detainer. It also requires the involvement of judicial officials to order law enforcement to hold the inmate in question, according to the bill.\n\nIn an ICE detainer request, immigration agents ask to be notified before the release from a local jail of a defendant whom the agency believes is in the country unlawfully.\n\nSheriffs or other law enforcement officials already are tasked with checking an inmate's legal status if they are charged with serious crimes, according to state law. If a determination cannot be made on someone's legal status, a query should be sent to ICE.\n\nBut not all sheriffs are following through with those queries, said Rep. Destin Hall, a Caldwell County Republican and a sponsor of the bill who spoke at Tuesday's committee hearing. Hall added that a group of sheriffs - primarily Democrats from urban counties - have resisted compliance with detainers, which critics say aren't true arrest warrants. He said those shortcomings inspired a need for the bill.\n\n\"To me, it is amazing that we have to have a bill like this,\" Hall said. \"It seems to be common sense that law enforcement should cooperate with one another.\"\n\nHall said the bill would make communities safer. He cited incidents where federal immigration officers should have been contacted about an inmate, but they were later released and went on to commit more crimes.\n\nRockingham County Sheriff Sam Page, a Republican, spoke in support of the legislation, saying it would \"remove criminal offenders from our communities.\"\n\nMost public speakers during the hearing opposed the measure, however. Lawyers, activists and small business owners voiced concern that the bill could lead to North Carolina's immigrant community feeling unsafe and unwelcome.\n\nThe legislation also raises serious constitutional concerns of due process violations and causes more problems for law enforcement, said Sejal Zota, legal director with the Just Futures Law group, which assists immigrants.\n\n\"The bill interferes with communities and sheriffs' decisions about local resources and priorities, exposes sheriffs and counties to expensive lawsuits for constitutional violation and further erodes community trust in law enforcement,\" said Andressia Ramirez of the North Carolina Justice Center, which advocates for low-income residents.\n\nMecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden, one of the Democratic sheriffs who doesn't comply with detainer requests, said last week the bill is an \"absolutely\" political move that unfairly targets sheriffs in urban counties. But he said he would comply with the law if the bill should be enacted - even if he had some questions on how it would affect county resources.\n\nAn amendment approved Tuesday by the committee in part would allow anyone to file a complaint with state Attorney General's Office if the person alleged a sheriff or jail administrator wasn't abiding by the proposed legislation. The attorney general could then ask a judge to force the jailer to comply.\n\nThe bill must clear one more Senate committee. Wilson County Republican Sen. Buck Newton, a judiciary committee co-chairman, told reporters it was a \"reasonable expectation\" for the bill to be voted on the Senate floor this week. The House also would have to formally agree to the Senate changes for it to reach Cooper's desk.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "Directive by sheriffs to hold jailed for ICE backed by House\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - North Carolina House Republicans pushed legislation through their chamber Wednesday requiring all county sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration agents, particularly by complying with written requests to hold criminal defendants.\n\nBut the party-line 63-51 vote to force sheriffs to fulfill Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer requests signals that GOP lawmakers could find themselves short in overcoming any potential veto by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The measure now goes to the Senate.\n\nThe bill is a direct response to recent actions by a handful of newly elected sheriffs - all Democrats - to pull back on working with ICE agents. Some say they won't honor the detainers, which give agents up to 48 hours to pick up suspects on the belief they are in the country unlawfully.\n\nThe detainers aren't arrest warrants, and for now it's voluntary for sheriffs to accept them. Bill sponsors said recent refusals by sheriffs - like those in Wake, Durham and Buncombe counties - to comply with the detainers mean certain defendants are going free on bond, when they could be awaiting deportation instead.\n\n\"This is about criminals. It's that simple,\" said Rep. Brenden Jones, a Columbus County Republican. \"It is this body's duty and responsibility to ensure that local governments are not endangering the whole state.\"\n\nImmigration advocacy and victims' assistance groups say the measure will discourage victims of crime - who also may be in the country unlawfully - from coming to deputies for fear they will be wrongly charged and returned to their native countries. They are worried although the legislation makes clear compliance with the detainer doesn't apply to crime victims or witnesses.\n\nDemocrats say the proposal is politically motivated, arguing Republicans seek to punish these new Democratic sheriffs even though the sheriffs were duly elected by local citizens.\n\n\"It's not about public safety. It's about gotcha politics, in my opinion,\" said House Minority Leader Darren Jackson, a Wake County Democrat. Sheriffs already are required to determine whether people charged with felonies or impaired driving and placed in their jails are lawful U.S. residents. The measure expands that to people charged with any criminal offense.\n\nThe measure says sheriffs who don't comply with detainers or other state immigration laws could face litigation by private citizens, with potential fines of up to $25,500 a day for repeat offenses.\n\nRepublicans rejected calls by the North Carolina Sheriffs' Association this week to delay votes to give them time to survey their members or work toward a solution that didn't require changing the law.\n\nThe association came out in opposition to the measure hours before Wednesday's floor debate.\n\nAlthough it appears a majority of the 100 county sheriffs honor detainers, the association statement said, \"the people of each county, as reflected by the decision of their elected sheriff, should retain the ability to decide which lawful method they will utilize in complying with existing federal and state law.\"\n\nBill opponents last week already urged Cooper to veto the measure should it come to his desk. A Cooper spokesman last week said the governor had \"serious concerns about taking away local authority and making it harder for local law enforcement to do their jobs.\"\n\nThe bill doesn't address the federal 287(g) program, in which local law enforcement agencies reach voluntary agreements with ICE to essentially carry out federal immigration laws. Wake and Mecklenburg county sheriffs also are ending participation in that program.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "Meet the Rogue Sheriffs Who Won't Enforce Obama's Gun Proposals\n\nObama and Biden met with a group of sheriffs and police chiefs this afternoon, calling them a representation of law-enforcement officials across the country. But the truly not gun-shy are these 100-something sheriffs - and counting.\n\nPresident Obama and Vice-President Biden met with a group of sheriffs and police chiefs this afternoon, calling them a representation of law-enforcement officials across the country as the administration continues pushing new gun policies. \"I know that this is not a shy group,\" Obama said before sitting down with 13 cops from the sites of massacre (Newtown, Aurora, Tuscon) and all-too-regular gun related violence (Chicago, Philadelphia). But the truly not gun-shy are the more than 90 sheriffs - and counting - from across gun-rights America unified in their vow to oppose Obama's executive actions as well as measures headed for heated debate in Congress.\n\n\"No group is more important for us to listen to than our law enforcement officials,\" Obama said. \"They are where the rubber hits the road.\" It appears, however, that on the ground in places like Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and beyond, sheriffs may be the better measure of outspoken law enforcement. For instance, Obama met with the police chief of Salt Lake City, Utah, but nearly every sheriff in that entire state thinks doesn't agree with the administration. Here's a roundup of the standout sheriffs who, based on a legal interpretations of the constitution or not, say they'll be disobeying the president and Washington:\n\nAll the sheriffs in Utah (except for Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder) think firearms aren't the problem :\n\nWith the number of mass shootings America has endured, it is easy to demonize firearms; it is also foolish and prejudiced ... Firearms are nothing more than instruments, valuable and potentially dangerous, but instruments nonetheless.\n\nSheriff John Cooke of Colorado's Weld County says he doesn't have the resources :\n\nI'm not going to help him in any way ... I'm not going to enforce it because it's unenforceable and because I don't have the resources. The federal government doesn't have the resources.\n\nArizona Sheriff Paul Bebeu (who once had hopes for a seat in Congress) thinks guns are like cars :\n\nAmerica has seen an even higher number of our citizens killed by impaired drivers involved in automobile collisions. Why are you not seeking to remove vehicles from our roadways?....it's because you realize it's the drivers who are at fault and not the vehicle they were driving. This same analogy holds true with these shootings....it's not the gun that's at fault but rather the criminals who use them. Do you honestly feel that any criminal or someone who is mentally ill will obey an executive order made by you related to \"gun control?\" Criminals get their name, because they don't follow our laws already Mr. President.\n\nThose sheriffs are just a small part of a bigger group - nearly 100 have now signed on to a petition to oppose Obama's gun initiatives by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. CSPOA, formed in 2011, is run by pro-gun rights former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack. Mack and his organizations were identified by Southern Poverty Law Center,as an anti-government group and part of the \"Patriot\" movement. They wrote in their winter 2012 report:\n\nOver the past two years, Mack has been working to bring county sheriffs nationwide into the fold of the Patriot movement. He formed the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association in 2011 to advance the principle that sheriffs must resist the government.\n\nAnd CSPOA's website reads :\n\nThe county sheriff is the line in the sand. The county sheriff is the one who can say to the feds, \"Beyond these bounds you shall not pass.\" This is not only within the scope of the sheriff's authority; it's the sheriff's sworn duty\n\nBelow is the current list of Sheriffs who have signed the CSPOA's pledge against Obama's gun initiatives , which doesn't come loaded with many specifics about executive actions as opposed to actual legislation, but does have this here angry video:\n\nLIST OF STATE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATIONS\n\n1.

      "text": "The Arizona Two-Step: A Tale of a Pair of Dusty Old Sheriffs\n\nOne longtime Arizona sheriff--let's call him \"Sheriff A\" for ease of reference--is currently under investigation by federal authorities for failing to adequately cooperate in a civil rights investigation. The Justice Department last year was forced to sue the veteran lawman to enforce its rights . That lawsuit is pending . In addition, last October, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Sheriff A was depriving pre-trial detainees of their constitutional rights. The resolution of that case, too, is pending\n\nMeanwhile, last July, a Pima County Superior Court judge ordered a contempt hearing against Sheriff A to proceed after the law enforcement official failed or refused to turn over certain documents as part of a local investigation into what some believe are substantial financial irregularities and mismanagement within Sheriff A's office. That case also is pending. The resultant controversy, however, didn't stop Sheriff A from campaigning around the country last fall for candidates who agree with his views on immigration.\n\nTo get a sense of the local concerns facing Sheriff A, here's part of a May 2010 report from the Arizona Republic:\n\nCounty budget officials believe money from the sheriff's detention fund may have paid for operations not required by state law. The money comes from a jail-excise tax approved by voters and its use is restricted. Using county human-resources data, information from a racial-profiling lawsuit and conversations with Barkell, officials believe that many sheriff's employees are not working in the same job assignments recorded for them in county records. If jail tax dollars were used to fund staffers performing duties not allowed under the tax, officials said, the money would have to be paid back. The magnitude of the problem ranges from $500,000 to a worst-case scenario of $50 million if the problem stretches to 2006.\n\nAnother longtime Arizona sheriff--let's call him \"Sheriff D\"--also has a penchant for making headlines, sometimes for the wrong reasons and often over matters involving immigration .  But he has no such material pending lawsuits against him or his office by federal or state authorities. Or at least none that I could find. There are no public allegations from the Justice Department, for example, that Sheriff D failed to enforce the Constitution; no federal appeals court order confirming a trial judge's ruling that he's currently in violation of the law. But on January 8th, in the wake of the Tucson shootings, Sheriff D said this :\n\n\"When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol that comes out of certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous,\" said the sheriff. \"And unfortunately, Arizona I think has become sort of the capital. We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry...\n\n\"There's reason to believe that this individual may have a mental issue. And I think people who are unbalanced are especially susceptible to vitriol... People tend to pooh-pooh this business about all the vitriol we hear inflaming the American public by people who make a living off of doing that. That may be free speech, but it's not without consequences.\"\n\nSo guess which sheriff a Utah anti-immigration group , and many conservatives and Tea Party members in Arizona and elsewhere, now want to \"indict\" and recall from office? No, it's not Sheriff A, Maricopa County's famous Joe Arpaio, whose public finances have been questioned by local authoities, whose law enforcement tactics had been deemed violative of the Constitution by the federal courts, and who proudly boasted last year (on Twitter, no less) that he gave Sarah Palin a pair of pink panties. Instead, it's Sheriff D, as in Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik.\n\nWhy? Because on January 8th \"Sheriff Dupnik engaged in shameless political grandstanding, a lack of objectivity and was out of line,\" said Dan Baltes, whose group is leading the charge against the 50-year veteran of public service. \"As one [group] member put it, 'The Sheriff has forever sullied his office, his badge and department.'\" When asked about his politics, Baltes said over the weekend: \"I believe the Constitution is the governing document for our country. In that regard it is my opinion that adhering to the Constitution would be the center and what we should strive for as an expectation.\"\n\nShameless political grandstanding ... sullying a sheriff's office and department ... failing to \"adhere\" to the Constitution.... Hey, folks, are you sure you are trying to kick out the right lawman?"

      "text": "The Neglected Criminal-Justice Problem\n\nJails haven't gotten as much attention as other criminal-justice problems. A new wave of sheriffs is trying to change that.\n\nMasthead Weekly 07.12.19\n\nYou're receiving this exclusive email because you're a valued Atlantic member. Do you like this newsletter? Let us know .\n\nBy David A. Graham\n\nWhat we're watching: The great thing about longform journalism is that a writer gets to put everything he wants into his stories, right? Ha, as if. In my recent report on the progressive sheriffs who took power in North Carolina in November-and like-minded law enforcers around the country-I focused on immigration enforcement, because it's an issue of national importance that spotlights the tension points between federal, state, and local governments.\n\nI didn't give as much attention as I might have liked to the reform of county jails and detention centers. Conditions in lockups have been an important issue in many of the races where progressive sheriffs have won elections, and the ones I profiled often seemed happier to talk about that than the divisive subject of immigration.\n\nWhy it matters: Much of the national conversation about criminal-justice reform in recent years has focused on prisons, both public and private, while jails have not gotten the same attention. Yet they deal with many more people- roughly 10 million in 2017 -than prisons, and though they're ostensibly short-term facilities, many people end up spending weeks or months in jail because they're unable to post bail. Many arrestees are struggling with mental illness or addiction . Jails can also be very dangerous. In Durham County, where I live, the biggest factor in the defeat of the incumbent sheriff was the string of nine deaths in the jail over the past few years. Jail deaths in the state at large have hit a record number.\n\nWhat we're asking: Preventing jail deaths, treating the ill and addicted, and reducing recidivism are much less politically controversial than immigration-but talking about these goals is easier than actually achieving them. So what's being done?\n\nBuncombe County Sheriff Quentin Miller is overseeing the most interesting work on jails that I've heard about. He's launched a series of online dashboards so that anyone can look up the county jail population, historical trends, and demographic information. He is also designing a medically assisted therapy program for people with addictions. Arrestees might get treatment for addiction when they're locked up, but if they don't have support when they get out, they risk relapse-followed by return to the jail. So Miller is working to find organizations who can help them continue their treatment outside. \"What I'm going to stress in law enforcement: Those are not inmates,\" Miller told me. \"Those are clients. We need to treat people as if they are clients.\"\n\nWhat's next: As with any untested program, there's no telling whether these ventures will work until they've had time to take effect. If they work, they could help pave the way for reforms in other counties. If they don't, they pose a political peril: The reformist sheriffs won by convincing voters that they could do better than the old-school incumbents, but if they don't succeed, they could be bounced out just as easily. Miller isn't sweating the politics, though. \"Some of this has come down for me to not being afraid to fail,\" he said. \"If we want to do something different, we have to try something different. If it doesn't work, it doesn't mean we failed. It means we can mark it off the list and try something different.\"\n\nNotes on the news to come\n\nSet to have its wide release next Friday, Disney's new CGI-heavy remake of The Lion King is among the first few in the litany of reboots that the entertainment conglomerate has begun debuting. As such, it's both a stand-alone work and a fascinating example of Disney's competing business and artistic priorities. The Jon Favreau-directed movie is at once a nostalgia play-Some Millennials have kids of their own now!-and an attempt by the company to reach younger audiences. But even if Millennial audiences are capable of feeling the devastation of Mufasa's death anew, the 2019 movie presents larger concerns about Disney's commitment to the spirit of its own work. Ultimately, the 2019 Lion King is an uncanny production: a sometimes bizarre mélange of Planet Earth -esque visuals and youthful, animalian dialogue that retroactively tarnishes the delight of the 1994 version.\n\nSome election junkies live for the horse race. And some live to know how the horses are lined up ... and exactly how that decision was made. On Thursday, CNN will air a live drawing to determine which Democratic primary candidates will attend which of the cable network's two debates on July 30 and 31. To qualify , each participant will need 1 percent of support in three accepted polls or to have 650,000 individual campaign donors, with at least 200 unique donors in 20 unique states. If your eyes are glazing over, this live drawing might not be for you. But while critics might call CNN's airing a ratings play , perhaps CNN deserves a point for transparency. NBC's own sorting piled most major contenders into the second night,  leaving the first two debates rather asymmetrical . And the network was criticized for rostering off camera. However absurd this political ode to the NBA Draft Lottery might look, CNN could just be learning from NBC's example.\n\nLast year, Pakistan's northwestern tribal belt was merged into the neighboring province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, assigning, as Radio Mashaal put it, the 35-million-strong Pashtun minority the same constitutional rights as other Pakistanis. But members of the Pashtun civil-rights movement PTM are furious that the military remains dominant in the region, a vestige of a decade of government operations against terrorism that displaced millions of tribal residents. The region's first-ever election to choose representation for the tribes is now due on July 20, after an earlier attempt was delayed. PTM protesters have fought with the army, which candidates fear will commandeer the election. \"Our offices are being raided. Some of our comrades were arrested, while others fear arrest,\" one candidate told Radio Mashaal about a crackdown on his party due to its support of PTM. \"If these conditions persist, how can we campaign? What kind of an election are we going to see?\"\n\nJustice is coming for Joaquín Guzmán, the Mexican drug lord better known as \"El Chapo.\" At the peak of his crimes, the brutal kingpin ran one of the world's largest drug networks and was responsible for dumping more than 1.2 million kilos of cocaine into the U.S., as well as ordering lackeys to kidnap, torture, and murder rivals.

      "text": "Border Sheriffs Perplexed by Rick Perry's Plan to Send 1,000 Troops to Stare at Mexico\n\nNational Guard members aren't allowed to pursue or detain immigrants, \"or investigate crimes, make arrests, stop and search vehicles, or seize drugs,\" according to The Washington Post .\n\nWhy would you spend millions of dollars sending troops to the border who can't actually detain anyone? That's what some Texas sheriffs of border towns are asking in the wake of Gov. Rick Perry's plan to send 1,000 National Guards members to the Texas/Mexico border in the next month, according to the Dallas Morning News . For them, it would be more useful to spend the money on hiring more deputies and police, aka people who are allowed to detain migrants.\n\n\"I don't know what good they can do,\" Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio told the Dallas Morning News . \"You just can't come out here and be a police officer.\" Lucio and other sheriffs said they weren't consulted before Perry's announcement and, in Lucio's opinion, the police and Border Patrol agents were handling the small uptick in crime. \" At this time, a lot of people do things for political reasons. I don't know that it helps,\" Lucio said.\n\nThis isn't the first time people have questioned the wisdom of sending National Guard troops to the border. In 2010, President Obama sent over 1,000 troops to the border. They weren't allowed to pursue or detain immigrants, \"or investigate crimes, make arrests, stop and search vehicles, or seize drugs,\" The Washington Post reported in 2011. \"Nor do they check Mexico-bound vehicles for bulk cash or smuggled weapons headed to the drug cartels.\" Basically, they keep watch and radio in any suspicious activity. Critics also argued that the National Guard's help cost an estimated $6,271 per person caught.\n\nBut defenders of sending the guard argue they are a deterrent. In the upcoming deployment, guard officials said they would have some medical training and be supplied with water. Still, the most immediate reward is political, and as The New York Times noted , Perry stands the most to gain for being tough on the border.\n\nIn 2012, one of his major gaffes was calling people \"heartless\" for panning his plan to give undocumented students in-state tuition. This time around he won't make the same mistake. \"Drug cartels, human traffickers and individual criminals are exploiting this tragedy for their own criminal opportunities,\" Perry said Monday. \"I will not stand idly by while our citizens are under assault, and little children from Central America are detained in squalor.\""

      "text": "The Sheriff Who's Defying ICE\n\nGarry McFadden is taking a stand. But will North Carolina's legislature strip his office of the powers he's using?\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C.-In 2006, Luis Pineda-Ancheta was arrested in Arizona; charged with illegal entry into the United States, a civil offense; and deported back to his native Honduras. At some point in the next 13 years-authorities don't know when-he returned to the U.S. and ended up in North Carolina.\n\nIn April, a woman reported to police in Charlotte that Pineda-Ancheta had grabbed her and threatened to kill her. Eleven days later, the woman again complained to police that he had again attacked her. On May 15, police arrested Pineda-Ancheta and brought him to the Mecklenburg County detention center, where he was charged with one felony and five misdemeanors.\n\nAny suspect goes through a palimpsest of systems when arrested. In this case, local police apprehended Pineda-Ancheta. He came before a state district-court judge, who set his bond and conditions of release, and was then locked up in a jail run by the Mecklenburg County sheriff's office. When Pineda-Ancheta was arrested, his name was also entered into an FBI database, from which it is available to local, state, and federal law-enforcement officials.\n\nWhen Immigration and Customs Enforcement matched his name with the 2006 deportation, it sent a request, known as a detainer, to MCSO, asking the sheriff to hold Pineda-Ancheta for up to 48 hours until ICE could come and arrest him, even if he posted his bond. If Pineda-Ancheta had been arrested the year before, that's exactly what would have happened.\n\nBut Garry McFadden, the county's new sheriff, was elected in November after campaigning on the promise to reduce MCSO's cooperation with ICE. He told voters he would withdraw from the formal cooperation arrangement with ICE known as 287(g), and stop honoring the agency's detainers-which are requests for voluntary cooperation, not criminal warrants. In December, the day after he was sworn in, McFadden formally put those policies in place.\n\nThat's why Pineda-Ancheta walked out of the detention center in downtown Charlotte on May 17, after posting the $5,000 bond set by the judge. Five days later, the same woman called the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department again. She told police Pineda-Ancheta kidnapped her, stuffed a cloth in her mouth, placed a rope around her neck, and led her into a stand of trees-but he tripped, allowing her to escape.\n\nOn May 23, dozens of cops swarmed an apartment complex in South Charlotte. Pineda-Ancheta barricaded himself in an apartment, and then, police said, slipped into the walls of the building. When he was finally arrested on new felony charges, after nine hours, Pineda-Ancheta once again came before a district-court judge, who set bond of $65,000 and required electronic monitoring. Once again, ICE issued a detainer to MCSO. Once again, Pineda-Ancheta met the conditions for release and was set free.\n\nBy now, federal authorities and the sheriff were trading volleys in the press. Sean Gallagher, the regional head of ICE, blamed the second assault on McFadden. \"I spoke directly to this point late last year and warned that the noncooperation policy would result in preventable crimes of violence taking place in Mecklenburg County,\" he said. \"Sadly, but predictably, this has now taken place.\" The U.S. attorney said McFadden was making the county less safe and warned that someone would die. Local Republican politicians called on McFadden to resign. His predecessor, an erstwhile family friend, told me McFadden has made the community less safe.\n\nFor McFadden, the matter was simple : He believes detainers violate the Constitution, because they ask sheriffs to hold people, without probable cause, who have met a judge's conditions for release. Because Pineda-Ancheta had crossed the border illegally after being deported, he had committed a felony, but McFadden said the sheriff's office was never notified of the felony violation.\n\n\"All I'm asking ICE to do is this: Bring me a criminal warrant, and I'll hold anybody for you,\" McFadden told me on May 29. \"I have 400-plus federal inmates in my detention center right now. You bring me that paper, I got a place to put them. Other than that, you're gonna fight with me the whole time.\"\n\nEven as the political battle raged, the quotidian work of law enforcement and interagency cooperation continued. On June 2, ICE arrested Pineda-Ancheta, and he was charged with illegal reentry . Federal officials sent him to be locked him up in the same place they send most suspects they arrest in the area: McFadden's Mecklenburg County detention center.\n\nThe tale of Luis Pineda-Ancheta is more than a lurid vignette from the national debate over illegal immigration. For centuries, sheriffs reigned as the most powerful county officials throughout the majority of the United States. Part lawman and part mayor, the sheriff was not appointed by other elected officials, but instead derived his authority from voters themselves. The sheriff was the law, and sometimes acted above it, secure in the knowledge that few people could call him to account, and that even fewer would.\n\nThis was especially true in the South, which had few big-city governments or urban police chiefs to siphon off the sheriff's power, and where local control was a watchword. Lawmen such as Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas County, Alabama , whose posse beat marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday, or Sheriff Willis McCall of Lake County, Florida, who shot and killed black prisoners, used their power and autonomy to enforce white supremacy, and to fight against the civil-rights movement.\n\nNow a wave of newly elected sheriffs in urban counties in North Carolina is seeking to employ those same considerable powers. Once again, race is a central factor: The sheriffs are African American, and they campaigned on the promise that they would limit cooperation with ICE. That stance is controversial within North Carolina and around the country, but under federal law such cooperation is voluntary-and the sheriffs won popular mandates, sometimes by huge margins. They took office looking to assert the same local control that their predecessors exercised for generations, but in the service of a progressive and multiracial agenda rather than a white and conservative one.\n\nRead: The end of the David Clarke era\n\nThat proved too much for the state's Republicans. The GOP-led state legislature quickly moved to pass a bill that would require sheriffs to honor ICE detainers. Though the bill now seems unlikely to make it into law-Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has indicated he opposes it-it drew the support of the powerful North Carolina Sheriffs' Association, which has in the past jealously defended its members' prerogatives.\n\nNorth Carolina's progressive cities are ringed by more conservative suburbs and rural areas. That contrast is becoming common across the South, where it is spawning fights over local control and state preemption . The early rounds of those bouts-on issues ranging from voting rights to transgender bathrooms, and now to sheriffs and immigration-have often been fought in North Carolina. At stake isn't just the enforcement of immigration law, but a much bigger question: Will the nation's diverse, growing urban centers be held in check by more conservative rural voters, or will they be allowed to go their own way?\n\n\"If I had known it was this fun, I would have done it years ago,\" McFadden told me with a wide grin in the midst of the Pineda-Ancheta saga. You might have a different idea of fun than McFadden, who spent 38 years at CMPD, many of them as a homicide detective.\n\nIn late 2017, McFadden decided to run against Sheriff Irwin Carmichael. Carmichael, like previous Mecklenburg County sheriffs, had worked closely with ICE. Running on a platform centered on immigration, McFadden routed the conservative Democrat in the primary, effectively guaranteeing he'd be the next sheriff.\n\nIn November, the state's seven biggest counties all elected African American sheriffs, most of them turning out white incumbents. In Forsyth County, home to Winston-Salem, voters chose Bobby Kimbrough, a lanky former DEA agent. In Asheville's Buncombe County, which is fewer than 7 percent black, voters elected Quentin Miller, a tall, soft-spoken career cop who skewers traditional police pieties. In Durham County, a two-term Democrat was driven from office by Clarence Birkhead, the polished former head of the Duke University police department with a habit of quoting Sir Robert Peel, the father of modern policing. In Wake County-home to Raleigh, the state capital-Gerald Baker shocked the 16-year Republican sheriff, and in Greensboro's Guilford County, Danny Rogers did the same to the 24-year GOP incumbent.\n\nThe North Carolina Sheriffs' Association has traditionally been one of the state's most powerful lobbies, favoring a conservative brand of law-and-order politics. But these seven sheriffs ran on progressive platforms, with changing the approach to immigration and jail conditions the most common issues.\n\nNone of them has generated nearly as much praise as McFadden, nor as much criticism. That is partly because Mecklenburg is the state's largest county, partly because of how aggressive McFadden has been in his plans to overhaul the office, and partly a testament to his own outsize personality and eagerness to spar with critics.\n\nTo get a mental image of McFadden, imagine the stereotypical sheriff-a taciturn white guy, sporting a crisply starched uniform, neatly cropped hair, and maybe a broad-brimmed hat-and then erase that entirely. McFadden's preference is for Italian suits (a dark-blue check on the day I visited), sharp shoes (light-brown double monks), colorful ties (purple paisley), and an enormous HOMICIDE DETECTIVE ring. The weather was steamy hot, and McFadden had taken off his jacket but wore a vest. He didn't carry his gun. He speaks, at great length, in an it-ought-to-be-impossible hybrid of clipped cop speech and marble-mouthed country drawl.\n\nCivil rights is in McFadden's blood-his relatives were involved in Briggs v. Elliott , one of the school-segregation cases that was combined into the Brown v. Board of Education decision-but his career in law enforcement was a surprise. His earliest memory of the police is being hassled by a white state trooper in his native South Carolina. But McFadden also met Stanley LeGrant, a black sheriff's deputy whose example stuck with him, and whose picture now adorns his office, alongside a collection of African art. The stubbornness and willingness to speak his mind that have defined his tenure as sheriff were present at the start of his career. After college, he was one of several black applicants to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department.\n\n\"They rejected four of us, and I didn't take the rejection well, and I got back and talked about it, and they hired me,\" McFadden said.\n\nMcFadden thrived inside CMPD, eventually becoming a homicide detective, using his gregariousness as a central tool for his police work. He starred in a documentary series, I Am Homicide , on the Investigation Discovery Channel. In 2011 he retired and was promptly rehired to work with the police chief's office. By the time he ran for sheriff, he was a local celebrity.\n\nMcFadden's larger-than-life personality and ability to connect with people, honed on the homicide beat, made him a natural retail politician. A walk from his office to the detention center, directly across the street, took half an hour. First, there was a bull session with his executive assistant on the way out, then a good-natured joshing for a local defense attorney, conversations with a half-dozen corrections officers, and an impromptu reunion with his old homicide partner.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a setup, but as the encounters stretched over several hours, that became a logistical impossibility. McFadden really seemed to know everyone we met, from magistrates to cleaning ladies, and he had inside jokes to share with many of them. When we finally made it inside the detention center, McFadden stopped so often to talk with guards and residents-as he has relabeled inmates-that the major assigned to lead the tour adopted a tone of mock exasperation that seemed to occasionally shade into genuine impatience.\n\nIt took more than his natural gregariousness to put McFadden in office. The relationship between community activists and police in Charlotte is sometimes adversarial, as it is in so many cities. Activists had been lobbying Carmichael to end 287(g) for years, but while they found that the sheriff was always cordial, they also found him unpersuadable. So they backed McFadden.\n\nThey held rallies and went door-to-door, and the American Civil Liberties Union, in an unusual foray into electoral politics , ran ads on local radio shows assailing the incumbent. \"Sheriff Carmichael works with Trump's deportation force-detaining people for deportation, tearing families apart,\" the ads said. \"Carmichael's challengers? They've pledged to stop working with Trump's deportation force.\" The ACLU's spending helped offset Carmichael's substantial fundraising advantage.\n\n\"We beat him and beat him for months,\" says Robert Dawkins, an organizer with the SAFE Coalition. Then McFadden beat him at the polls.\n\nAdvocacy groups have helped elect progressive sheriffs across the country in recent years. Immigrant and criminal-justice-reform groups harried Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, who oversaw horrific jail conditions and worked closely with ICE, from office, then helped defeat his protégé and successor in August 2018. In Harris County, Texas, the Latino Democrat Ed Gonzalez defeated a Republican incumbent in 2016. And in North Carolina, advocacy groups worked to elect Baker, who promised to end Wake County's 287(g) program, and Birkhead, Miller, and Kimbrough, whose counties didn't participate in 287(g) but who vowed to stop honoring detainers. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors lower levels of immigration, there are now more than 130 broadly defined \"sanctuary counties\" in the United States, out of the more than 3,000 total counties.\n\nThe alliance between activists, reformist sheriffs, and would-be sheriffs is improbable. On one side is an office that embodies the mighty power of law enforcement. On the other are activist groups that are leery of police. But with Donald Trump in the White House, any progress on immigration in Washington seems impossible, and criminal-justice reform often has the greatest impact when achieved at the state and local level.\n\nProgressives have already begun a movement to hold district attorneys to public account and, when possible, replace them. That's another strange fit, because prosecutors are typically law-and-order types, but progressives have scored prominent victories in places such as Philadelphia, with Larry Krasner, and Durham, with Satana Deberry-nontraditional candidates who have overhauled what crimes their offices charge, what bonds they request, and what sentences they seek.\n\nRead: Meet the rogue sheriffs who won't enforce Obama's gun proposals\n\nSheriff accountability is the next front, even though sheriffs tend to be even more politically and institutionally conservative than prosecutors. In recent years, many conservative sheriffs have made national headlines, led by Joe Arpaio, former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, and Clarke, both of whom are close allies of President Trump. (Trump pardoned Arpaio after a conviction of criminal contempt of court, and considered Clarke for several administration jobs.) Calling themselves \"constitutional sheriffs,\" right-wing lawmen have used the office to try to enforce federal immigration laws when they feel Washington is falling down on the job, and they have resisted stricter gun controls, among other moves. While there are liberal sheriffs, such as Tom Dart of Cook County, Illinois , they are exceptions. Sheriffs are 95 percent white and 99 percent male, according to a 2015 study by Emily Farris and Mirya Holman.\n\nThe office of the sheriff is among our more ancient inheritances from the English legal system, pre-dating even the Norman Conquest-kings appointed shire-reeves to act as their delegates in counties, collecting taxes and enforcing laws. In 1634, Northampton County, Virginia, appointed the New World's first sheriff, and 18 years later, it made the job elective . Nearly every state has sheriffs, and in most states the office is written into the state constitution as the highest elective office in any county. In some states, a coroner is the only official who can arrest a lawbreaking sheriff.\n\nThis may sound like arcane history, but in the minds of many sheriffs, it is neither academic nor remote. When then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in 2018 that \"the office of sheriff is a critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement,\" some liberal critics were quick to denounce the remarks as racist. McFadden, though, proudly thrust a printout of Sessions's speech at me to underscore the significance of his office.\n\nUnlike local police, who are typically hired by city and town governments chartered by the state, sheriffs derive their power directly from the state constitution. No conversation with a sheriff lasts long before he points out that he runs an \"office,\" not a \"department,\" underscoring its autonomy. Sheriffs may depend on county government for funding-though many have their own revenue streams, such as fees for gun permitting-but they answer only to voters.\n\nIn practice, though, voters have rarely asked their sheriffs to answer for very much. Casey LaFrance, an associate professor at Western Illinois University and a former deputy sheriff, told me that many sheriffs serve three or four terms. Jobs often pass from a longtime sheriff to a hand-picked protégé-maybe even a son. Since 1931, three generations of the same family have served as sheriff of Pickaway County, Ohio, save one four-year gap.\n\nBut the job has changed dramatically. North Carolina gave American popular culture its most enduring image of a sheriff: the kindly, hands-on Andy Taylor on The Andy Griffith Show , set in a fictionalized version of Griffith's own hometown of Mount Airy. The life of a contemporary rural sheriff might bear some similarities to Taylor's, but a big-city sheriff has more in common with a chief executive officer than a small-town cop. While Sheriff Taylor had only Barney Fife as a deputy, the Mecklenburg County sheriff's office employs more than 1,000 people and oversees a budget of about $120 million. Urban sheriffs typically leave policing the streets to city departments, and instead handle issues such as gun permits, evictions, and especially jails. The Mecklenburg County detention center can house nearly 3,000 people.\n\nExtensive attention has been paid to prisons in recent years, but many more Americans pass through jails on an annual basis-some 10 million in 2017 alone. Many people spend weeks, months, or even years in pretrial detention without ever being convicted, simply because they cannot pay a bond. That has produced a growing backlash against the cash-bail system . Jails are also on the front lines of dealing with people with mental illnesses and drug addictions.\n\nRead: The new local frontier of criminal-justice reform\n\nSeveral of the new sheriffs are focused on jail conditions, and would prefer to talk about that than immigration. Birkhead has launched a review of how his jail functions, after nine deaths under his predecessor . Miller has created real-time dashboards to share information with the public about the jail population and, recognizing the number of addicted and mentally ill people who pass through the jail, is designing a medically assisted therapy program to treat them inside and find them support systems when they leave.\n\nMecklenburg-detention-center visits had been limited to video, but McFadden restored in-person visitation and is redecorating a room in nursery style for children to make in-contact visits with incarcerated parents. He launched a detention-center job fair to help residents find employment after their release. (In keeping with his own sartorial sense, he also overhauled a closet holding interview clothing for residents, which he has had replenished with more stylish duds and christened the \"Fourth Street Haberdashery,\" after the jail's address.) McFadden told me he tries to visit the detention center every day.\n\nBut because of its political salience, the fight over immigration has tended to eclipse these efforts. Big-city sheriffs wield great power over the enforcement of immigration laws because of their jails. Sheriffs lean right overall, but especially on immigration. Holman and Farris have found that while sheriffs tend to be responsive to local political pressures on some issues, they put their personal views about immigrants and immigration policy ahead of their constituents' preferences. Sheriffs say federal officials strongly influence their attitude toward immigration enforcement, while local police chiefs express more concern about maintaining good relations with the immigrant communities they police. Dan Thompson, a graduate student at Stanford, has found that Democratic sheriffs cooperate with ICE at almost the same rate as Republican sheriffs.\n\nCooperation takes a few forms. ICE works to identify immigrants here illegally through NCIC and by sending officers to jails to screen for them. If the agency identifies people who have been arrested for local criminal charges who it believes are deportable, it can issue detainers to a sheriff's office. About 75 sheriff's offices around the country have 287(g) arrangements with ICE, which trains officers and deputies to inquire about arrestees' immigration status and place detainers on them. Because ICE has limited staffing to check jails, 287(g) allows it to catch people who might otherwise slip through its grasp.\n\nFor most of American history, immigration enforcement was a largely federal matter. Local governments were neither empowered nor eager to enforce federal laws. That began to change in the mid-1990s, amid public backlash against illegal immigration. Congress created 287(g) in 1996, but it was little used until after 9/11, when President George W. Bush created the Department of Homeland Security, including ICE, and federal, state, and local agencies began working together more closely.\n\nMeanwhile, public anger over illegal immigration continued to grow. In 2005 and 2006, a strict immigration bill died in the Senate, but not before inspiring some of the largest protests in American history. The marches were a crystallizing moment for Latino political power, but they also drew a major backlash among white voters, Helen Marrow, a sociologist at Tufts, told me-especially in nontraditional immigrant destinations, such as smaller cities whose numbers of immigrants were small, but growing quickly. State legislatures, especially across the South, began to pursue harsh anti-illegal-immigration bills, such as Arizona's 2010 \"show me your papers\" law .\n\nIn Charlotte, then- Sheriff Jim Pendergraph realized 287(g) could be a powerful tool against immigrants here illegally. While the program had mostly focused on violent criminals, Pendergraph directed deputies to screen for civil violations of immigration law, which fed more immigrants into the deportation system. Pendergraph was soon hired by ICE; in 2008, he told a conference of police chiefs and sheriffs , \"If you don't have enough evidence to charge someone criminally but you think he's illegal, we can make him disappear.\"\n\nNorth Carolina became the epicenter of 287(g), with more programs than any other state. One especially vocal participant was Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson, who styled himself after Arpaio's methods and rhetoric, and whom the Obama Justice Department unsuccessfully sued for the racial profiling of Latinos.\n\nThe relationship between federal and local law enforcement grew even closer during the Obama administration. In 2011, the federal government turned Secure Communities, a Bush-era pilot, into a mandatory national program, creating a direct link between local police and the federal immigration system. Secure Communities is one reason Barack Obama deported more people than any other president, but it was eventually scaled drastically back due to concerns about racial profiling. Some sheriffs and counties also bridled at being forced to enforce federal law, especially without substantial funding from the federal government.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected, many sheriffs were pleased to have an administration in place that would encourage them to enforce federal immigration laws. Enrollment in 287(g), which had dropped, shot back up. But progressive activists, recognizing that they would be shut out at the federal level for the foreseeable future, began to focus their energy on projects such as sheriff accountability-echoing a broader shift toward local legislation on the left .\n\nAfrican American political power was crucial to the success of this movement. The 2006 Latino marches galvanized white voters against immigration, but that white backlash in turn galvanized African Americans in the South. There hadn't been a close political connection between Latino and black communities across the region before, Marrow told me, but African American leaders recognized a parallel between racist policing in their own community and the harsh new policing and surveillance of immigrant communities.\n\n\"I've made this comparison-and people even in the African American community get mad at me sometimes-I compare 287(g) to the Fugitive Slave Act,\" Dawkins says. \"If you made it up north, you are free, but the federal government came up with an act that said, You can go across the border to the Northern states, deport them back to the South, and put them into bondage . To me, that's the spirit of 287(g).\"\n\nIt's not a coincidence that the coalition of groups that has focused on sheriff accountability in North Carolina speaks the language of intersectionality and includes predominantly black, Latino, and LGBTQ groups. Despite their alliance of convenience, both the new sheriffs and these groups acknowledge the inherent tension among their goals. While they may agree on some policies, they arrive there from very different angles. Many of the activists favor abolition of jails and the police altogether. Activists are conscious of the difficulties the new sheriffs face, but that doesn't mean they're willing to give them a pass. Forward Justice, a Durham-based group, gave Birkhead a report card on his first 100 days with grades ranging from A to D.\n\n\"Birkhead has taken on a pretty challenging project,\" says Sendolo Diaminah, an organizer in Durham. \"Sheriffs' offices, especially in the South, have a very long racist and class-driven history. He's thrown himself into the middle of that and said he would reform it. We want to transform it.\"\n\nThat difference in perspective is clear from the way people talk about ICE. Activist groups tend to view noncooperation with ICE as a moral duty to ensure social justice for immigrant communities. The cops, being cops, frame their stance differently. First, they point first to the importance of local control, as mediated by the ballot box. They ran on the promise to end 287(g) programs and detainers, and the citizens of their counties elected them. Doing anything else would betray the voters' trust.\n\n\"One of the things that I understand is that each county has its own personality,\" Kimbrough told me. \"Each county across the country is different. The men and woman that have been elected in those counties do what is right for their county-right, moral, and legal.\"\n\nSecond, they say they're just protecting public safety, because mixing immigration and local law enforcement creates distrust between Latino communities and the police. McFadden said that a \"stop snitching\" ethos was a major problem when he worked murder cases: Witnesses would acknowledge they knew what happened but would refuse to tell him. Getting people to speak when immigrant communities are worried about deportation is difficult, he said. As academics who study the interaction between police and immigrants have documented , victims don't call the police or file complaints and witnesses slip into the woodwork.\n\n\"I'll be shot, I'll be beat up, I'll be robbed, and I won't be a victim, because I'm afraid of law enforcement, afraid of the policía ,\" McFadden said. \"That was a huge barrier for me as a detective. Anybody can say what they want. I experienced it firsthand for three decades.\"\n\nThird, sheriffs argue not only that they're on solid legal ground by declining to participate in voluntary programs, but that they'd risk violating the Constitution by cooperating. Once an arrestee meets court-determined conditions for release, the sheriff releases them. An ICE detainer asks a sheriff to hold a suspect longer, and the administrative warrant that accompanies it is signed by an ICE officer, not a judge. The sheriffs say that may violate the Fourth Amendment, pointing to a decision in the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes North Carolina.\n\n\"To ask a law-enforcement officer to detain someone for up to 48 hours without basing that detention on probable cause amounts to a new arrest,\" Birkhead told me. \"Every arrest that I've ever participated in in my 30-plus years of law enforcement must be based on probable cause. To me it's unlawful.\"\n\nAdvocates say that ICE often makes mistakes in the process, too-for example, confusing people with similar names. Many people who have been wrongly detained sue, and local sheriff's offices and counties, which is to say local taxpayers and voters, end up footing the bill .\n\nThe solution, according to the detainer-rejecting sheriffs, is simple. They want ICE to go before a judge and get a warrant, rather than offer a civil request. That creates additional work for ICE, but Kimbrough, who worked for more than 20 years in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, says it's not too much to ask.\n\n\"I can literally hit my 8-iron from the magistrate office to the U.S. court. Literally a pitching wedge,\" he said. \"That's where the office of ICE is located. If you really want a man that bad, you can get a signature in two hours.\"\n\nHe bristles at the idea that sheriffs aren't working with ICE, and said he's on a first-name basis with the federal agents in Forsyth County. \"I wouldn't thumb my nose at the feds. I know the power of the federal government. I once was the federal government! I know the wrath of the federal government,\" Kimbrough said. \"I don't do politics. I do what is right.\"\n\nRead: America's largest mental hospital is a jail\n\nCarmichael, the former Mecklenburg County sheriff, says the demand for a warrant is foolhardy.\n\n\"Why do you make ICE jump through more hoops?\" he says. \"Why do you not want to know who's in your community? You should cooperate with them. I want to know, for the safety of my officers, who they're dealing with, and for the safety of the community.\"\n\nMoreover, Bryan Cox, a regional spokesman for ICE, notes that because a first illegal crossing is a civil violation, ICE cannot obtain a criminal warrant unless someone has already been deported once.\n\n\"They are asking for something that literally is impossible. They are asking for something that does not exist under federal law,\" Cox says. \"Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, passed by Congress, immigration is civil law. Basically, what they're saying is: Federal law on the criminal side of the house, they honor, but anything to do with civil and administrative law, they do not honor.\"\n\nHe says that if sheriffs are unwilling to honor detainers, ICE would prefer that they inform the agency when they release people so that ICE can arrest them outside the jail, as some sheriffs who do not honor detainers do. If they don't, Cox says, ICE will still seek to arrest unauthorized immigrants, just as it did with Pineda-Ancheta, and he says those arrests can actually result in more of the kinds of tense encounters between immigrants and law enforcement that McFadden says are so harmful.\n\n\"If ICE is not able to take custody of that person at the local jail, ICE is sworn to enforce federal immigration law, with or without local cooperation,\" Cox says. \"ICE has no choice but to send officers into the community to search for that criminal target. That has a direct effect of increasing ICE's presence in the local community, not reducing it.\"\n\nIn any case, ICE has not begun seeking warrants. Instead, the agency has continued submitting detainers, which sheriffs have ignored. Birkhead said he has invited ICE to meet, but has been ignored himself. ICE and the sheriffs are now locked in a highly unusual public feud. It began the night that McFadden won his primary, with ICE warning that if he followed through on his promise to withdraw from 287(g), the agency would have no choice but to increase immigration raids around Charlotte. When McFadden went through with the withdrawal, ICE did ramp up raids, but it couldn't force him to stay in the program. To him, that demonstrated the impressive power of the sheriff's office.\n\n\"The federal government knows that I have the power to say no. You can blast me in the media and you can create other things, but all I have to say is, I'm not participating in this voluntary program ,\" McFadden told me. \"That's why it's so important that we know the power of the sheriffs. I can change people's life by a decision I make. I can make that decision, and I don't have to ask anybody to make that decision.\"\n\nState legislators had other ideas. In March, Republicans in the North Carolina House of Representatives filed a bill that would force sheriffs to honor ICE detainers. Those who don't comply could be removed from office.\n\n\"At the end of the day, this is about public safety-it's as simple as that,\" Representative Destin Hall, one of the bill's primary sponsors, said at a hearing in April . \"These sanctuary sheriffs are simply putting partisan politics ahead of public safety. That's the reality, can't escape it.\"\n\nRather than being simple, however, the bill, styled H.B. 370, is a Frankenstein's monster of federalism: state legislators telling county officials to comply with federal law as interpreted by a state magistrate. The bill requires that state magistrates review detainers. In theory, that relieves sheriffs of decision-making power. But Susanna Birdsong, an attorney with the ACLU of North Carolina, told me that magistrates-who aren't required to have law degrees-aren't equipped to interpret federal law, meaning they'll serve as a rubber stamp. Nor will the work-around protect sheriffs' offices from civil liability if there's a wrongful detention, Birdsong said.\n\nRead: When the old sheriff leaves town\n\nAfter opposing an earlier draft of the bill, the NCSA gave the current version a strong endorsement, but Birkhead, McFadden, Miller, and Kimbrough all told me they oppose the bill, and Danny Rogers told the Greensboro News & Record he does too. Miller worries the NCSA is failing to recognize an attack on the powers of the sheriff. Politics aside, surrender on this bill will only invite legislators to further erode sheriffs' powers in the future, he said.\n\nOne reason the NCSA ended up backing the bill is simple math: Although the black sheriffs of the seven biggest counties represent nearly 4 million of the state's 10 million residents, there are 100 counties, many of them more rural and conservative, and each with its own sheriff. The Old North State has seen a long battle over local power in recent years, as the state's liberal cities try to push through local policies and the state legislature, dominated by rural conservatives, enacts laws that preempt their authority . (Preemption battles cut both ways: In 2017, Democrats in California passed a law limiting local-law-enforcement cooperation with ICE , which drew protests from conservative sheriffs, police, and communities, and has been challenged in court.) Inevitably, those preemption battles have taken on a racial dimension, given the large nonwhite populations in cities.\n\n\"I'm new to being a sheriff, but I'm not new to being a man of color,\" Miller said. \"If you can't see what this is about, I can't help you.\"\n\nWith Republicans in control of both houses of the General Assembly, and with the NCSA backing the bill, its passage was basically assured. But on June 20, Baker, McFadden, and Miller visited the General Assembly for one last push against the bill. Speaking alongside Democratic lawmakers, and with a crowd of immigrant advocates looking on, they delivered their well-rehearsed case against the bill.\n\nThe sheriffs were still agitated, but they didn't have any illusions about persuading the Senate. This was a battle to capture Cooper and public opinion. The governor had long held his tongue about the bill, conscious of the political danger: Veto it and risk being seen as soft on crime; sign it and risk a furious backlash from the progressive groups and urban, liberal voters he needed to win reelection next year.\n\n\"H.B. 370 is not about protecting our community,\" McFadden told a huge battery of cameras. \"The House bill clearly is about attacking a select group of sheriffs who now have been carefully identified by using code words such as urban sheriffs , sanctuary sheriffs , and the one that I heard in this House that was more disturbing than anything else, the super minority-majority sheriffs , simply meaning to me the newly elected African American sheriffs of the seven largest counties in North Carolina.\"\n\nThe anti-detainer sheriffs said they'd follow the law if it passed. But if ICE detainers violate the Constitution, as they contend, and not honoring detainers becomes a violation of state law, it remains unclear what they actually will do.\n\nLater that afternoon, the Senate Judiciary Committee met in a packed hearing room to approve the bill. Outside, sergeants-at-arms tried to corral an overflow crowd. Inside, a nervous energy tingled, with legislators, sheriffs, the press, and bystanders all girding for the confrontation to come. After eight years of GOP control in Raleigh, the routine for these hearings is familiar: Republicans introduce the legislation, Democrats raise a series of objections, and Republicans cordially but tersely dismiss them. Members of the public speak briefly, and then the Republicans vote to move the bill forward.\n\nDuring the public comments, McFadden and Baker once against lashed out at lawmakers for grandstanding and refusing to meet. A woman who identified herself as an unauthorized immigrant spoke through a translator, calling the bill \"racist and unconstitutional.\" Then Representative Brenden Jones, one of the bill's primary sponsors, spoke, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\"Do you see 100 sheriffs back here? Must be a pretty good idea then,\" he said. \"We've got three or four. This is commonsense legislation that has been thrust upon us by a few that refuse what they're supposed to do. This is going to make these guys do what's right for the citizens of North Carolina.\"\n\nMcFadden and Baker stalked out. Immigrant activists shouted at the lawmakers as sergeants-at-arms hauled them away. The committee voted to move the bill along, but tension remained: As the meeting dispersed, several legislators got into a heated argument in the back of the room. I found an agitated, wide-eyed McFadden in the lobby.\n\n\"Wooooooow. Wooooooow,\" he said. \"That was as racist as hell. Wooooooow!\"\n\nH.B. 370 passed the Senate on June 24, and the House and Senate versions still have to be reconciled. But hours before the Senate vote, Cooper announced his opposition to the bill. Because voters ended Republican supermajorities in the General Assembly in November, when they also elected the sheriffs, Cooper's veto would likely be sustained. \"As the former top law-enforcement officer in our state, I know that current law allows us to lock up and prosecute dangerous criminals regardless of immigration status,\" Cooper said in a statement. \"This bill isn't about that-in addition to being unconstitutional, it's about scoring political points and using fear to divide us.\"\n\nIt's common for politicians to dismiss their opponents' measures as mere point-scoring. But writing off politics as the dirty underbelly of governance, as Cooper did, misses a bigger point. Politics gave Republicans a supermajority and then took it away. Politics elected Irwin Carmichael and then Garry McFadden. And politics is the way voters decide what sort of policies they want from their sheriff-at least for now.\n\nThis article is part of our project \"The Presence of Justice,\" which is supported by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T.

      "text": "The Anti-Trump Recoil Goes Too Far\n\nThe overheated reaction to comments by Jeff Sessions dramatizes the need for a backlash that restores moderation-not one that swings the pendulum to the opposite extreme.\n\nIn the winter of 1858, Abraham Lincoln answered an admirer seeking advice on the study of law. Where should a beginner start? Lincoln replied by citing a basic library of works by four authors. Two were American; two were English. Lincoln did not assert an \"Anglo-American legal tradition.\" He took it for granted, as has every American lawyer and judge before and since.\n\nSuch basic concepts as \"torts\" and \"felonies\" are English-other legal systems are organized quite differently. The conception of the judge as a disengaged regulator of a trial, rather than an active participant in it, is English too. Not only sheriffs, but also bailiffs and grand juries originated in England. U.S. constitutional law is derived from Great Britain: The \"cruel and unusual punishments\" clause of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution is reproduced verbatim from England's 1689 Bill of Rights. *\n\nAs a reader of The Atlantic , you surely already know all this. I would fear that I'm wasting your time by repeating these basics of American history-if we had not just emerged from a 36-hour social-media rage-spasm against Attorney General Jeff Sessions for merely referencing these incontrovertible and familiar facts. \"The office of sheriff is a critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement,\" Sessions said in a speech.\n\n\"Do you know anyone who says 'Anglo-American heritage' in a sentence?\" Senator Brian Schatz tweeted in response. \"What could possibly be the purpose of saying that other than to pit Americans against each other? For the chief law enforcement officer to use a dog whistle like that is appalling.\" That storm has subsided, as social-media storms so often do. I sense that some of the participants now feel a little sheepish about the whole thing. But maybe it's worth talking about it a little longer, because there are some authentically valuable lessons to be learned from the episode.\n\nOne of the great positives of the Trump presidency is the way that it has forced a confrontation with wrongs and evils too often shrugged off. The overwhelming visibility of President Trump has projected his lifelong cruelties and brutalities onto the world's hugest Jumbotron for all to see-and from that sight, millions of decent Americans have decently recoiled.\n\nBut if the recoil is powerful enough, it can propel those feeling the recoil to extremes where they would never have voluntarily traveled. Taking offense at mention of the Anglo-American legal heritage is merely absurd. For Conan O'Brian to rebuke Trump's \"shithole\" comments by posing with a tropical drink in the aquamarine water of a Haitian resort is to pass from the absurd to the insensitively cruel. Fewer than half of Haitians have reliable access to water, the World Bank reports ; almost 10,000 have died of cholera since 2010.\n\nAnd the worst of the anti-Trump political reactions may wait ahead. In reaction to Trump, many Democrats are speaking as if immigration enforcement is inherently immoral, as if every Trump voter is a deplorable racist, as if the proper response to Trump's ethnic chauvinism is an equal and opposite counter-chauvinism.\n\nThe most hopeful possible outcome of the Trump presidency would be that it jolts America to its better self-that it reaffirms democratic norms, recalls Americans to civility and character, and reinvigorates the political center. The most dangerous alternative outcome would be that Trump's pendulum swing to one kind of illiberal extreme generates momentum for an extreme swing in the opposite direction. Speaking of Britain, we've seen in the United Kingdom that anti-system political energy has flowed toward Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party, flecked by anti-Semitism. In Germany and Italy, the ultra-left has grown in tandem with the far right. It could happen here too. It may be happening here too.\n\nIt's a supremely important question for the future whether anti-Trump energies restore moderation-or instead inspire counter-radicalization. The overheated reaction to the Sessions non-gaffe demonstrated how the question can be answered wrong. Deep breaths and calmer second thoughts, please.\n\n* This article originally stated that the \"cruel and unusual punishments\" clause was in the Fifth Amendment. We regret the error."

      "text": "'The Most Expensive Sheriff in America' Is Getting More Expensive\n\nAnother multi-million-dollar bill comes due this year for Sheriff Joe Arpaio's reckless antics in Maricopa County, Arizona. And that's why more taxpayers may finally be asking: Who keeps voting for this guy, anyway?\n\nIt's another year in paradise for the taxpayers of Maricopa County, Arizona, home of America's most famous sheriff, Joe Arpaio. On New Year's Day, The Arizona Republic reported that Sheriff Joe's unconstitutional antics over the years-the systemic racial profiling chronicled so meticulously last May by a federal judge, for example-has cost his constituents another $21.9 million.  That's on top of the tens of millions in other legal fees and penalties Arpaio already has cost the good people of his county during his 22-year reign there. From The Republic :\n\nThe $21.9 million estimate includes several big-ticket items:\n\nSalaries and employee benefits to launch a seven-member unit to implement changes recommended by the court order, plus five vehicles, six computers, supplies and fuel for the unit.\n\nAn electronic data-entry system, cameras for all patrol vehicles, and training for deputies to use the system to input data detailing the reasons for and lengths of their traffic stops.\n\nSalaries and benefits for enough new supervisors to assure \"effective supervision\" for patrol deputies. No more than 12 deputies will be assigned to each supervisor, per the court order. The county will pay for seven additional sergeants, three additional deputies, and all their equipment, stun guns and radios.\n\nAfter fiscal 2015, additional changes ordered by the court will cost an estimated $10 million annually, mainly in salaries, benefits and overtime hours for additional staff.\n\nIn other words, as The Republic reports, by consistently and flagrantly violating the constitutional rights of his constituents, Arpaio has brought upon those constituents a level of federal oversight that is entirely unnecessary for hundreds of other sheriffs in Arizona and elsewhere. Sheriff Joe rails against this federal intrusion upon his county's autonomy-- a court-ordered monitor now is at hand -- even as his colleagues in office scramble to comply with their legal obligations. He plays the victim-the embattled symbol of sensible enforcement-while the people he is supposed to protect are the ones who have to pay his bill.\n\nAnd now come PR-infused rumors that Arpaio is urging the actor Steven Seagal to run for governor. They are a perfect pair, aren't they? An actor who built his career on a film called Above the Law and a lawman long documented to be among the most lawless in the nation. They truly deserve to waste each other's time. The only problem is that while the earnest voters of the state, if given the choice, may never elect Seagal, the earnest voters of Maricopa County keep sending Arpaio back on the job- he's been reelected six times since 1992 , even after the worst civil rights allegations against him were proven true.\n\nThere is some evidence, however, that as the year begins and the toll mounts, local sentiment may at last be turning away from Arpaio's costly and divisive brand of law enforcement. The editorial board of the Republic , no bastion of weak-kneed liberalism, published a pitch-perfect piece last Thursday that frames the issue in a way that precludes the sheriff's supporters-the silent majority that has supported him through thick and thin-from continuing to justify the extraordinary costs of his tenure. From the house editorial, titled \"Joe Arpaio, America's Most Expensive Sheriff\":\n\nEvery extra dollar the county appropriates to comply with the court's ruling is a dollar unavailable for other county services. That is one affront Arpaio should not be allowed.\n\nTo date, he has had to pay nothing for his abuses. Thomas was disbarred and former Chief Deputy David Henderschott lost his job. Innocents caught in his crime sweeps were handcuffed, detained and had to hire attorneys. Fear spread through entire communities. Public officials targeted for nonexistent corruption lived through hell.\n\nThrough it all, Arpaio remained in office. Fans lined up to get autographed pink boxers. Candidates clamored for his endorsement.\n\nUnbelievable. Arpaio is a burden on the taxpayer, needlessly costing this county tens of millions of dollars. This is money that would be put to much better uses if he just stuck to what other Arizona sheriffs do: patrol their counties and enforce the law. It doesn't sell books, but it keeps communities safe.\n\nThere is no good answer to this argument. Arpaio's transgressions are forcing his constituents to rack up these unnecessary bills at the expense of policies and practices that are best suited to protect them. The taxpayers of this county, put another way, are paying an exorbitant premium for the privilege of having Sheriff Arpaio violate the constitutional rights of their friends and neighbors. Maybe that's something the good people of Maricopa County will ponder this year as they watch the long-anticipated reality series : Steven Seagal, Lawman-Maricopa County . That is, if they can find it on cable. A&E evidently cancelled the show and now it is reportedly appearing on a network called Reelz ."

      "text": "MAGA Institute Honors Sheriffs Who Defy Laws They Don't Like\n\nFormer Senior Researcher\n\nThe MAGA think tank at the vanguard of pro-Trump public intellectuals is recruiting sheriffs with ties to the far right and a dubious devotion to the \"rule of law\" to be academic \"fellows\" as part of a new program launched by the conservative institute this week.\n\nThe Claremont Institute, a far-right research group that's home to a number of former Trump administration officials, announced a new crop of eight \"sheriffs fellows\" selected from across the country on the basis of their \"character, aptitude, accomplishments, zeal, and community reputation\" to visit Claremont's California campus and study a syllabus of standard conservative political catechism.\n\nThe coursework , Claremont says, is fairly anodyne-lectures on Locke, the Federalist Papers, and English legal history-but the Institute's choice of students is far more radical. Of the eight fellows announced this week, six have some affiliation with the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA), an organization labeled as an anti-government extremist group by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center for its endorsement of the idea that sheriffs can pick and choose which laws to enforce based on their own personal beliefs about what the Constitution allows.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn that spirit, members of Claremont's first crop of sheriff fellows have vowed not to enforce pandemic restrictions, vaccine mandates, gun laws, and basically any laws they disagree with. For far-right groups like the Claremont Institute, those efforts to sidestep the rule of law and the will of democratically elected governments are a feature, not a bug.\n\n\"There are a growing number of groups who are clinging to the idea of the constitutional sheriff as the way to undermine everything from school board elections to attempts to curtail the pandemic restrictions to Biden administration regulations,\" says Devin Burghart, executive director of the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights in Washington state. \"Claremont is just the most recent example of many of these organizations that are pushing the constitutional sheriff idea as a way to gain power at the local level.\"\n\nIn response to questions from The Daily Beast, a Claremont spokesperson said the institute did not consider affiliation with the CPSOA or the constitutional sheriffs movement in selecting applicants. \"We rarely take institutional positions, and don't do so here, but Sheriffs who revere the Constitution are a good thing,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe constitutional sheriffs movement arose in the 1970s and '80s in the wake of the farm crisis, when plunging land and agricultural commodity prices forced parts of rural America into poverty and swelled the ranks of extremist vigilante movements, says Burghart. In the years since, the idea of a \"constitutional sheriff\" who could nullify federal laws and create \"posses\" of like-minded civilians to stiffen that resistance has grown in times of anti-government sentiment, including the militia movement of the 1990s and the Tea Party of the 2010s.\n\nWhile the constitutional sheriffs movement drew its strength from the backlash to gun-control measures in the 1990s, the current incarnation of the movement is focused on undermining COVID-19 public health restrictions-an issue Claremont's chosen fellows seized on.\n\nSheriff Mark Lamb, for example, is a newly minted sheriff fellow from Arizona's Pinal County and a favorite of both Fox News bookers and former President Trump himself. Lamb, an avowed constitutional sheriff , became a right-wing celebrity when he publicly vowed not to enforce Republican Gov. Doug Ducey's stay at home order in early 2020. Lamb subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 after he was invited to the Trump White House for a press event with law enforcement but the infection hasn't changed his attitude. He's since taken to Fox News to state that he will refuse to enforce any state or federal vaccine mandate.\n\nAs then-President Trump pressured Democratic governors to open their states, many of Lamb's colleagues in Claremont's freshman class of sheriff fellows followed suit with acts of public defiance. When Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a stay-at-home order in April 2020, she earned then-President Trump's wrath and a tweet demanding that residents \"Liberate Michigan.\"\n\nNeither Lamb nor any of the sheriffs fellows responded to requests for comment from The Daily Beast.\n\nKim Cole , a Claremont fellow and sheriff from Mason County, Michigan, who had previously signed a CSPOA letter vowing not to enforce any Obama administration gun control measures, answered the call. He joined with a handful of Michigan sheriffs to vow that they would not enforce the measure.\n\nCulpeper County, Virginia Sheriff and Claremont fellow Scott Jenkins announced a similar response following Trump's call to \"liberate\" Virginia under then Gov. Ralph Northam. Jenkins, a speaker at CSPOA's 2020 conference, said in a Facebook post that he would \"not trample the constitutional freedoms of our citizens to enforce an edict\" of Northam's executive order to close some businesses.\n\nIn the case of Riverside's Sheriff and Claremont fellow Chad Bianco , that casual attitude towards the risks associated with COVID-19 has had dangerous consequences. Like a number of his colleagues, Bianco made a name for himself through Fox News appearances and membership not just in the CSPOA , but in the far-right Oath Keepers militia. In Bianco's case, his public refusal to enforce COVID-19 precautions has spilled over into Riverside's jails , which have experienced \"one of the largest outbreaks of COVID-19 of jails,\" according to the ACLU.\n\nWhile the constitutional sheriffs movement may seem like a handy cudgel against the growth of vaccine and quarantine rules, its most troubling appeal to the MAGA right may lie in an imagined ability to nullify not just laws, but elections.\n\nIn the weeks before the 2020 election, a Claremont working group sketched out a scenario in a report, \"79 Days to Inauguration,\" that reads like a mixture of conservative war game and fan fiction.

      "text": "Sheriffs Buck the Law, Refuse to Enforce Lockdown Orders\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nUnder Washington state's statewide coronavirus stay-at-home order , residents can't go to the barber or work out at the gym. But in Snohomish County-which has seen more than 2,150 cases, including one of the first in the country-Sheriff Adam Fortney says his deputies won't stop people who break the order.\n\n\"Along with other elected Sheriffs around our state, the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office will not be enforcing an order preventing religious freedoms or constitutional rights,\" Fortney wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday.\n\nAlready under pressure from the Trump administration and a national right-wing network of anti-social distancing protesters , governors trying to balance economic and public health interests are facing additional challenges at the local law enforcement level. With his Facebook post, Fortney joined a growing trend of sheriffs across the country who are refusing to enforce stay-at-home orders-and tapping into an extremist anti-government movement that believes that sheriffs are the highest legal authority in the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFour sheriffs in Michigan have refused to enforce the stay-at-home order issued by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and which has become the focus of much of the conservative backlash to social distancing measures. Two Wisconsin sheriffs have said they won't enforce that state's order. And, elsewhere in Washington, Franklin County Sheriff J.D. Raymond issued a letter saying his department wouldn't enforce the order issued by another Democratic governor, Jay Inslee.\n\n\"Neither I nor my office will enforce any arrests or fines regarding the operation of privately owned businesses,\" Raymond wrote .\n\nThe legal foundation for Fortney and the other sheriffs to refuse enforcement of governors' stay-at-home orders are shaky at best. But they have a strong ideological basis on the extremist right's \"Constitutional Sheriff\" movement , where anti-government activists have claimed for decades that sheriffs can ignore laws with which they disagree.\n\n\"The whole thrust of the Constitutional Sheriffs movement is that a sheriff is not beholden to federal authorities, which is completely disproven by federal jurisprudence in any number of cases,\" Howard Graves, a senior researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe idea that elected sheriffs-as opposed to state or federal governments-hold supreme legal power originated in the 1960s and '70s in the \"Posse Comitatus\" movement, which was tied to white supremacist groups, according to Graves.\n\n\"They held that the sheriff was the highest law of the land,\" Graves said.\n\nPosse Comitatus fell from prominence on the extremist right after several cases in which members fired on federal law enforcement officials, including the 1983 murder of two U.S. marshals in North Dakota. But many of its obscure legal theories experienced a renaissance during the Obama administration, when right-wing activists-opposed to the Affordable Care Act and federal land laws and afraid of new gun control measures-became convinced that they could be saved by local elected sheriffs.\n\nThe sheriffs willing to buck federal and state governments during the Obama administration were boosted by right-wing media outlets, including Fox News. Two of the prominent supporters of the so-called Constitutional Sheriffs, former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, became stars on the right, with Arpaio eventually receiving a pardon from Trump after being convicted over racial profiling.\n\n\"Fox News in particular was really prolific in bringing these people on TV and promoting their anti-government rhetoric, and it's the same thing that they're doing now with these protests against quarantine,\" said Graves.\n\nThe Constitutional Sheriffs concept was also embraced by rancher Cliven Bundy, whose family members and supporters led anti-government militia groups in standoffs against law enforcement officials in Nevada and Oregon. In a sign of the leading role played by sheriffs in the anti-government movement, LaVoy Finicum, a participant in the Oregon standoff, was shot by law enforcement officials on his way to meet with a sympathetic sheriff. Finicum has since become a martyr on the extremist right.\n\n\"This guy's final mission was to get to this local sheriff's meeting,\" Graves said.\n\nAmmon Bundy, who led the Oregon standoff, has reinvented himself in the coronavirus era as one of the most outspoken voices on the far right against stay-at-home orders.\n\n\"I think it's notable that Ammon Bundy was an early example of this kind of in-person protest of stay-at-home orders,\" said Lindsay Schubiner, a program director at the Western States Center, a left-leaning group that tracks extremist groups in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMore recently, right-wing activists have turned sheriffs into figures of defiance against gun control laws. In January, new gun control measures from Democratic lawmakers in Virginia prompted sheriffs in the state to say they would refuse to enforce the laws, with one even claiming he would deputize would-be gun owners to get around the law.\n\nIn 2019, self-described Constitutional Sheriffs in Washington, urged on by militia and extremist right-wing groups, refused to enforce a new gun law . Using sheriffs to challenge laws is a part of a broader campaign from extremist groups in the state to foil the state legislature, according to Schubiner.\n\n\"The strategy has also included threats and intimidation directed at public officials and civil servants,\" Schubiner said.\n\nThe reach of the movement has limits outside of the confines of the far right. Arpaio ran a failed campaign for U.S. Senate in Arizona. Clarke was floated for a Trump administration post but those plans were scrapped after swift public backlash. And while some sheriffs have been at the forefront of anti-gun control movements, others have been prominent backers of policies to expand background checks.\n\nIn that same vein, it's not clear yet how significant the refusal of sheriffs to enforce stay-at-home orders will be. Inslee blasted the Washington state sheriffs on Wednesday, saying they didn't have the legal power to refuse to enforce coronavirus orders.\n\n\"We cannot have individual law enforcement officers arbitrarily decide which laws they're going to enforce,\" he said , without specifying what legal powers he could use against the sheriffs. \"Encouraging illegal activity jeopardizes the health of people in our communities.\"\n\nFortney, who didn't respond to a request for comment, appears to be having second thoughts himself. At a Wednesday press conference, the sheriff appeared to walk back his Facebook post, claiming he was not calling for \"open defiance\" and saying he hoped his dispute with Inslee wouldn't end up in court.\n\n\"My Facebook post definitely started some conversation, there's no doubt about it,\" Fortney said.\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nWilliam.Sommer@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "'They're Going to Eat Them': These Rogue Sheriffs Won't Even Give Their Prisoners Masks\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nMore than 1,600 inmates across the U.S. have died from the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, but even that hasn't stopped some sheriffs from flagrantly flouting public health guidelines -and putting sitting-duck prisoners at risk of serious illness or death-by refusing to hand out masks in their detention centers.\n\nThe Daily Beast reached out to 35 sheriff's offices across the country whose leaders have vocally opposed mask mandates. Of the 16 who responded, only four have enforced mask policies. Three sheriff's officials said they are not handing out masks at all, while four said they refuse to force prisoners to wear them. The rest declined to comment.\n\nAccording to The Marshall Project , at least 249,883 people in America's prisons and jails have tested positive for COVID-19 since March. The COVID-19 case rate among the inmate population is approximately four times higher in federal and state prisons than in the rest of the United States-and twice as deadly. And despite cramped conditions and high rates of pre-existing health conditions among the 1.3 million currently incarcerated, detention centers aren't reducing their populations enough to curtail the spread of the virus.\n\nDetainees at the Rockingham County Detention Center near Durham, North Carolina, don't even have access to protective gear, including masks. In Alabama, one sheriff's office has come up with a unique excuse to avoid protecting inmates by handing out masks-insisting inmates at Madison County Jail are simply \"going to eat them.\" The same indifference to inmate safety is evident at Flagler County Jail in Florida , where inmates are also denied masks unless they've tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nRogues who refuse to play ball with officials desperate to control infections by enforcing mask mandates on the general public are by now well-known. But for the local sheriff departments who told The Daily Beast that mask policies have been implemented in their jails, the reason is simple: Detention centers are being overrun by COVID-19 amid a massive nationwide surge. And when they aren't giving bizarre reasons for denying their inmates masks, some of the same law-enforcement officials who have spoken out against mask mandates are imposing them on their own detainees.\n\n\"I am not the mask police and I am not going to enforce any curfews or mask use. Hell, I had 14 people at my house for Thanksgiving so I would have had to call the police at myself,\" Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones told The Daily Beast. \"But even I demand masks in my jail because, as I am sure you are aware, COVID-19 is kicking our ass here in Ohio.\"\n\nEven in Colorado's El Paso County, home to one of the state's largest COVID-19 outbreaks-where Sheriff Bill Elder refused to cite residents flouting the governor's mask mandate -officials told The Daily Beast they finally began providing cloth masks to inmates in November.\n\nOn Tuesday, inmates at the El Paso County Jail sued Elder , alleging their lives were being put at risk during the pandemic after two-thirds of the facility's population tested positive for COVID-19. The lawsuit, filed in conjunction with the ACLU, described failures in quarantine policies and medical care for COVID-19 inmates-and how some, desperate for face coverings, would make their own out of bedsheets and underwear.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends all correctional and detention facilities implement mask use \"in public settings where social-distancing measures are difficult to maintain.\" Additionally, the agency insists routinely laundered masks should also be provided \"at no cost to incarcerated/detained individuals\" and that detention centers should explain the importance of face coverings.\n\nLaw enforcement officials against mask use for inmates are now feeling pressure from state and public health officials, who are desperately looking to local law enforcement to uphold restrictions amid an out-of-control outbreak. The virus has also had a devastating effect on prison staff, as approximately 62,171 employees have tested positive for COVID-19 and 108 have died since the start of the pandemic, according to the Marshall Project.\n\nThomas Abt, the director of the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice, told The Daily Beast that more hardline restrictions should be put in place in jails and prisons for the safety of both inmates and staffers.\n\n\"Given the proven effectiveness of masking and the heightened risks associated with jails and prisons, the Commission strongly recommends universal masking for all correctional staff and impacted populations when indoors and in close contact with others,\" Abt said.\n\nRockingham County Detention Center in North Carolina\n\nIn North Carolina's deep-red Rockingham County, the sheriff's office insists a mask mandate for inmates is unnecessary since none of the facility's 185 inmates have tested positive for the deadly virus to date.\n\n\"Inmates of the Rockingham County Detention Center are not required to wear masks, nor are they provided masks,\" Rockingham County Sheriff's Lt. Kevin Suthard told The Daily Beast. \"There are isolation protocols in place and medical screenings for new detainees upon entry and if any inmate should potentially have a possible exposure or display symptoms.\"\n\nIn June, Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page- who previously referred to the governor's statewide mask mandate as \"unenforceable \"-insisted deputies \"will NOT be citing or arresting individuals for not following the face-mask mandate \" for residents as directed by North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper . He also signed a resolution from the North Carolina Sheriffs' Association urging Cooper to allow indoor worship services with restrictions \"similar to those allowing local retail businesses to operate.\"\n\nLast month, Page tested positive for COVID-19. Suthard, however, insisted that Page \"never stated he does not believe in enforcement of the governor's individual mask mandate.\"\n\n\"Because of that wording within the governor's own executive order at the time, our attorneys advised us that a mask mandate on an individual level was unenforceable,\" he noted, adding that Page wears masks and believes in voluntary compliance through education.\n\nEven so, a mask mandate still has not been implemented at the Rockingham County Detention Center and inmates are not even provided face coverings.\n\n\"We have based our COVID-related protocols on the recommendations of the CDC, our state and local health and human services departments, and our legal department,\" Suthard insisted.\n\nFlagler County Jail in Florida\n\nA few states away, in Flagler County, Florida, a local sheriff is adamant that a mask mandate would be \"overly burdensome to enforce.\"\n\nIn a July open letter to residents in Flagler, Sheriff Rick Staly insisted that making his deputies enforce a mask order would only exacerbate tensions between law enforcement and the community-and even questioned the validity of the CDC's guidelines on face coverings.\n\n\"First, let's remember that when the pandemic started the CDC said face masks were not necessary. Then later it was necessary for older residents and now the CDC recommends wearing by everyone,\" Staly wrote .\n\nA spokesperson for Flagler County Jail said inmates can't even choose whether they want to wear masks-because they aren't given face coverings at all. The spokesperson added that jail employees, deputies, and visitors are required to wear masks while interacting with inmates.\n\nPrisoners are only provided masks when they are COVID-19 positive, exhibiting severe symptoms, or have been exposed to someone with the deadly virus.\n\n\"Upon negative test and/or 14 days without symptom, they are eligible for housing and the masks are retrieved,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMarion County Jail in Florida\n\nAbout an hour west, in Marion County, Florida, the local sheriff is open about his anti-mask views.\n\nIn an Aug. 11 email to the Marion County Sheriff's Department, Sheriff Billy Woods said \"masks will not be worn\" by deputies on duty (with some exceptions during visits to courthouses, jails, and public schools). He also barred the protective gear for visitors to his office, even as the state was experiencing a second wave of the coronavirus.\n\n\"In light of the current events when it comes to the sentiment and/or hatred toward law enforcement in our country today, this is being done to ensure there is clear communication and for identification purposes of any individual walking into a lobby,\" Woods wrote in the email viewed by The Daily Beast.\n\nThat sentiment, according to Marion County Sheriff Sgt. Paul Bloom, has trickled down to the Marion County Jail-where inmates are not forced to wear masks despite screenings and education about the effects of COVID-19. The sheriff's department said inmates are provided masks.\n\n\"Most inmates refuse to wear the masks or be tested for COVID,\" Marion County Sheriff Sgt. Paul Bloom insisted. \"For some, it is a priority, but for others, it doesn't matter. We cannot force masks.\"\n\nThe detention center, which houses 1,500 inmates, has had a consistent 1 percent COVID test-positivity rate over the last few months.\n\n\"We can only continue to utilize strict cleaning methods and make the masks available for them if they choose,\" Bloom said, stressing \"our positivity rates in the jail have been lower than they are in the general public in Florida.\"\n\n\"In short, inmates with COVID are isolated together from those without COVID, and masks are made available to inmates that want or feel that they need them,\" he added.\n\nMadison County Jail in Alabama\n\nFor Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who specializes in infectious diseases, the congregate settings of prisons make them so vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks that masks should be mandatory.\n\n\"Prisons are hot spots where we have seen cases occur en masse, so I do think that having a face-covering policy that is very strict is essential,\" Adalja told The Daily Beast. \"There should be a pretty strict mandate or else prisoners are going to have to be confined in order to really stop the spread. Prison staff also don't often wear masks as well.\"\n\nAdalja said the argument that masks pose a safety threat-because a metal nose piece could be used as a weapon-is \"completely irresponsible.\"\n\nThat's the excuse used by officials at the Madison County Jail in Alabama, where inmates are banned from wearing face coverings despite the county's mandatory mask-wearing order.\n\n\"You give them face masks [with] a nose piece-with those metal pieces in them-they're going to eat them,\" a sheriff's spokesperson claimed. \"They're going to swallow them.\"\n\nAccording to the Madison County Sheriff's Office, inmates could harm themselves or others with masks-either with the metal piece or by tying the cloth pieces together to make ropes.\n\nMadison County Sheriff Kevin Turner has also spoken out publicly against the county's mask mandate, insisting he will not arrest residents who violate the order.\n\n\"Our main act of enforcement will be to educate the citizens about [COVID-19] and encourage any citizens of Madison County that [wearing a mask in public] is the right thing to do,\" Turner said in a June video statement.\n\nInstead of implementing a mask mandate, Madison County Jail has prohibited nonessential personnel and increased sanitation protocols. According to the Madison County Health Department, while the county-wide order requires mask use in public, it does not apply to correction centers because they have \"their own guidance.\"\n\nAdalja, however, said the excuses are unjustifiable and can be easily solved with face shields.\n\n\"If prisons don't want to use face masks for security reasons, fine-use face shields. Make masks mandatory for prison staff, provide more outlets for social distancing,\" Adalja said, adding that \"if you allow widespread infections in jails, you put local hospitals into crisis.\"\n\n\"Giving inmates access to masks is the easiest way to mitigate the spread. Not doing so is just irresponsible and will lead to more unnecessary deaths,\" he added.\n\nButler County Jail in Ohio\n\nEven Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones , one of the most vocal anti-mask sheriffs in the country, believes a mandate should be in place for those in lockup.\n\n\"For me and my county jail-it's a mask mandate,\" Jones told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe sentiment is shocking considering the Ohio Republican-known for declaring \" I don't kneel for any cause \" during the nationwide protests against police brutality-has slammed Gov. Mike DeWine's mask mandate on national television several times . He has also stressed he is not going to do anything to help enforce the COVID-19 restriction, telling The Daily Beast \"the community is tired and worn out over these mandates.\" ( To date , Ohio residents have to wear a mask inside public areas and outdoors where social distancing is impossible.)\n\n\"I'm just a poor sheriff trying to keep everyone healthy and everyone working. But the government has overreached here in Ohio. And I am the government,\" Jones said. \"So I refuse to enforce any curfews or mask use or issue citations.\"\n\nDespite his controversial view on face coverings-insisting that \"doctors have been all over the place with masks; I have no idea what to believe anymore\"-Jones admits there is no harm in having a mask mandate at Butler County Jail, which has seen several coronavirus outbreaks, including one that wiped out 10 percent of the facility's staff.\n\n\"The way we do it here, every prisoner has two cloth masks they can clean themselves. If they come out of their cell, they are supposed to have their mask on,\" Jones said, adding that cleanings have also increased at the site after several COVID-10 outbreaks. \"We also reduce the number of jail employees while inmates are out to ensure they don't catch anything.\"\n\nJones added that employees \"have to have a mask on\" and that one of the three buildings at Butler County Jail is now dedicated to COVID-19-positive inmates.\n\nThe Butler County Jail is one of several local detention centers in the state banned from transporting inmates to state facilities because of its high number of COVID-positive inmates. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction confirmed to The Daily Beast the county jail is \"not currently permitted to send us incarcerated adults\" after shipping so many COVID-19 inmates to state facilities.\n\nFor Jones, getting put on the state prison system's \"naughty list\" was a wake-up call, showing him the importance of masks for inmates and the true danger of COVID-19. While he insists he's still not sure whether masks help curtail the spread, the sheriff admitted he wears a mask and encourages his family members to do the same.\n\n\"All I know is, even if we find out in a few years the masks were worthless, there is no harm in wearing it now,\" Jones said. \"People should have the choice. And in jail, where I get to make the choices, inmates wear masks.\"\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Trump's Public-Land Boss Says Feds Should Bow to Sheriffs\n\nWhen William Pendley became acting head of the Bureau of Land Management without congressional approval this summer, watchdogs of right-wing movements expressed concern over some of his more fringe views. An op-ed Pendley authored this month is giving them new reason to worry.\n\nPendley has spent a long career arguing against federal land and environmental protections-a stance that makes him an unlikely guardian of the country's public lands. This month he published an op-ed in the Las Vegas Review-Journal . calling on BLM employees to maintain \"deference\" to local sheriffs. The message appears to borrow language from a cluster of fringe-right movements that Pendley has previously backed. That could mean trouble for Pendley's own federal agents, experts say.\n\nThe op-ed could appeal to the so-called \"Patriot\" movement, a loose collection of far-right ideologies, said Lindsay Schubiner, a program director at Western States Center.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Pendley's statement that federal BLM agents should defer to local law enforcement not only undermines his own staff, but potentially puts them in danger,\" Schubiner told The Daily Beast. \"This rhetoric risks emboldening the Patriot movement, which already sees BLM agents as their enemy.\"\n\nPendley's op-ed described local sheriffs as the top brass of law enforcement.\n\n\"[T]he bureau is reaching out to local sheriffs to ensure that Rangers recognize that, although local law enforcement bears primary responsibility for enforcing state and federal law, Rangers are there to assist-lending their expertise to better local communities,\" Pendley wrote. \"Rangers, therefore, partner with local law enforcement, while recognizing that counties are a governmental-arm of sovereign states. Maintaining that deference is essential to making BLM a truly productive and valued partner to Western communities.\"\n\nThe BLM did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe issue is more than just an inter-agency dispute. For decades, a coalition of ranchers, right-wingers, and private industries have rallied against federal land ownership in western states.\n\nIn the 1970s and '80s, members of the \"Sagebrush Rebellion\" objected to conservation laws that kept certain wilderness areas under federal control. Despite the group's anti-government posturing, they still wrangled significant support from politicians, including then-presidential candidate Ronald Reagan. Today, Pendley uses the Twitter handle @Sagebrush_Rebel, and has written a book of the same title.\n\nAlthough the pro-privatization movement was right-wing even in the 80s, it has since drifted further right, observers have noted. In the 2010s, it became increasingly entangled with the Patriot movement.\n\n\"The barriers are down,\" the High Country News wrote in 2016 of increasing crossover between Sagebrush types and militant members of the Patriot movement. \"Now, a single event like Recapture, the 2014 Bundy Ranch standoff or the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge occupation, broadcast globally and instantly via social media, draws supporters from across the extreme right, from other Sagebrush Rebels to pro-gun militiamen to local politicians who have no qualms about standing cheek-by-jowl with people aiming rifles at federal agents.\"\n\nThese circles often hold local sheriffs in high regard. Police who join the far-right Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, for instance, believe sheriffs are the highest level of the law. It's a conspiratorial view that previously appeared with the white supremacist group the Posse Comitatus, and has also found footing with the tax-protest movement, the militia movement, and with \"sovereign citizens,\" a group that falsely believes themselves to be liberated from the federal government and most laws.\n\nJohn Freemuth, the Cecil D. Andrus endowed chair for environment and public lands at Boise State University told the energy publication E&E News that Pendley's comments would appeal to some of this far-right fringe.\n\n\"He revved up the crazies with that statement,\" Freemuth said. \"Now some nut job could confront [BLM rangers] with, 'Well, your boss said you're subservient.'\"\n\nChain-of-command disputes in land issues have previously led to bloodshed in western states, including during the 2016 standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in rural Oregon. During the 40-day siege, federal agents squared off with a group of militia and sovereign citizen types, culminating in the shooting death of a rancher by federal agents. Members of that skirmish had also participated in a 2014 standoff with BLM agents, which Pendley described as an \"overreaction\" by the agency he now leads. (Sovereign citizens are responsible for a number of police shootings in their own right .)\n\nPendley's post, which was unapproved by Congress, was supposed to end Sept. 30, but received a last-minute extension (also unapproved by Congress) allowing him to continue into January. Even before the extension, BLM veterans warned that Pendley could shake up the agency in a matter of days.\n\n\"Someone like the acting director of the BLM can make scores of decisions over the course of the week: How fast to do this, how slow to walk that, what position to take on this particular issue, or what to tell the Justice Department about how to defend a particular case,\" John Leshy, a former Interior Department lawyer told E&E News in early August .\n\nDean Bibles, a BLM veteran who worked at the agency for more than 30 years told E&E news that while Pendley worked at the Department of the Interior, he'd hosted conferences where he allowed oil and gas industry executives to develop regulations.\n\n\"I just said, 'William, this is not legal. You don't develop regulations with the people you are dealing with,'\" Bibles recalled. \"He said, 'Well, if you're uncomfortable you don't have to stay.' And I said, 'I am more than uncomfortable,' and I left.\"\n\nPreviously, Pendley was president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, which calls on the federal government to sell off public lands. His close ties with oil companies and the mining industry have led him to recuse himself from BLM matters relating to almost 60 of his former clients. (The recusal is not enough, the Union of Concerned Scientists argued last month .)\n\nSchubiner noted that the Patriot movement's emphasis on local sheriffs isn't just a libertarian preference for small government; it can also work to kneecap law enforcement that doesn't align with the movement's views.\n\n\"The Patriot movement claims to support county sheriffs, but only those who abide by its pseudo-constitutional proclamations,\" she said. \"So when you have the head of the BLM essentially saying that his agents should be subordinate to county sheriffs, what he's doing is allowing rogue sheriffs and the broader Patriot movement to hold the Constitution up with one hand while crushing it with the other.\"\n\nkelly.weill@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Sheriff: Trump Wants Us To Break The Law\n\nFormer Political Reporter\n\nPresident Donald Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants has some sheriffs worried the White House is pushing them to break the law - demanding they violate the Fourth Amendment or face vilification from the commander-in-chief.\n\n\"It's a total mess,\" said Bob Gualtieri, the sheriff of Pinellas County, Fla.\n\nAt issue is a complicated question: Should sheriffs keep undocumented immigrants in their jails for more time than otherwise necessary so that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers can pick them up to be deported?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe White House is demanding sheriffs do just that, by honoring ICE's requests that sheriffs keep certain people locked up long enough for the agency to take them into custody. Those requests are called detainers. And many sheriffs would happily comply - except that federal courts have ruled repeatedly that the Fourth Amendment bars them from keeping an undocumented immigrant in jail who would otherwise go free.\n\n\"If we violate the law by doing what they ask us to do, we're subjecting ourselves, no question, to civil liability and civil rights violations,\" Gualtieri said.\n\nHe added that he spoke about the issue recently with Stephen Miller - a top White House advisor working on immigration - who didn't seem to understand his Constitutional concerns.\n\n\"My takeaway from that conversation with Stephen Miller is that he was uninformed about this problem,\" Gualtieri said. \"I think that there are certain admin officials who think that these warrants [detainers] solve the problem, and are saying, 'What are you sheriffs doing? Why aren't you cooperating?' when they don't know that it is clearly a problem and that we can't do it.\"\n\n\"I give them the absolute benefit of the doubt,\" Gualtieri added. \"I think that they're uninformed on the problem.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson directed The Daily Beast to ICE for comment on this story. And ICE spokesperson Liz Johnson said the agency is exploring \"a variety of options that address the concerns of our sheriff partners when honoring ICE detainers.\"\n\n\"A variety of options are under review,\" she said in a statement, \"but no final decisions or formal plans have been submitted for action at this time.\"\n\n\"The agency maintains that detainers are legally-authorized requests, upon which a law enforcement agency may rely, to continue to maintain custody of an alien for up to 48 hours so that ICE may safely assume custody for removal purposes,\" she added.\n\nSheriff Richard Stanek, of Hennepin County, Minn., told The Daily Beast that ICE is demanding sheriffs violate the Constitution.\n\n\"The current ICE detainer notion that Sheriffs can and should hold alleged illegal aliens beyond the time that their local charges are adjudicated is in violation of their constitutional rights while in the United States of America, and ICE knows this,\" he said in a statement provided to The Daily Beast. \"The U.S. courts have ruled against this notion time and time again - the way forward for ICE and local Sheriffs in partnership to protect public safety is a solution that both provides for public safety while at the same time protecting an individual's constitutional rights.\"\n\nMost experts estimate that about 40 percent of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. came here legally but then stayed longer than their visas allowed. Overstaying a visa is a civil offense, not a criminal one. When an undocumented immigrant who has overstayed a visa gets arrested for an unrelated offense, ICE will sometimes ask the sheriff to keep that immigrant in custody for longer than necessary so their officers can pick the immigrant up to be deported.\n\nBut jailing someone who hasn't committed a crime violates the Fourth Amendment, according to several federal judges. And when sheriffs do so, immigrants' rights groups sometimes sue them. For cash-strapped law enforcement offices, these suits can be a real threat. In 2014, an Oregon sheriff's office paid $100,000 to settle such a lawsuit .\n\nDespite those legal fears, many sheriffs want to help the Trump administration with its deportation efforts. Gualtieri is one of those sheriffs, and he told The Daily Beast he's found a work-around: His office has signed a contract with ICE to essentially become a temporary ICE detention facility when ICE requests they do so.\n\nThe set-up lets Gualtieri hold undocumented immigrants if ICE asks him to. He is heading the National Sheriffs Association's efforts to resolve the issue. Other sheriffs say they also want to make the same agreement with ICE.\n\nThere are two issues, though, according to Gualtieri: The White House doesn't get it, and the bureaucracy at ICE isn't moving quickly enough to sign up sheriffs.\n\n\"We can't keep doing it this way,\" he told The Daily Beast. \"The sheriffs are in the absolute definition of a dilemma because we want to cooperate - we don't want criminal illegals on the street, we don't want a Kate Steinle situation, we want people safe - but at the same time, we're obligated to follow the law.\"\n\nGualtieri has visited Washington multiple times over the last few months and had numerous conversations with administration officials. His goal is to get ICE to sign contracts with the sheriffs who want them, so those sheriffs won't risk lawsuits by cooperating with the agency.\n\nBut working with ICE is taking a long time, despite the White House's insistence that sheriffs cooperate immediately. And the situation has some sheriffs quite irked.\n\nSheriff Greg Champagne of St. Charles Parish, La., is on the executive committee of the National Sheriffs Association. Along with Gualtieri, he is working with ICE on the issue. And he said it's been tough. All he wants, he told The Daily Beast, is to sign an agreement with the agency so he can keep undocumented immigrants in his jail without potentially getting sued. But the ICE bureaucracy is taking forever.\n\n\"It just needs to be expedited,\" he said. \"They need the people to do it, they need the effort to do it. We're a little frustrated.\"\n\nFormer Political Reporter\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

Arpaio's policies have included racial profiling and detaining immigrants in a scorching outdoor tent city jail, which Arpaio once referred to as his own \"concentration camp.\"\n\nImmigrants rights and civil liberties groups have harshly criticized Trump's decision:\n\nCecillia Wang, ACLU Deputy Legal Director: \"With his pardon of Arpaio, Trump has chosen lawlessness over justice, division over unity, hurt over healing. Once again, the president has acted in support of illegal, failed immigration enforcement practices that target people of color and have been struck down by the courts. His pardon of Arpaio is a presidential endorsement of racism.\"\n\nCarlos Garcia , director of Puente: \"In pardoning Arpaio, Trump has lost all legitimacy. After Charlottesville, Trump came to Phoenix to solidify himself as a white supremacist candidate. Convicted Sheriff Arpaio should be tried for much more than contempt of court. His Sheriffs killed Marty Atencio in his jail, kept humans in an outdoor tent city he called his own concentration camp, and he said he was proud to be called KKK .  A Sheriff who claims pride in being called KKK is who Trump sees as a 'great American patriot.' Equipping armed vigilantes with ski masks and the conducting worst racial profiling DOJ investigators ever witnessed is what Trump calls, 'just doing his job.' Everyone in this country should be extremely alarmed by Trump's decision to pardon Arpaio. Tonight Trump sent a clear message that it's ok to break the law as long as its to further a white supremacist agenda. Our message is that white supremacy will not be pardoned. We will stand in defiance of Trump's hate and in protection of our communities like we had to for the past twenty plus years under Arpaio. Both the President and the convicted Sheriff will be remembered as stains on this country's history.\"\n\nDerrick Johnson , interim president and CEO of the NAACP : \"Joe Arpaio ruled Maricopa County, Arizona with an iron-fist, under the guise of 'law and order. For decades, Arpaio used fear, cruelty and tyranny to advance his own political ambitions at the deaths and suffering of countless people of color. Put simply, Arpaio is a remorseless criminal who took the law into his own hands and enacted racist policing policies. He betrayed his oaths as a police officer to protect and serve the people of his community. Arpaio should not have been pardoned. On the same night that President Trump has directed the military to implement his ban on transgender people, his decision to pardon Arpaio is yet another insult to marginalized voices across our nation. In the wake of the riot in Charlottesville started by domestic terrorists, neo-Nazis and white supremacists, Trump has once again shown us his true colors and his support for racism and violence. By pardoning Arpaio, Trump has endorsed Arpaio's abhorrent behavior and has opened the gates for other bigots to follow in his footsteps.\"\n\nRecent Democracy Now!

Trump granted a Presidential pardon to Joe Arpaio, former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona.\"\n\nAhead of Trump's speech in Phoenix on Tuesday, there was much speculation that Trump would pardon Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court for defying an order to stop his deputies from detaining people on suspicion of being undocumented. While he didn't pardon Arpaio on Tuesday, Trump hinted during his speech that a pardon would be coming soon. For more, we speak with Francisca Porchas, organizing director of Puente Arizona, a grassroots human rights movement for migrant justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined now by Francisca Porchas, organizing director to Puente Arizona, a grassroots human rights movement for migrant justice. Her group helped organize the main protest against Trump's visit to Phoenix Tuesday night. She's joining us from Phoenix.\n\nFrancisca, welcome to Democracy Now! You heard President Trump say there are very few people outside, that he had spoken to the authorities. How many people were outside? And what was your message outside? And your response to President Trump's speech inside?\n\nFRANCISCA PORCHAS : He's lying. There were about 3,000 to 4,000 people, and hard to tell, but at least that many. And it was a really big crowd, lots of people, different races, different-multigenerational, multicultural. And in general, I think he just goes on saying lies. There was a big crowd. There was a big crowd inside, as well. We protested starting at 4 p.m., all the way until the cops got pretty aggressive with people in the streets, tear-gassing them, shooting them with rubber bullets, without any provocation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about President Trump's address inside.\n\nFRANCISCA PORCHAS : Yeah, I mean, I think we're the most-we're very disturbed, obviously. Every time he speaks, we are. But I think one of the biggest things for us is the potential pardon of Sherriff Joe Arpaio. For us, it's a slap in the face of all of the years of organizing that it took for us to hold him accountable, of the lawsuit that came because of his racial profiling in the streets, of all of those people like Noemi Ramos [ sic ], who-Romero, who was actually detained as a young person trying to raise money for her DACA . And he did almost 90 workplace raids. One of them was where she worked. She now has a felony conviction, can never be able to apply for DACA and is forever impacted. And so, for us, it's a slap in the face for him to say he's going to pardon Arpaio.\n\nWho should be pardoned are the people who he criminalized, the people who are now not ever going to be able to come out of the shadows, as you may say, or have a real chance at living a normal life. That's who truly should be pardoned. For us, him saying he's going to pardon Arpaio is a very dangerous thing. We're in the middle of police. I mean, we saw them last night, very aggressive. This is the most violent I've ever seen the Phoenix Police Department be. And they are a very violent department. But in saying he's going to pardon somebody who's been historically racist and xenophobic and violent towards immigrant people and the community overall, he's sending out a message to the rest of the country and to the rest of law enforcement in this country that it's OK to be this racist, that it's OK to be this abusive and this violent and this vile against immigrant people and people of color and all people, because you will be pardoned, because you will be excused, because you will have the most powerful person in this country say that it's OK and that you cannot be criminalized for doing your job, when that job is racism.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Democracy Now! 's Deena Guzder interviewed Sheriff Joe Arpaio at the Republican National Convention last year. He said he's a strong supporter of Trump's immigration policy.\n\nSHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : I support the majority of his policy. We have to do something about the border. Most of the illegals and drug traffic comes from Mexico. I'm concerned about the drug traffic. When he says, \"Put up the wall,\" I like the wall to keep the drugs out of our country. That's the most important thing that's going on, not the illegal immigration. That's important, but what about all the drugs coming in, the heroin and everything else? Because it's a violation of the law to come into this country illegally, you must secure your borders. We have terrorism now. We have cops being killed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That is Sheriff Joe Arpaio at the Republican convention, long a supporter of President Trump. When he was running for president, Trump brought Arpaio up to Iowa to campaign with him, and now is talking about one of his earliest supporters, now is hinting that he will be pardoning him. Francisca, for people who don't know who Sheriff Arpaio is, talk about why he is such a target of deep concern, fear and animosity in the Latino community in Arizona.\n\nFRANCISCA PORCHAS : Yeah, he was in power for about 25 years. He was the first lawman of the first agency, law agency, here in the United States to sign a federal agreement with the U.S. to collaborate with Immigrant Customs Enforcement. So he was very excited, deputized his sheriffs to go out and terrorize people. He would surround a six-block radius in communities of color, poor people communities, Latino communities, and literally, with his civil posse-right?-a bunch of racist volunteers of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, would start rounding people up, rounding people up if they had no identification on them, putting them in the paddy wagon. And he became both the ICE officer, the immigration judge and the deporting officer, because sheriffs were giving people 20-year penalties and bans from coming back into the country.\n\nAnd so, in 2011, there was a lawsuit by the ACLU that said, \"You are engaging in racial profiling.\" He terrorized the-he did almost 90 workplace raids, where he picked up 700 people. And he claims that he's deported 80,000 immigrant people. So, he's been terrorizing. He had been terrorizing the immigrant community for 10 years. He had been persecuting them. He had targeted them. He had blatantly, intentionally been racist against an entire community here. And so, when this lawsuit came about, a judge decided that it had to stop, that no more people driving while looking brown and looking immigrant could be stopped by him and asked for papers. And he violated this. He violated this court order and has been found guilty of criminal contempt.\n\nBut this is-to us, it's a symbol of racism. It's a symbol of anti-immigration. It's a symbol of domestic terrorism. That's what Joe Arpaio is to us. And we were able to take him out of power at a very weak point last November. We can't imagine what an Arpaio reign would have been like under Donald Trump. And we suspected that he was going to be pardoned, but, to us, again, it's a slap in the face. It is saying to us that it's OK, all the terrorism and all the racism and torture and trauma that people have been through in this county, and that it's OK for law enforcement to do this across the nation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A new report from McClatchy says that some White House aides are counseling President Trump to, quote, \"strike an ambitious deal with Congress that offers DREAMers protection in exchange for legislation that pays for a border wall and more detention facilities, drastically curbing legal immigration and implementing E-Verify.\" Francisca, your response?\n\nFRANCISCA PORCHAS : Absolutely. We see it coming. I mean, these are tactics to divide and split the movement. And we're very happy the United We Dream put out a statement that they will not be using themselves or the DREAMers as a bargaining tool or as a bargaining chip. And so, we're very alarmed. We're disgusted at this. And we're not going to allow it, as a movement, to happen.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the wall, the issue of the wall and what it means, and President Trump saying he is willing to shut down government, to which he got huge applause?\n\nFRANCISCA PORCHAS : Yeah, I mean, he's been talking about this wall forever. And the reality is that the border has been a military zone for a very long time, where we've lost a lot of people. And again, it's just a way to heighten people's racism and scapegoating and making it sound like there truly is a war. The reality is, is that re-entry into this country is at an all-time low. And what's happening is that-what's happening is that deportations at a domestic level are 40 percent up, and 70 percent up in detainers, meaning that people are not being let out once they're caught up in ICE . But people who are living here in this country are the ones that are being persecuted and the ones that are being detained and put in a deportation process. And really, the border isn't-I mean, it's 40 percent. It's significantly down in terms of re-entry. And it's just another excuse to militarize and for supremacy, for U.S. imperialism to show the rest of the world that it's a fortress and to show its power. And it is a campaign promise. But the reality, it's a lie. It's a lie. Re-entry is at an all-time low. And even if it wasn't, it's a declaration of war, both on Mexico's sovereignty, but also on its people and the people that live along the border. And the reality is, is that our folks are being persecuted internally, and there's hyper-enforcement like we have never seen.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Before we go, Francisca, I wanted to ask you about this latest news. A federal judge ruling the state of Arizona violated students' First and 14th Amendment rights by eliminating a Mexican-American studies program from the Tucson public schools that ended up banning books from public schools, like Rethinking Columbus , Shakespeare's play The Tempest , Pedagogy of the Oppressed and other books. The significance of this ruling?\n\nFRANCISCA PORCHAS : Yeah, it's a victory. It's really great news in the midst of a lot of terrible rhetoric and racist rhetoric and police violence in the streets of Phoenix. So we're just really happy that our young people are going to get to know a little part of their history. And in the midst of, you know, white supremacists in this country and the president of the United States celebrating Confederate monuments and, quote-unquote, \"its racist heritage,\" we're very happy that our own people, our own students are going to get to learn about their own heritage and culture.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you very much, Franscisca, for joining us. Francisca Porchas, organizing director at Puente Arizona, a grassroots human rights movement for migrant justice. Her group helped organize the main protest against Trump's visit to Phoenix on Tuesday night.\n\nThis is Democracy Now!

We go to Arizona to speak with Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, who calls the law \"unconstitutional\" and says he won't enforce it. [includes rush transcript]\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Protests continue across the country to denounce Arizona's controversial new anti-immigrant law, which allows police officers to stop and interrogate anyone they suspect is an undocumented immigrant. On Tuesday, city councils in the Arizona cities of Flagstaff and Tucson both passed measures to sue the state over the new law. The state's professional basketball team, the Phoenix Suns, wore shirts reading \"Los Suns\" last night in a tribute to Cinco de Mayo and to voice their opposition to the law. Steve Kerr, the team's general manager, said the law, quote, \"rings up images of Nazi Germany.\" Student protests have occurred in Arizona and other states. On Wednesday, seventy students from five Flagstaff schools walked out of classes. And at the University of California at Berkeley, about seventy students have entered their fourth day of a hunger strike. The Reverend Al Sharpton traveled to Phoenix Wednesday to voice his support for a boycott of Arizona. And at the White House, President Obama weighed in on the law during a celebration of Cinco de Mayo. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Today reminds us that America's diversity is America's strength. That's why I spoke out against the recently passed law in Arizona. Make no mistake - make no mistake, our immigration system is broken. And after so many years in which Washington has failed to meet its responsibilities, Americans are right to be frustrated, including folks along border states. But the answer isn't to undermine fundamental principles that define us as a nation. We can't start singling out people because of who they look like or how they talk or how they dress. We can't turn law-abiding American citizens and law-abiding immigrants into subjects of suspicion and abuse. We can't divide the American people that way. That's not the answer. That's not who we are as the United States of America. And that's why I have instructed my administration to closely monitor the new law in Arizona, to examine the civil rights and other implications that it may have. That's why we have to close the door on this kind of misconceived action by meeting our obligations here in Washington. AMY GOODMAN : President Obama speaking on Cinco de Mayo on Wednesday. The Arizona law has also been met with resistance by some top law enforcement officials in Arizona. Our first guest today is Clarence Dupnik, sheriff of Pima County in Arizona. The county includes the city of Tucson and over 120 miles of the Arizona-Mexico border. He recently wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal titled \"Arizona's Immigration Mistake.\" Clarence Dupnik, sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, we welcome you to Democracy Now! SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Thank you very much. AMY GOODMAN : Can you tell us why you think this law is a mistake and what you're doing about it? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Sure. First of all, the law is totally unnecessary. We already have the authority to stop and detain illegal immigrants and turn them over to the Border Patrol, and we do that on a regular daily basis. This law will have no impact whatsoever on illegal immigration. None at all. We already have the authority. We didn't need it. But what that law now does is put us in a position where we are damned if we do and damned if we don't, because on one hand we get sued by people who think we're illegally profiling, and there's a clause in the law which I've never heard of in any other law - and I've been a sheriff here for thirty years - that says any citizen who doesn't think we are enforcing this law can sue us. And that is just outrageous. It's an anti-law-enforcement law, in my opinion, puts us in an impossible situation. It puts us in an impossible situation with the Hispanic community. What they've done is driven a wedge between us and the Hispanic community. We depend on our community, Hispanics especially, for information, for cooperation in our crime-fighting efforts. What we really need to stop illegal immigration is more federal assistance on securing that border, and we desperately need reform of immigration laws. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Sheriff, what about - you've raised especially questions about the standard for stopping people, the reasonable suspicion standard. Could you talk about that and your concerns about what that opens the door to? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : You bet. When the law was first passed, which would have been about nine days ago, there was a clause that said reasonable suspicion of anybody. And every Hispanic in this country, especially in Arizona, must have awakened - and I've talked to many of them personally - the next day to feel like they've been kicked in the teeth, like they are now second-class citizens, they have a target on their back, because when they leave the house, they're going to have to take papers with them and prepare to be stopped and questioned. And that, overnight, has made Hispanics second-class citizens. AMY GOODMAN : Can you explain what it is you actually are supposed to do if you were to enforce this law? The issue of reasonable suspicion. What do your sheriffs do? What do you do? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, let me tell you what we do now, and I don't anticipate doing anything differently. I don't think the new law precludes state and local law enforcement from turning over immigrants, illegal immigrants, to the Border Patrol. But in the routine course of our duties, when we encounter illegal immigrants, and there are a variety of ways that that happens, especially out in the rural desert areas, once we determine that they are in fact illegal, we call the Border Patrol and turn them over to them. But if we were to enforce this law, what - you know, the people that passed this law are very quick to complain about government overstepping, which is one of their biggest complaints, and the second one is taxation. If we were to start enforcing this law instead of turning them over to the Border Patrol like we do now, we would have to put them the Pima County Jail. We would put the jail into a crisis overnight. We would have to overwhelm the rest of the criminal justice system locally here and send the taxpayers a huge bill, which is just nonsense, in my opinion. It's irresponsible of the legislature to do this, and it would be irresponsible of me to do it, as well. JUAN GONZALEZ : But now, your county also includes a significant section of border area right there in southern Arizona. What do you say to those people in Arizona and other parts of the country who say that something has to be done to control the numbers of people who continue to pour into the United Stated over the border from Mexico? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, I say to them just what I just finished saying to you. The federal government needs to do a lot more to stop illegal immigration. And one of the things they need to do is illegal reform. And I understand that, and they understand that, as well. This isn't rocket science. But a few years ago, when the Bush administration militarized the border with National Guardsmen, they put handcuffs on them. They weren't allowed to do anything related to illegal aliens. They couldn't even drive a bus that had illegal aliens in it. What we need to do is to put more people on the border to secure it, more technology and more agents. But we really need reform. JUAN GONZALEZ : And what about the issue that, within days, the legislature attempted to amend the bill they had just passed? What were the amendments that they made? And did it really have any substantive impact on the legislation, the original legislation? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, you know, it's going to take legal experts with better legal minds than my own to answer that question. But the change that they made late last - a week ago, Thursday night, before they adjourned, was they said you can't use race, ethnicity or country of origin solely as a reason for stop. AMY GOODMAN : Could you be in legal trouble for not enforcing the law, Sheriff? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, that's a question that the lawyers are going to have to address. But in my opinion, we are enforcing the law. If we're arresting the illegal aliens and turning them over to the Border Patrol, that seems to be a far better approach from every point of view than what the legislature has done to us. AMY GOODMAN : Your police chief, the Tucson police chief, Roberto Villaseñor, says he's worried about the impact of the law on investigations, with victims and witnesses who might be afraid to come forward. He said he's opposing the law's enactment, but he'll work to see that it's implemented fairly in Tucson. Are you working with Chief Villaseñor? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : All of law enforcement in the state, I think, is working together. There are some of us who are elected officials and are taking political stands. But aside from that, there's a lot of, in my opinion, unanimity as to the problems that this law is causing for law enforcement. It's an anti-law-enforcement law, in my opinion. AMY GOODMAN : How much support do you have from other aspects of law enforcement, other departments around the state? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : You know, the truth of the matter is, I don't really know. AMY GOODMAN : And have you spoken to the Governor, Governor Brewer? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : I have not. AMY GOODMAN : Well, Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, we want to thank you very much for being with us, sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, speaking to us from Tucson. Thanks so much for joining us. SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Thanks for inviting me.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Today reminds us that America's diversity is America's strength.

But what that law now does is put us in a position where we are damned if we do and damned if we don't, because on one hand we get sued by people who think we're illegally profiling, and there's a clause in the law which I've never heard of in any other law - and I've been a sheriff here for thirty years - that says any citizen who doesn't think we are enforcing this law can sue us. And that is just outrageous. It's an anti-law-enforcement law, in my opinion, puts us in an impossible situation. It puts us in an impossible situation with the Hispanic community. What they've done is driven a wedge between us and the Hispanic community. We depend on our community, Hispanics especially, for information, for cooperation in our crime-fighting efforts. What we really need to stop illegal immigration is more federal assistance on securing that border, and we desperately need reform of immigration laws. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Sheriff, what about - you've raised especially questions about the standard for stopping people, the reasonable suspicion standard. Could you talk about that and your concerns about what that opens the door to? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : You bet. When the law was first passed, which would have been about nine days ago, there was a clause that said reasonable suspicion of anybody. And every Hispanic in this country, especially in Arizona, must have awakened - and I've talked to many of them personally - the next day to feel like they've been kicked in the teeth, like they are now second-class citizens, they have a target on their back, because when they leave the house, they're going to have to take papers with them and prepare to be stopped and questioned. And that, overnight, has made Hispanics second-class citizens. AMY GOODMAN : Can you explain what it is you actually are supposed to do if you were to enforce this law? The issue of reasonable suspicion. What do your sheriffs do? What do you do? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, let me tell you what we do now, and I don't anticipate doing anything differently. I don't think the new law precludes state and local law enforcement from turning over immigrants, illegal immigrants, to the Border Patrol. But in the routine course of our duties, when we encounter illegal immigrants, and there are a variety of ways that that happens, especially out in the rural desert areas, once we determine that they are in fact illegal, we call the Border Patrol and turn them over to them. But if we were to enforce this law, what - you know, the people that passed this law are very quick to complain about government overstepping, which is one of their biggest complaints, and the second one is taxation. If we were to start enforcing this law instead of turning them over to the Border Patrol like we do now, we would have to put them the Pima County Jail. We would put the jail into a crisis overnight. We would have to overwhelm the rest of the criminal justice system locally here and send the taxpayers a huge bill, which is just nonsense, in my opinion. It's irresponsible of the legislature to do this, and it would be irresponsible of me to do it, as well. JUAN GONZALEZ : But now, your county also includes a significant section of border area right there in southern Arizona. What do you say to those people in Arizona and other parts of the country who say that something has to be done to control the numbers of people who continue to pour into the United Stated over the border from Mexico? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, I say to them just what I just finished saying to you. The federal government needs to do a lot more to stop illegal immigration. And one of the things they need to do is illegal reform. And I understand that, and they understand that, as well. This isn't rocket science. But a few years ago, when the Bush administration militarized the border with National Guardsmen, they put handcuffs on them. They weren't allowed to do anything related to illegal aliens. They couldn't even drive a bus that had illegal aliens in it. What we need to do is to put more people on the border to secure it, more technology and more agents. But we really need reform. JUAN GONZALEZ : And what about the issue that, within days, the legislature attempted to amend the bill they had just passed? What were the amendments that they made? And did it really have any substantive impact on the legislation, the original legislation? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, you know, it's going to take legal experts with better legal minds than my own to answer that question. But the change that they made late last - a week ago, Thursday night, before they adjourned, was they said you can't use race, ethnicity or country of origin solely as a reason for stop. AMY GOODMAN : Could you be in legal trouble for not enforcing the law, Sheriff? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, that's a question that the lawyers are going to have to address. But in my opinion, we are enforcing the law. If we're arresting the illegal aliens and turning them over to the Border Patrol, that seems to be a far better approach from every point of view than what the legislature has done to us. AMY GOODMAN : Your police chief, the Tucson police chief, Roberto Villaseñor, says he's worried about the impact of the law on investigations, with victims and witnesses who might be afraid to come forward. He said he's opposing the law's enactment, but he'll work to see that it's implemented fairly in Tucson. Are you working with Chief Villaseñor? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : All of law enforcement in the state, I think, is working together. There are some of us who are elected officials and are taking political stands. But aside from that, there's a lot of, in my opinion, unanimity as to the problems that this law is causing for law enforcement. It's an anti-law-enforcement law, in my opinion. AMY GOODMAN : How much support do you have from other aspects of law enforcement, other departments around the state? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : You know, the truth of the matter is, I don't really know. AMY GOODMAN : And have you spoken to the Governor, Governor Brewer? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : I have not. AMY GOODMAN : Well, Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, we want to thank you very much for being with us, sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, speaking to us from Tucson. Thanks so much for joining us. SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Thanks for inviting me.\n\nThe Arizona law has also been met with resistance by some top law enforcement officials in Arizona. Our first guest today is Clarence Dupnik, sheriff of Pima County in Arizona. The county includes the city of Tucson and over 120 miles of the Arizona-Mexico border. He recently wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal titled \"Arizona's Immigration Mistake.\" Clarence Dupnik, sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, we welcome you to Democracy Now! SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Thank you very much. AMY GOODMAN : Can you tell us why you think this law is a mistake and what you're doing about it? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Sure.

This law will have no impact whatsoever on illegal immigration. None at all. We already have the authority. We didn't need it.

But what that law now does is put us in a position where we are damned if we do and damned if we don't, because on one hand we get sued by people who think we're illegally profiling, and there's a clause in the law which I've never heard of in any other law - and I've been a sheriff here for thirty years - that says any citizen who doesn't think we are enforcing this law can sue us. And that is just outrageous. It's an anti-law-enforcement law, in my opinion, puts us in an impossible situation. It puts us in an impossible situation with the Hispanic community. What they've done is driven a wedge between us and the Hispanic community. We depend on our community, Hispanics especially, for information, for cooperation in our crime-fighting efforts. What we really need to stop illegal immigration is more federal assistance on securing that border, and we desperately need reform of immigration laws. JUAN GONZALEZ : Well, Sheriff, what about - you've raised especially questions about the standard for stopping people, the reasonable suspicion standard. Could you talk about that and your concerns about what that opens the door to? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : You bet. When the law was first passed, which would have been about nine days ago, there was a clause that said reasonable suspicion of anybody. And every Hispanic in this country, especially in Arizona, must have awakened - and I've talked to many of them personally - the next day to feel like they've been kicked in the teeth, like they are now second-class citizens, they have a target on their back, because when they leave the house, they're going to have to take papers with them and prepare to be stopped and questioned. And that, overnight, has made Hispanics second-class citizens. AMY GOODMAN : Can you explain what it is you actually are supposed to do if you were to enforce this law? The issue of reasonable suspicion. What do your sheriffs do? What do you do? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, let me tell you what we do now, and I don't anticipate doing anything differently. I don't think the new law precludes state and local law enforcement from turning over immigrants, illegal immigrants, to the Border Patrol. But in the routine course of our duties, when we encounter illegal immigrants, and there are a variety of ways that that happens, especially out in the rural desert areas, once we determine that they are in fact illegal, we call the Border Patrol and turn them over to them. But if we were to enforce this law, what - you know, the people that passed this law are very quick to complain about government overstepping, which is one of their biggest complaints, and the second one is taxation. If we were to start enforcing this law instead of turning them over to the Border Patrol like we do now, we would have to put them the Pima County Jail. We would put the jail into a crisis overnight. We would have to overwhelm the rest of the criminal justice system locally here and send the taxpayers a huge bill, which is just nonsense, in my opinion. It's irresponsible of the legislature to do this, and it would be irresponsible of me to do it, as well. JUAN GONZALEZ : But now, your county also includes a significant section of border area right there in southern Arizona. What do you say to those people in Arizona and other parts of the country who say that something has to be done to control the numbers of people who continue to pour into the United Stated over the border from Mexico? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, I say to them just what I just finished saying to you. The federal government needs to do a lot more to stop illegal immigration. And one of the things they need to do is illegal reform. And I understand that, and they understand that, as well. This isn't rocket science. But a few years ago, when the Bush administration militarized the border with National Guardsmen, they put handcuffs on them. They weren't allowed to do anything related to illegal aliens. They couldn't even drive a bus that had illegal aliens in it. What we need to do is to put more people on the border to secure it, more technology and more agents. But we really need reform. JUAN GONZALEZ : And what about the issue that, within days, the legislature attempted to amend the bill they had just passed? What were the amendments that they made? And did it really have any substantive impact on the legislation, the original legislation? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, you know, it's going to take legal experts with better legal minds than my own to answer that question. But the change that they made late last - a week ago, Thursday night, before they adjourned, was they said you can't use race, ethnicity or country of origin solely as a reason for stop. AMY GOODMAN : Could you be in legal trouble for not enforcing the law, Sheriff? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, that's a question that the lawyers are going to have to address. But in my opinion, we are enforcing the law. If we're arresting the illegal aliens and turning them over to the Border Patrol, that seems to be a far better approach from every point of view than what the legislature has done to us. AMY GOODMAN : Your police chief, the Tucson police chief, Roberto Villaseñor, says he's worried about the impact of the law on investigations, with victims and witnesses who might be afraid to come forward. He said he's opposing the law's enactment, but he'll work to see that it's implemented fairly in Tucson. Are you working with Chief Villaseñor? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : All of law enforcement in the state, I think, is working together. There are some of us who are elected officials and are taking political stands. But aside from that, there's a lot of, in my opinion, unanimity as to the problems that this law is causing for law enforcement. It's an anti-law-enforcement law, in my opinion. AMY GOODMAN : How much support do you have from other aspects of law enforcement, other departments around the state? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : You know, the truth of the matter is, I don't really know. AMY GOODMAN : And have you spoken to the Governor, Governor Brewer? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : I have not. AMY GOODMAN : Well, Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, we want to thank you very much for being with us, sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, speaking to us from Tucson. Thanks so much for joining us.

AMY GOODMAN : Well, Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, we want to thank you very much for being with us, sheriff of Pima County, Arizona, speaking to us from Tucson. Thanks so much for joining us. SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Thanks for inviting me.\n\nSHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, you know, it's going to take legal experts with better legal minds than my own to answer that question. But the change that they made late last - a week ago, Thursday night, before they adjourned, was they said you can't use race, ethnicity or country of origin solely as a reason for stop. AMY GOODMAN : Could you be in legal trouble for not enforcing the law, Sheriff? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : Well, that's a question that the lawyers are going to have to address. But in my opinion, we are enforcing the law. If we're arresting the illegal aliens and turning them over to the Border Patrol, that seems to be a far better approach from every point of view than what the legislature has done to us. AMY GOODMAN : Your police chief, the Tucson police chief, Roberto Villaseñor, says he's worried about the impact of the law on investigations, with victims and witnesses who might be afraid to come forward. He said he's opposing the law's enactment, but he'll work to see that it's implemented fairly in Tucson. Are you working with Chief Villaseñor? SHERIFF CLARENCE DUPNIK : All of law enforcement in the state, I think, is working together. There are some of us who are elected officials and are taking political stands. But aside from that, there's a lot of, in my opinion, unanimity as to the problems that this law is causing for law enforcement. It's an anti-law-enforcement law, in my opinion.

In recent months, the governors of Illinois, Massachusetts and New York announced they are pulling out of the program, but now officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) say it is mandatory.

We host a debate on Secure Communities program with Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia, who helped ICE begin Secure Communities as a pilot program in Texas and is a member of the Secure Communities Task Force, and Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, one of the immigrant rights groups spearheading national organizing efforts against Secure Communities. [includes rush transcript]\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : As we just reported, the immigration enforcement program called Secure Communities is facing large protests from immigrant rights groups. Many are criticizing the Obama administration for unilaterally pushing ahead with the program, a controversial federal immigration enforcement policy that requires local police to forward fingerprints of every person they arrest to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. In recent months, the governors of Illinois, Massachusetts and New York have announced that they are pulling out of the program.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But now officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE , are saying the program is not voluntary, that local governments cannot opt out. This month, ICE sent a letter to local and state governors terminating all existing agreements with jurisdictions over the program. ICE said the agreements are no longer required to activate or operate Secure Communities.\n\nSome Latino groups rallied Tuesday in cities around the country against the White House's deportation policies, saying they may not support President Obama for reelection if he continues to deport record numbers of undocumented immigrants.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : In fact, opposition to Secure Communities has come from many sources. Last Friday, an editorial in the Los Angeles Times called on Obama to shelve Secure Communities, quote, \"The Obama administration should stop making matters worse by tinkering with a failed program to identify and deport dangerous illegal immigrants.\"\n\nAdvocates note that the majority of people deported in many cities and states are innocent or have minor infractions like driving without a license.\n\nCecilia Muñoz, the White House director of intergovernmental affairs, defended Secure Communities in a post Tuesday on the White House blog . Muñoz wrote, quote, \"Today more than half of all removals are people with criminal records. And among those removed who had no criminal records, more than two thirds were either apprehended as they crossed the border, were recent arrivals, or were repeat violators of immigration law, meaning that they had previously been deported. Those statistics matter.\"\n\nMuñoz went on to say, quote, \"While we have more work to do, the statistics demonstrate that the strategy DHS put in place is working. At the same time, the Administration has also been open and receptive to feedback from communities across the country.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Much of that feedback is directed toward a task force ICE has created to study possible reforms to Secure Communities. It includes 20 advocates and law enforcement officials. Last week, the task force held its first meeting in Dallas. Earlier this week, another meeting was held in Los Angeles. And as we just reported, Chicago hosted a meeting last night. All were met with hundreds of protesters.\n\nWell, to discuss and debate the question of whether ICE can reform Secure Communities so that it prioritizes the deportation of dangerous criminals or whether, as the L.A. Times said, Obama should shelve it, we're joined by two people who have direct experience with the program.\n\nHarris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia is the first Latino sheriff in Houston, Texas. He oversees the nation's third largest jail. [Edited for accuracy.] Sheriff Garcia is a member of the Secure Communities Task Force. He was meeting in Dallas last week.\n\nWe are also joined by Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, one of the immigrant rights groups spearheading national organizing efforts against Secure Communities.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Chris Newman, let's begin with you. Why are you spearheading this movement against Secure Communities? And then we'll have Sheriff Garcia respond.\n\nCHRIS NEWMAN : Well, indeed, Amy, thanks for having me. I'm not spearheading this movement. People like Fanny and the brave students that exercised their protest yesterday are. And those students yesterday should be applauded for their courage and for their integrity. And we could only hope that the President and his senior staff would exhibit the same courage and integrity that those students had, as they join, I think, a proud history of student movements that have made our country stronger and our laws more just.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And Sheriff Garcia, you've had direct experience with the program. Why is it necessary, given the absence, obviously, of a federal immigration policy that can deal adequately with the large numbers of undocumented we have in the country?\n\nSHERIFF ADRIAN GARCIA : Well, the Secure Communities program has demonstrated that-the way we are implementing it here in Harris County-that it's working. People who come through the county jail, having been arrested for a particular offense-probable cause, the element of probable cause has been met. People are being brought into the county jail. We process 100 percent of the inmates that come into the county jail through Secure Communities. We don't segregate for color of skin, color of eyes, color of hair, or anything of that nature. One hundred percent of the people go through this process. And as a result, we're finding a variety of folks of interest with questionable immigration status, and those individuals are then referred over to ICE for their ultimate determination. But it's working here, and we believe that we have a model program here.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And are you concerned or not that-obviously, when a person is arrested, they're still innocent until proven guilty in a trial, or unless they plead. Are you concerned that-the effect on the general population of knowing that you are cooperating to this extent, in terms of their interfacing with law enforcement?\n\nSHERIFF ADRIAN GARCIA : Well, I believe that on the ICE side of the process, that they have access to their hearings, and it is all a holistic process that occurs. If they're convicted for their crime here, ICE looks at that, once their entire local issue is resolved. But it seems to be working well with ICE handling their side of it. They're providing folks with the hearings, and they're giving folks an opportunity, on their side of the process, access to all of the opportunities that should be available to them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Chris Newman, your response?\n\nCHRIS NEWMAN : Well, I think the Secure Communities program is a demonstrable failure. In fact, the majority of people that have been identified and removed were not convicted of any serious crime. And I think the entanglement of local police in the enforcement of unjust federal immigration laws has diverted their attention. It's certainly contributed to a fear of immigrants and conflated immigrants with criminals. It's contributed to a fear, within the immigrant community, of police, which makes it, I think, more difficult for police and sheriffs to protect our communities.\n\nAnd the effects on all of our civil rights and civil liberties remain unknown, as, you know, I think it's now pretty clear that the racial profiling that occurs, and the violations of rights and due process, doesn't occur at the point when people are fingerprinted; it occurs at the point when people are stopped and investigated out in the street. And, you know, the country is replete with examples of local law enforcement agencies that have used these new expanded powers as a pretext to terrorize immigrant communities.\n\nAnd so, you know, I'm optimistic. I think that the program will be ended. I think that, as a policy matter, there's a sort of galvanized sense that it just doesn't make much sense. And I think that the lessons that we learn from the failure of Secure Communities, what has really become a Frankenstein, will be used, I think, to reform our immigration laws and fix what has already been a pretty broken intersection between immigration and criminal laws.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Well, three states have either suspended or refused to join Secure Communities, and all of them have cited public safety as one of their top concerns. Soon after Illinois Governor Pat Quinn tried to opt out in May, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo sent a letter to ICE in June, alerting them to the state's suspension of the program. He noted his administration had, quote, \"received numerous complaints and questions about the purpose and implementation\" of the program, and said his greatest concern is that, instead of targeting dangerous criminals, it is \"compromising public safety by deterring witnesses to crime and others from working with law enforcement.\" Two days later, Massachusetts said it would not agree to join the program, saying state law enforcement officials feared  the program was \"overly broad and may deter the reporting of criminal activity.\"\n\nChief Garcia, how do you respond? Do you have similar concerns? And what kind of recommendations will you be making as a member of the new task force, in terms of changing the existing Secure Communities program?\n\nSHERIFF ADRIAN GARCIA : Well, I'll tell you that I've got 25 years of law enforcement experience in this local community. And the concern of interaction with law enforcement goes way beyond the existence of Secure Communities. That's why we do a tremendous amount of outreach, encouraging folks to come forward to report crimes, to participate, to be witnesses. And I believe that that continues to be the case. People are making the right decisions for the right reasons, to help us take other individuals off the streets who are dangerous and a harm to their communities, coupled with the fact that the criminals that are-that have questionable immigration status, tend to victimize immigrants themselves. And so, that is why we have to continue to work together as a community. It's what I advocate.\n\nAnd the recommendations to ICE is really not to ICE , it's to Congress. Let's get moving on working and resolving the laws on immigration. And let's make sure we come up with something that is practical for all communities across this country to use and to implement and give the communities something that they can count on.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to play a comment from David Martin, who recently retired from his position as deputy general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security. He now serves [on] ICE's Secure Communities Task Force. He spoke about the balance between the rights of states and local jurisdictions and the power of the federal government on immigration enforcement. This is what he said on Wednesday on The Kojo Nnamdi Show .\n\nDAVID MARTIN : Well, I think it's quite appropriate for the federal government to say that its priorities are going to prevail in the area of immigration. Now, those need to be wise priorities, and there's been a lot of work on that front to try to deal with that. But I'd just like to challenge people in the immigrant advocacy community who say that, with regard to Secure Communities, ICE and Department of Homeland Security have to defer to the states. If you really mean that, then they need to defer to the states-states like Arizona or Alabama or Georgia that have adopted very harsh laws. The federal government, I think quite appropriately, has sued a couple of those states to block that and say no. Immigration-we want to cooperate-the federal government wants to cooperate with state and locals, but the federal government is the one that sets the standards and the priorities. And that-if that applies to Arizona, it has to apply to Illinois, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was David Martin, who recently retired from the position as deputy general counsel for Department of Homeland Security, now serves on ICE's Secure Communities Task Force, speaking on Kojo Nnamdi Show on WAMU , NPR station in Washington. Chris Newman, your response?\n\nCHRIS NEWMAN : Well, I mean, that's an extraordinarily-just an intellectually dishonest thing for him to say. And I'm shocked, frankly, that a professor of law would be, I just think, very dishonest. He knows full well that the laws do not support that conclusion. It may be a clever talking point, but I think that that kind of statement shows that he's more interested in messaging and defending a policy that he helped construct while he was in DHS . And I, frankly, think he should resign from the task force.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Sheriff Garcia, you mentioned that you believe that it's imperative for Congress to move forward on immigration reform. There's another sheriff in your part of the country, in the Southwest, Joe Arpaio, who's made a national name for himself in the way that he deals with the immigration issues. What do you think, in Congress's reform of immigration, are the key-the key reforms that are needed?\n\nSHERIFF ADRIAN GARCIA : Well, I think the key reforms is that you have to look at the whole-the entire immigration policy together. Look, I'm the son of immigrant parents. I'm the only American born in my family. My family came here similar to Fanny's concerns. They came here to this country to work, work hard, play by the rules. But they waited in line. They went through the application process. They requested access into this country. My father was a bracero ; he was a guest worker. Those are elements that have to be brought into this process, so that the enforcement side, which-we're a country of rule of law, and we have to have that side of it, as well. But we also have to address how we want people to come in. We have to address how people that are here get their situations resolved. We have to resolve the issue of children who were brought here, like Fanny and others. And we have to resolve the issue of kids like others who are born here but have parents who have questionable immigration statuses. Plus, we have to also address the issue for why nationals from other parts of the world feel compelled to come to this country and leave their homelands. That is another issue that has to be addressed by Congress. So, that is the totality of what is required, the leadership that's required by Congress to fix this, so that we can fix it not for the short term, but for the long term.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Monday night, over 300 people walked out of a community forum in Los Angeles after demanding that Secure Communities task force members resign. Let me play a clip from that meeting, when one of the protesters addresses members of the task force after several people gave testimony about how they feared deportation of their family members and called for an end to the program.\n\nPROTESTER : We welcome you. We welcome you to Los Angeles. We welcome you to our communities. And people have told you their stories with humility and respect. And now, we come here to you and ask you, humbly and with respect, will you resign from this task force? Will you resign and stand with us and call for a termination of this program?\n\nPROTESTERS : Resign from this task force! Resign from this task force! Resign from this task force!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was from the meeting in Los Angeles. Chris Newman, it's where you are, one of the organizers of the day laborers organization. Talk about this call for task force members to resign rather than participate in developing a plan to reform S-Comm, Secure Communities.\n\nCHRIS NEWMAN : Well, you know, Secure Communities is a program that has been built on lies since its very naming, since its inception in October of 2008. DHS has consistently lied about the program to state partners and to police and sheriffs, like Sheriff Garcia. And frankly, they've lost all credibility with the American public. And the task force itself is just more-more lies. And I think there are earnest participation from task force members who would like to, you know, identify problems with Secure Communities, but it's falling on deaf ears. DHS , I think, has used the task force as a political gesture to undermine the policy choices of governors in New York, Illinois and Massachusetts, and other governors, frankly, who wanted out of the program.\n\nAnd the problem is that the task force puts people into an uncomfortable position, of people who understand that there are problems with Secure Communities-they all of a sudden get put in the position of actually defending the program, like Sheriff Garcia, I think, is in the unenviable position right now. And I think that that puts him, frankly, and the side of history with people like Sheriff Joe Arpaio and others like him who have continued to try to treat immigrants as criminals and not really stood up to the fact that our immigration laws are unjust. And there needs to, I think, be courage on the part of the task force members, and they need to stand, I think, with the growing consensus that this is just a failed program. And I think more and more people are asking people to resign off of what is perceived to be, by everyone, a sham effort by DHS , frankly just more of a cover-up for the way in which they've botched this program since its inception.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, of course, we will continue to cover this issue. I want to thank you, Chris Newman, legal director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network in Los Angeles, and Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia, first Latino sheriff in Houston, Texas, oversees the nation's third largest jail, helped ICE begin Secure Communities as a pilot program in Texas. Sheriff Garcia is a member of DHS's Secure Communities Task Force.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Now he could be facing a federal investigation for civil rights abuses and a trial on charges of racially profiling Latinos. He's also been accused of focusing on immigration enforcement at the expense of other law enforcement duties. [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The man who calls himself \"America's toughest sheriff\" could be facing a federal investigation for possible civil rights abuses and a trial on charges of racially profiling Latinos. The chairpersons of four House committees called on Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano last Friday to investigate allegations of misconduct against Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County in Arizona. Earlier this month, in a move the New York Times called a \"degrading spectacle,\" Sheriff Arpaio forced 200 shackled prisoners to march through the streets of Phoenix from a local jail to his infamous tent city that's surrounded by an electric fence. Many accused the sheriff of pulling a publicity stunt to promote his new reality television show on Fox, Smile, You're Under Arrest! At a news conference after the march, this is how Arpaio responded to questions about why he was humiliating prisoners. SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : Well, if you remember, if you've been around, about two years ago we marched about a thousand people in just their pink underwear from one jail to the other. So why should I keep this secret, because it will never be kept secret, if I open this tent city? In about two minutes, the whole world will know about it anyway. So I have nothing to hide. I have an open-door policy. I'm facing you right now. I'm telling you our policy. I have nothing to hide. I don't sneak people in. The media constantly comes through these tents, from all over the world. We've had presidential candidates, four of them, running for president, that visited the tents. AMY GOODMAN : That clip courtesy of A.J. Alexander. In their strongly worded letter, Congress members John Conyers, Zoe Lofgren, Jerrold Nadler and Bobby Scott accuse the sheriff of \"blatant disregard for the rights of Hispanic residents.\" They say Latinos in Phoenix, citizens and non-citizens alike, \"feel under siege\" because of the sheriff's raids. In an interview with the East Valley Tribune newspaper last April, Sheriff Arpaio defended himself against mounting criticism of his actions. SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : We do know there's many illegals in this county that have already been designated criminals. Just by coming here, they are criminals. Everybody forgets that. Illegal means that you've done something wrong, you're illegal. But that goes by the wayside. See, nobody talks about that. They call me Nazi, and they have KKK . They have my picture next to Hitler, all these demonstrators. That's alright. I can take it. But, you know, that is a little racist, too, against me. But they want to do it, let them do it. AMY GOODMAN : Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The sheriff's tactics of public humiliation have come under greater fire since Maricopa County entered into what is known as a Section 287(g) agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement allows local law enforcement agencies to perform immigration enforcement functions. Last year, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon criticized Sheriff Arpaio for focusing on immigration enforcement at the expense of 40,000 outstanding felony arrest warrants. The letter from Congressman Conyers and others urges Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano to review and possibly terminate Maricopa County's 287(g) agreements. I'm joined right now by two guests in Phoenix, Arizona. Ryan Gabrielson is a reporter with the East Valley Tribune . He's just won the 2008 George Polk Award for Justice Reporting, along with Paul Giblin, for their five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio called \"Reasonable Doubt.\" Salvador Reza is with us, as well, a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix that grew out of the spate of arrests and deportations under Sheriff Arpaio in 2007. He's part of a large group of organizations calling for the national demonstration in Phoenix next Saturday against 287(g) agreements. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! President Obama is there, as well, today. He is going to be signing legislation there. And he will be accompanied by the Homeland Security director, Janet Napolitano, who is the former governor of Arizona, who has worked very closely with the sheriff. Ryan Gabrielson, first of all, congratulations on your George Polk Award for this series. Can you talk about the latest controversy that involves the sheriff? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nEarlier this month, in a move the New York Times called a \"degrading spectacle,\" Sheriff Arpaio forced 200 shackled prisoners to march through the streets of Phoenix from a local jail to his infamous tent city that's surrounded by an electric fence. Many accused the sheriff of pulling a publicity stunt to promote his new reality television show on Fox, Smile, You're Under Arrest! At a news conference after the march, this is how Arpaio responded to questions about why he was humiliating prisoners. SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : Well, if you remember, if you've been around, about two years ago we marched about a thousand people in just their pink underwear from one jail to the other. So why should I keep this secret, because it will never be kept secret, if I open this tent city? In about two minutes, the whole world will know about it anyway. So I have nothing to hide. I have an open-door policy. I'm facing you right now. I'm telling you our policy. I have nothing to hide. I don't sneak people in. The media constantly comes through these tents, from all over the world. We've had presidential candidates, four of them, running for president, that visited the tents. AMY GOODMAN : That clip courtesy of A.J. Alexander. In their strongly worded letter, Congress members John Conyers, Zoe Lofgren, Jerrold Nadler and Bobby Scott accuse the sheriff of \"blatant disregard for the rights of Hispanic residents.\" They say Latinos in Phoenix, citizens and non-citizens alike, \"feel under siege\" because of the sheriff's raids. In an interview with the East Valley Tribune newspaper last April, Sheriff Arpaio defended himself against mounting criticism of his actions. SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : We do know there's many illegals in this county that have already been designated criminals. Just by coming here, they are criminals. Everybody forgets that. Illegal means that you've done something wrong, you're illegal. But that goes by the wayside. See, nobody talks about that. They call me Nazi, and they have KKK . They have my picture next to Hitler, all these demonstrators. That's alright. I can take it. But, you know, that is a little racist, too, against me. But they want to do it, let them do it. AMY GOODMAN : Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The sheriff's tactics of public humiliation have come under greater fire since Maricopa County entered into what is known as a Section 287(g) agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement allows local law enforcement agencies to perform immigration enforcement functions. Last year, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon criticized Sheriff Arpaio for focusing on immigration enforcement at the expense of 40,000 outstanding felony arrest warrants. The letter from Congressman Conyers and others urges Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano to review and possibly terminate Maricopa County's 287(g) agreements. I'm joined right now by two guests in Phoenix, Arizona. Ryan Gabrielson is a reporter with the East Valley Tribune . He's just won the 2008 George Polk Award for Justice Reporting, along with Paul Giblin, for their five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio called \"Reasonable Doubt.\" Salvador Reza is with us, as well, a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix that grew out of the spate of arrests and deportations under Sheriff Arpaio in 2007. He's part of a large group of organizations calling for the national demonstration in Phoenix next Saturday against 287(g) agreements. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! President Obama is there, as well, today. He is going to be signing legislation there. And he will be accompanied by the Homeland Security director, Janet Napolitano, who is the former governor of Arizona, who has worked very closely with the sheriff. Ryan Gabrielson, first of all, congratulations on your George Polk Award for this series. Can you talk about the latest controversy that involves the sheriff? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic .

And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nAt a news conference after the march, this is how Arpaio responded to questions about why he was humiliating prisoners. SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : Well, if you remember, if you've been around, about two years ago we marched about a thousand people in just their pink underwear from one jail to the other. So why should I keep this secret, because it will never be kept secret, if I open this tent city? In about two minutes, the whole world will know about it anyway. So I have nothing to hide. I have an open-door policy. I'm facing you right now. I'm telling you our policy. I have nothing to hide. I don't sneak people in. The media constantly comes through these tents, from all over the world. We've had presidential candidates, four of them, running for president, that visited the tents. AMY GOODMAN : That clip courtesy of A.J. Alexander. In their strongly worded letter, Congress members John Conyers, Zoe Lofgren, Jerrold Nadler and Bobby Scott accuse the sheriff of \"blatant disregard for the rights of Hispanic residents.\" They say Latinos in Phoenix, citizens and non-citizens alike, \"feel under siege\" because of the sheriff's raids. In an interview with the East Valley Tribune newspaper last April, Sheriff Arpaio defended himself against mounting criticism of his actions. SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : We do know there's many illegals in this county that have already been designated criminals. Just by coming here, they are criminals. Everybody forgets that. Illegal means that you've done something wrong, you're illegal. But that goes by the wayside. See, nobody talks about that. They call me Nazi, and they have KKK . They have my picture next to Hitler, all these demonstrators. That's alright. I can take it. But, you know, that is a little racist, too, against me. But they want to do it, let them do it. AMY GOODMAN : Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The sheriff's tactics of public humiliation have come under greater fire since Maricopa County entered into what is known as a Section 287(g) agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement allows local law enforcement agencies to perform immigration enforcement functions. Last year, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon criticized Sheriff Arpaio for focusing on immigration enforcement at the expense of 40,000 outstanding felony arrest warrants. The letter from Congressman Conyers and others urges Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano to review and possibly terminate Maricopa County's 287(g) agreements. I'm joined right now by two guests in Phoenix, Arizona. Ryan Gabrielson is a reporter with the East Valley Tribune . He's just won the 2008 George Polk Award for Justice Reporting, along with Paul Giblin, for their five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio called \"Reasonable Doubt.\" Salvador Reza is with us, as well, a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix that grew out of the spate of arrests and deportations under Sheriff Arpaio in 2007. He's part of a large group of organizations calling for the national demonstration in Phoenix next Saturday against 287(g) agreements. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! President Obama is there, as well, today. He is going to be signing legislation there. And he will be accompanied by the Homeland Security director, Janet Napolitano, who is the former governor of Arizona, who has worked very closely with the sheriff. Ryan Gabrielson, first of all, congratulations on your George Polk Award for this series. Can you talk about the latest controversy that involves the sheriff? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona.

But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine.

Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor.

A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide.

And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nSHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : Well, if you remember, if you've been around, about two years ago we marched about a thousand people in just their pink underwear from one jail to the other. So why should I keep this secret, because it will never be kept secret, if I open this tent city? In about two minutes, the whole world will know about it anyway. So I have nothing to hide. I have an open-door policy. I'm facing you right now. I'm telling you our policy. I have nothing to hide. I don't sneak people in. The media constantly comes through these tents, from all over the world. We've had presidential candidates, four of them, running for president, that visited the tents.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That clip courtesy of A.J. Alexander. In their strongly worded letter, Congress members John Conyers, Zoe Lofgren, Jerrold Nadler and Bobby Scott accuse the sheriff of \"blatant disregard for the rights of Hispanic residents.\" They say Latinos in Phoenix, citizens and non-citizens alike, \"feel under siege\" because of the sheriff's raids. In an interview with the East Valley Tribune newspaper last April, Sheriff Arpaio defended himself against mounting criticism of his actions. SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : We do know there's many illegals in this county that have already been designated criminals. Just by coming here, they are criminals. Everybody forgets that. Illegal means that you've done something wrong, you're illegal. But that goes by the wayside. See, nobody talks about that. They call me Nazi, and they have KKK . They have my picture next to Hitler, all these demonstrators. That's alright. I can take it. But, you know, that is a little racist, too, against me. But they want to do it, let them do it. AMY GOODMAN : Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The sheriff's tactics of public humiliation have come under greater fire since Maricopa County entered into what is known as a Section 287(g) agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement allows local law enforcement agencies to perform immigration enforcement functions. Last year, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon criticized Sheriff Arpaio for focusing on immigration enforcement at the expense of 40,000 outstanding felony arrest warrants. The letter from Congressman Conyers and others urges Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano to review and possibly terminate Maricopa County's 287(g) agreements. I'm joined right now by two guests in Phoenix, Arizona. Ryan Gabrielson is a reporter with the East Valley Tribune . He's just won the 2008 George Polk Award for Justice Reporting, along with Paul Giblin, for their five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio called \"Reasonable Doubt.\" Salvador Reza is with us, as well, a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix that grew out of the spate of arrests and deportations under Sheriff Arpaio in 2007. He's part of a large group of organizations calling for the national demonstration in Phoenix next Saturday against 287(g) agreements. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! President Obama is there, as well, today. He is going to be signing legislation there. And he will be accompanied by the Homeland Security director, Janet Napolitano, who is the former governor of Arizona, who has worked very closely with the sheriff. Ryan Gabrielson, first of all, congratulations on your George Polk Award for this series. Can you talk about the latest controversy that involves the sheriff? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that.

He's just won the 2008 George Polk Award for Justice Reporting, along with Paul Giblin, for their five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio called \"Reasonable Doubt.\" Salvador Reza is with us, as well, a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix that grew out of the spate of arrests and deportations under Sheriff Arpaio in 2007. He's part of a large group of organizations calling for the national demonstration in Phoenix next Saturday against 287(g) agreements. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! President Obama is there, as well, today. He is going to be signing legislation there. And he will be accompanied by the Homeland Security director, Janet Napolitano, who is the former governor of Arizona, who has worked very closely with the sheriff. Ryan Gabrielson, first of all, congratulations on your George Polk Award for this series. Can you talk about the latest controversy that involves the sheriff? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nIn an interview with the East Valley Tribune newspaper last April, Sheriff Arpaio defended himself against mounting criticism of his actions. SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : We do know there's many illegals in this county that have already been designated criminals. Just by coming here, they are criminals. Everybody forgets that. Illegal means that you've done something wrong, you're illegal. But that goes by the wayside. See, nobody talks about that. They call me Nazi, and they have KKK . They have my picture next to Hitler, all these demonstrators. That's alright. I can take it. But, you know, that is a little racist, too, against me. But they want to do it, let them do it. AMY GOODMAN : Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The sheriff's tactics of public humiliation have come under greater fire since Maricopa County entered into what is known as a Section 287(g) agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement allows local law enforcement agencies to perform immigration enforcement functions. Last year, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon criticized Sheriff Arpaio for focusing on immigration enforcement at the expense of 40,000 outstanding felony arrest warrants. The letter from Congressman Conyers and others urges Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano to review and possibly terminate Maricopa County's 287(g) agreements. I'm joined right now by two guests in Phoenix, Arizona. Ryan Gabrielson is a reporter with the East Valley Tribune .

We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nSHERIFF JOE ARPAIO : We do know there's many illegals in this county that have already been designated criminals. Just by coming here, they are criminals. Everybody forgets that. Illegal means that you've done something wrong, you're illegal. But that goes by the wayside. See, nobody talks about that. They call me Nazi, and they have KKK . They have my picture next to Hitler, all these demonstrators. That's alright. I can take it. But, you know, that is a little racist, too, against me. But they want to do it, let them do it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The sheriff's tactics of public humiliation have come under greater fire since Maricopa County entered into what is known as a Section 287(g) agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement allows local law enforcement agencies to perform immigration enforcement functions. Last year, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon criticized Sheriff Arpaio for focusing on immigration enforcement at the expense of 40,000 outstanding felony arrest warrants. The letter from Congressman Conyers and others urges Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano to review and possibly terminate Maricopa County's 287(g) agreements. I'm joined right now by two guests in Phoenix, Arizona. Ryan Gabrielson is a reporter with the East Valley Tribune . He's just won the 2008 George Polk Award for Justice Reporting, along with Paul Giblin, for their five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio called \"Reasonable Doubt.\" Salvador Reza is with us, as well, a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix that grew out of the spate of arrests and deportations under Sheriff Arpaio in 2007. He's part of a large group of organizations calling for the national demonstration in Phoenix next Saturday against 287(g) agreements. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! President Obama is there, as well, today. He is going to be signing legislation there. And he will be accompanied by the Homeland Security director, Janet Napolitano, who is the former governor of Arizona, who has worked very closely with the sheriff. Ryan Gabrielson, first of all, congratulations on your George Polk Award for this series. Can you talk about the latest controversy that involves the sheriff? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work.

And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nThe sheriff's tactics of public humiliation have come under greater fire since Maricopa County entered into what is known as a Section 287(g) agreement with the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement allows local law enforcement agencies to perform immigration enforcement functions. Last year, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon criticized Sheriff Arpaio for focusing on immigration enforcement at the expense of 40,000 outstanding felony arrest warrants. The letter from Congressman Conyers and others urges Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano to review and possibly terminate Maricopa County's 287(g) agreements. I'm joined right now by two guests in Phoenix, Arizona. Ryan Gabrielson is a reporter with the East Valley Tribune . He's just won the 2008 George Polk Award for Justice Reporting, along with Paul Giblin, for their five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio called \"Reasonable Doubt.\" Salvador Reza is with us, as well, a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix that grew out of the spate of arrests and deportations under Sheriff Arpaio in 2007. He's part of a large group of organizations calling for the national demonstration in Phoenix next Saturday against 287(g) agreements. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! President Obama is there, as well, today. He is going to be signing legislation there. And he will be accompanied by the Homeland Security director, Janet Napolitano, who is the former governor of Arizona, who has worked very closely with the sheriff. Ryan Gabrielson, first of all, congratulations on your George Polk Award for this series. Can you talk about the latest controversy that involves the sheriff? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite.

A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed.

AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! President Obama is there, as well, today. He is going to be signing legislation there. And he will be accompanied by the Homeland Security director, Janet Napolitano, who is the former governor of Arizona, who has worked very closely with the sheriff. Ryan Gabrielson, first of all, congratulations on your George Polk Award for this series. Can you talk about the latest controversy that involves the sheriff? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations.

SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nPresident Obama is there, as well, today. He is going to be signing legislation there. And he will be accompanied by the Homeland Security director, Janet Napolitano, who is the former governor of Arizona, who has worked very closely with the sheriff. Ryan Gabrielson, first of all, congratulations on your George Polk Award for this series. Can you talk about the latest controversy that involves the sheriff? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements.

And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide.

And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them.

But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nRYAN GABRIELSON : Well, the latest controversy is simply sort of stemming from the two years worth of controversy since the sheriff's office began doing its real crackdown on illegal immigration. And the new investigations that are being called for seem to be sort of a fresh approach to what the FBI apparently - there's a lot of evidence -- was doing last year in response to the Phoenix mayor's request for a federal investigation. Lots of people that we've talked to have said that federal agents, FBI agents, have been doing interviews for quite some time, potentially building a case concerning civil rights infractions. This simply would be a new approach from different agencies, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and from the Attorney General's office itself. AMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes.

Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about the latest news, Salvador Reza, the latest controversy, and how your organizations came together. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. In 2007, Sheriff Arpaio said for ICE -trained sheriffs to basically patrol an area under control of a Roger Sensing, which is a private individual. So this private individual was utilizing them to actually scour the neighborhoods. He would call in the license plates of people that were picked up for day labor. And basically the sheriffs would go and stop them and then start interrogating everybody. He deported over a hundred people like that. So, out of that, we started a series of demonstrations against Pruitt. But now, since then, he has done a series of sweeps every so often, like every two months or so, where he goes into the Latino neighborhoods and basically intimidates, terrorizes and basically destroys business in the area while he's there. Well, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response.

And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine.

AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nWell, the latest stunt, media stunt, by Sheriff Arpaio was parading 240 or so prisoners from one facility to the other, which is now the tent city. It's not that far, but he called all the media to make a spectacle of the situation, and basically segregating by alienation, by national origin, and by color, a whole set of inmates, which is actually a violation of the Constitution. But on top of that, he said it was to facilitate visit by the lawyers and by the Mexican consulate or the consulate of other country. But what happened, in essence, he actually took away days. Now they only can visit them three days. So, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations.

Stay with us.

And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nSo, you know, he's constantly lying and basically putting himself on the public eye and basically dividing the whole community into pro- and anti-Arpaio forces. And he's utilizing the 287(g) agreements so that he can basically go after gardeners, after corn vendors, after, you know, maids, and basically intimidating. Now he's interrogating the whole board of supervisors, county board of supervisors, and accusing them of violating employer sanctions. So he's out of control. And I think investigation is due. Not only investigation, they should freeze the 287(g) agreements with Sheriff Arpaio until, you know, this gets resolved. Janet Napolitano doesn't seem to want to do that so far. I hope she changes her mind. RYAN GABRIELSON : It's true, the 287(g) agreement -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country.

And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them.

When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area.

AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson -- RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, yes. AMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails.

There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime.

AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - the reporter with the East Valley Tribune . RYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history?

And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nRYAN GABRIELSON : - just distinctly changed the nature of the sheriff's operations. Throughout 2006, when they first began this, they were scouring the rural roadways where human smugglers would use to get in and out of Maricopa County. Once they got the federal pact, they all of a sudden had 160 federal agents, or their deputies that were cross-designated with all the powers of Immigration agents. They started launching large-scale crackdowns in Hispanic neighborhoods with zero evidence of actual criminal activity, sending out the SWAT team, the K9 teams, you know, hundreds of members of their volunteer posse, to just target day laborers. So - and that's something that's continued ever since they got the federal agreement. AMY GOODMAN : And what about this issue of whether Janet Napolitano, the Arizona governor, can deal with Sheriff Arpaio in the way that the Congress members and community groups are demanding, given her history? I'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that.

SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know.

And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nI'm looking at a piece, in addition to your pieces, Ryan Gabrielson, by Tom Zoellner, who formerly wrote for the Arizona Republic . And he - the piece is called \"Janet Napolitano's Embarrassing History with Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\" And among the things he says, \"The public devours it, [and] Arpaio has consistently enjoyed some of the highest approval ratings of any elected official in Arizona [(Maricopa County includes Phoenix)]. That inmates have a way of getting killed in Sheriff Joe's jails, costing Maricopa County millions of dollars in lawsuits, has not dimmed his star. Nor has a federal judge's order that he provide a constitutionally mandated minimum level of food and health care, an order that said Arpaio had inflicted 'needless suffering and deterioration' on the mentally ill.\" He goes on to say, \"More than a decade ago, Napolitano was in a position to help curb Arpaio's excesses. As a U.S. attorney in 1995, she was put in charge of [a] Justice Department investigation into atrocious conditions in Arpaio's 'tent city.' Napolitano carried out her task with what can best be described as reluctance, going out of her way to protect Arpaio from flak almost before the probe had started.\" She told the Associated Press, \"We're doing this with the complete cooperation of the sheriff.\" She said, \"We run a strict jail but a safe jail, and I haven't heard from anyone who thinks that this is a bad thing.\" He writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine.

Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own.

And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nHe writes, \"'Anyone'? Maybe Napolitano needed to get out of her office a little more. \"The Justice Department's final report, issued about two years later, confirmed a list of disgraces, including excessive use of force, gratuitous use of pepper spray and 'restraint chairs' (since blamed for at least three inmate deaths), and hog-tying and beating of inmates. It also said Arpaio's staffing was 'below levels needed for safety and humane operations.'\" Ryan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear.

And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nRyan Gabrielson, this is a good chance to go into the history of the sheriff, something that you've done comprehensively in this five-part series. We're going to break and come back. We're speaking with Ryan Gabrielson, a reporter with the East Valley Tribune who has won the 2008 George Polk Award, just announced yesterday, and Salvador Reza, who is a member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona, where President Obama is today. Stay with us. [break] AMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime.

And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Our guests are Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, Arizona; Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter of the East Valley Tribune , who has done a five-part series on the controversial Sheriff Arpaio. Now Congress members are calling for a federal investigation into his tactics. Among the things he has done, parading prisoners through the streets of Phoenix in their prison stripes, making them wear only pink underwear. He's been charged with not giving them enough food. But, Ryan Gabrielson, why don't you go through the history, what you found? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark.

RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nRYAN GABRIELSON : Well, it's been a long sixteen years. Joe Arpaio served four terms now, and he's just elected to a fifth, so he's going to be around for a while long. He jokes that they'll have to carry him out in a box. He's a master showman. And so, it's always - you know, from the pink underwear that you mentioned to tent city, putting a big no vacancy sign that's always lit up over tent city that's letting them - while a lot of jails are overflowing and people and criminals are being let go early, he will always make more room, regardless of what constraints he might theoretically have. And that's always played very well with the public, regardless of what else is actually going on within the sheriff's office. His popularity has been, you know, traditionally in the 70s and 80 percentiles. It's much lower these days. He's in the solid 50 to 60 percent, but, you know, which would be bad only by Arpaio standards. Our investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates.

But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nOur investigation wanted to really take a look behind the front that everybody covers constantly, you know, what's what - we're all being called out to bring out cameras to watch inmates being paraded around.  We wanted to find out how is he going about conducting his immigration operations, who is he arresting, what are they being charged with, what was the probable cause, and what impact is it having on everything else that they're supposed to be doing. They're the police department for all of unincorporated Maricopa County and all these small towns, 300,000 people in all, in which they are, you know, the first and last line of defense on all kinds of violent crimes. So we wanted to find out, are they actually responding to those needs, as they ramp up and evolve into an immigration agency, which started in 2006? And what we found was the problems in the jails have been well documented over the years, but no one had really focused on the main - one of the main core jobs of police work. And we found that starting in 2006, after the immigration enforcement began, response times just got dramatically slower on the most serious emergency calls. Arrest rates plummeted from ten percent, which is fairly standard nationally, to around three percent. And in some cases, violent crimes, particularly sexual assaults, we found dozens of them had not been investigated at all and had, in fact, been ignored in the areas where the heaviest immigration enforcement work was being done. AMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador.

RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go to the issue, for example, of deaths and lack of food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, can you talk about that? Charged with not giving prisoners enough food. RYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants.

And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nRYAN GABRIELSON : Oh, in his jails. Well, I mean, there's been multiple, multiple deaths, painstakingly reported by us, The Republic and in other papers, particularly Phoenix New Times , detailing just the level of abuse and negligence in supervising prisoners. There was just recently, last year, another beating death that was captured on camera. And the food situation is simply - is one that Arpaio has actually used as a point of his - part of his publicity machine, serving them green bologna, just the bare minimum, which in a state like Arizona, traditionally, has played very well with the idea tough on crime. Joe Arpaio creates visual ways to show that he's being tough on crime, like green bologna, pink underwear and no vacancy signs. AMY GOODMAN : And the pink underwear, where were they forced to wear this? RYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response.

And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nRYAN GABRIELSON : That's in jail. The storyline that he told is that prisoners were stealing the regular white underwear. And so, in order to curb that, he made it all pink, so it would be less desirable. And it created a sensation, and he started selling his pink underwear, and all that sort has become part of his trademark. AMY GOODMAN : And raiding the offices of the Phoenix New Times , Ryan Gabrielson? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, actually, there was a - they didn't even actually go to their offices. They went to the homes of the two publishers for Phoenix New Times , which - there was an investigation being conducted into a case where New Times published Joe Arpaio's home address in its paper and online. And Arizona has a kind of interesting law where you're not allowed to publish online the address of law enforcement. And so, the sheriff had been pushing our county attorney to do an investigation and prosecute the case. Over the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA.

AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nOver the course of that, it sort of snowballed to the point where they - New Times received these hugely broad subpoenas for basically every bit of information about readers, reporter notes, etc., just breathtaking subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas. And they were supposed to remain sort of - you know, they weren't supposed to publish anything about it, and they felt that they had a need, that people needed to know what was going on with this investigation, so they published all the details about these subpoenas. And then, that night, after the newspaper came out, sheriff's deputies in plain clothes showed up at the homes of these two publishers and arrested them. SALVADOR REZA : With cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : Yes. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that.

A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, repeat that. SALVADOR REZA : With cars that had Mexican license plates, sheriff cars with Mexican license plates. RYAN GABRIELSON : The sheriff's offices has a division called the Selective Enforcement Unit that handles those types of things, not regular police work, but more internal control of that sort. AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio?

And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson, you've been writing in your part five of your Tribune piece that won the George Polk, \"Why No One Is Willing to Hold Arpaio Accountable.\" And I'd like you to talk, for example, about Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon, the highest elected official to publicly go against Arpaio's sweeps, what happened to him, what he said, and then right on up to, well, the governor, who has now become the Homeland Security chief, Janet Napolitano, who's back in Arizona today with President Obama in Phoenix. RYAN GABRIELSON : Traditionally, Joe Arpaio has been one of the most popular and, therefore, most powerful politicians in the state of Arizona. And to go up against Joe was - brought significant risks. When the mayor of Phoenix, Phil Gordon, spoke out against him last year, it didn't go without a response. Not only was, of course, Arpaio blasting Gordon in various media outlets, he launched an investigation of - Gordon had detailed a complaint, a racial profiling allegation, against sheriff's deputies from somebody in his staff. And so, the sheriff's office launched an internal affairs investigation of some sort to determine if there was any veracity to that complaint and, in the process, requested -- I think it was tens of thousands of pages of internal correspondence, email, the mayor's email, for, I think, the past year or so, theoretically to ascertain the source of this complaint and all the details about it. But it was looked at as a fishing expedition to try to find dirt on the mayor. AMY GOODMAN : Salvador Reza, Janet Napolitano, who is a close adviser now, of course, to President Obama as the head of Homeland Security? SALVADOR REZA : Sheriff Arpaio is actually the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is basically a prosecutor. She is pro-law enforcement, and which is fine. But the problem with it is that now they have criminal [inaudible] -- AMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know.

And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that. SALVADOR REZA : One of the things that we haven't been mentioning is that Sheriff Arpaio has been utilized by United for a Sovereign America and other groups that are nativist groups that actually go and - go, for example, to four or five businesses in an area, and then those four or five businesses ask Joe to come in, while seventy or eighty of the other businesses in the area don't even want him, because they know what's going to happen to them. So with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Salvador Reza and Ryan Gabrielson. We seem to have lost the satellite connection at this moment. Ryan Gabrielson just won the George Polk Award for his five-part series on Sheriff Arpaio. Salvador Reza, a longtime activist in Phoenix, he's a member of the Puente movement. Continue, Salvador. SALVADOR REZA : Yes. Well, Janet Napolitano is actually - Sheriff Arpaio is the biggest black eye for Janet Napolitano. Janet Napolitano is a prosecutor. But the problem with it is that they have criminalized our work now. To be here to seek work or to be here in the United States undocumented is actually just a civil penalty. Yet, you know, they keep on stressing the criminality of it. The 287(g) agreements were brought in by Janet Napolitano, and she was the one that actually went and interceded for Sheriff Arpaio and vouched for him to get the 287(g) agreements. Now she wants to expand the 287(g) agreement nationally, but if they do that, then the same thing that happened to Arizona is going to happen nationally, because you're going to have access to doing immigration work for a lot of like little county sheriffs that don't necessarily understand the complexity of modern migrations. And on top of that, what is happening, Arizona has basically become like a ghost town, because no business comes here anymore, because they're afraid that Sheriff Arpaio might come and raid them. A lot of companies have left Arizona to Mexico, to Canada, or to other states, basically because nobody is willing to risk it, nobody's willing to come and invest in Arizona. And if this goes nationally, this is going to affect not only Arizona, but nationally it's going to affect the entire United States. And under the climate that we're - economic climate we're in right now, we don't need that right now. I hope Obama actually looks at what happened to Arizona before they unleash the plans that Janet Napolitano has for the entire country. RYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide.

And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore. The question is whether she's willing to undertake a politically challenging investigation that could result in the sheriff's office losing its -- SALVADOR REZA : 287. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nRYAN GABRIELSON : And 287(g) actually is already, to a certain -- AMY GOODMAN : Ryan Gabrielson. RYAN GABRIELSON : -- to a certain extent, nationwide. Florida and Alabama were two of the first places where these type of pacts were set up. But no one does it quite like Joe Arpaio. He's got the largest contingent of these officers in the country. It's 160. Nobody else has anywhere near that many. And what's sort of happening right now is there's dozens of other state and local police departments that are waiting, have applied, to get 287(g) agreements to do this type of work on their own. And it is complicated work. It is difficult. And it requires - you know, they get five weeks of training, but sometimes that training doesn't necessarily either sink in, or it doesn't actually work its way into the field. One of the things we found in our series with the sheriff is in their agreement with - their contract with the federal government, there is very clear rules to protect against violating civil rights and to protect against any type of racial profiling. And one of them is that if you're going to go into a heavily, you know, minority community, you have to - or any community, period, any type of large-scale operation, you have to have empirical evidence, data, calls for service, some evidence that there's a crime problem there. And that has just blatantly been ignored by the sheriff's office, and they fully acknowledge that they've ignored that.

RYAN GABRIELSON : -- partnership, its 287(g) agreement, and the backlash - whether there will be backlash over that and whether she has to worry about that anymore now that she's in D.C. instead of Arizona. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is -- AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Salvador Reza -- go ahead. SALVADOR REZA : And I think the New York Times is right on target, you know, because if you're here - and we've been filming a lot of those sweeps, in which, you know, we've seen little kids, four, six years old, being separated from their moms, where there's no need to separate them, you know. The mom just did like, you know, a minor traffic ticket, and because of that, you know, they're separated. The kids are US citizens. And on top of that, the way that those little kids were treated, they were basically terrorized by masked sheriffs, which told me that I couldn't film, even though there's no law against filming. And the thing - it has become almost like a third world country here in Arizona. Maybe Sheriff Arpaio picked a lot of that while he was over there in Mexico under the DA. But the thing is, he is actually creating Maricopa County like if it was almost like Honduras or some other country where civil rights and human rights are basically being destroyed. And actually, the separation of the community is very stark and very marked, and to the point that his only friends are now his - his only friend left - and even his friend criticized him - was a prosecutor, Andrew Thomas, now his best friends, which are the board of supervisors, he has him under investigation, too. This is getting out of hand. AMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us, joining us from Phoenix, where President Obama and the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will be today to sign legislation around bank foreclosures of homes. Salvador Reza, member of the Puente movement in Phoenix, and Ryan Gabrielson, the George Polk Award-winning reporter with the East Valley Tribune , did a series on Sheriff Arpaio. This is Democracy Now! And on this issue of home foreclosures, when we come back from break, we go to Minneapolis, where one poor people's organization is saying \"No more.\" They're going into houses that are not occupied, and they're occupying them. Stay with us.\n\nSo with that as a pretext, he comes in to - so-called, to defend the business community. And by going in there, he doesn't go in just, you know, with officer; he brings his whole SWAT team, like he said before, his headquarters, mobile operations. Sometimes he brings helicopters. Sometimes he brings horses. And it's basically an intimidation type of tactics and all under the pretext of protecting business. When we talk to the business community, they say, \"We don't even want him around here,\" because they lose 60 to 70 percent of their sales whenever Sheriff Joe is in the area. So it's very negative to the community. And like you say, Napolitano is very aware of this. And at the same time, we believe that if they really do want to protect homeland security, they have to concentrate on the dangerous people, not on the gardeners and all of that. The other part can be done through immigration reform, which we hope that they actually do that. AMY GOODMAN : The New York Times recently had an editorial talking about Napolitano reviewing the enforcement efforts, including looking at ways to expand 287(g). \"Sheriff Arpaio,\" the New York Times says, \"is a powerful argument for doing just the opposite. Now that she has left Arizona politics behind, Ms. Napolitano is free to prove this is not Arpaio's America, where the mob rules and immigrants are subject to ritual humiliation. The country should expect no less.\" Ryan Gabrielson, do you think Napolitano will be able to rise to the task and challenge and change her own relationship with Arpaio? RYAN GABRIELSON : Well, to a great extent, the relationship had already changed before she left. Last year, there was, it was mentioned, the unserved warrants. A lot of Arpaio's operations, immigration operations, or at least a share of them, were funded through state grants. I think it was last March or so, or last May, she actually took $600,000 that had been set aside for him to do more of that enforcement and redirected it to create a new task force on - to serve these warrants. That was seen as not really something about the warrants, that it was about a rebuff to the sheriff and sort of a breaking of whatever ties were there. He's, since then, been blasting her constantly. I don't think there's a lot of love lost between the two anymore.

      "text": "Arizona county sheriffs say they will not enforce immigration measure if passed\n\nOn the ballot in November is a measure that will make it a state crime for migrants to cross into the US unofficially\n\nSheriffs in four Arizona counties that sit along the border with Mexico have warned that if voters in November pass a measure to make it a state crime for migrants to cross into the US unofficially, they will face problems enforcing the new law.\n\nCriticisms range from the law being unenforceable because of budget to it being \"racist\", with negative comments coming from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nNot long after the Arizona supreme court ruled that the controversial law known as Proposition 314 would be allowed on to the ballot, local sheriffs came into the spotlight, as well as other law enforcement bodies in the state.\n\nTo implement the controversial measure that would empower law enforcement to arrest and prosecute suspected violators, the state would essentially depend on the resources of counties on the Arizona-Mexico border, which stretches more than 370 miles.\n\nThe federal government has jurisdiction over enforcing US immigration laws, not individual states.\n\nSanta Cruz county, on the border immediately south of Tucson, is the smallest in the state yet is the location for its largest port of entry. David Hathaway, the Santa Cruz sheriff, told the Guardian he doesn't support Proposition 314 because \"it's a racist enforcement mechanism\".\n\nNearly 40,000 people who identified as Hispanic or Latino live under Hathaway's watch, out of a county population of almost 49,000. More than 78% of county residents speak Spanish at home, according to the US census .\n\n\"It would be ridiculous for me to go up to practically every single person in my county and say, 'Let me see your papers, I need to check your immigration status',\" said Hathaway, a Democrat, who worked as head of the Drug Enforcement Administration office in Nogales before being elected as the sheriff. Meanwhile, in Pima county, where more than 370,000 people who identified as Hispanic or Latino reside, Chris Nanos, the sheriff, said Proposition 314 \"would lead down a path of racial profiling\". But that's not the only reason why he would not enforce it if voters approve it, Nanos said. The measure would increase costs associated with arrest, prosecution and incarceration for local enforcement agencies, he added.\n\n\"If I book a migrant in my county jail, I'm paying for those costs without any funding from the state,\" said Nanos, who is running again as the Democratic candidate for Pima county sheriff in November. \"Who wants to do this silly law with no funding from the federal government? But here's another caveat that I've seen for a couple of decades: the federal government on the border doesn't have enough courts, therefore they don't have enough judges, they don't have enough attorneys.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I'm not going to allow my deputies to be on that border, to arrest people, to book them in our jail when we have a federal government that has that responsibility. They should have solved it years ago. And now they have an opportunity to do real legislation in Washington DC that says, 'hey, we need to redo our immigration policies' ... the problem today is that Washington will never resolve it.\"\n\nThe County Supervisors Association of Arizona is responsible for implementing state law at the local level, including the costs of law enforcement and criminal processing. \"The legislature did not provide additional funding for Proposition 314,\" said Craig Sullivan, executive director of the association. \"So if it passes, any implementation costs would be borne by local tax dollars.\"\n\nProposition 314 could result in additional costs for judicial proceedings, including an increase in demand for interpreter services.\n\nThe measure is similar to a Texas law known as SB4 that would allow local police and judges throughout the Lone Star state to arrest and deport anyone they suspect of entering the country illegally. Immigrants' rights groups and the Biden administration sued Texas to stop the law, which has been put on hold by a federal appeal court.\n\nIn June, advocates in Arizona filed a lawsuit challenging the passage of Proposition 314, alleging that it violates the civil and human rights of immigrants across the state.\n\nArizona law enforcement has a long history of discriminatory policing, advocates involved in the lawsuit said .\n\nJoe Arpaio, elected sheriff of Maricopa county in 1992, was once known as \"America's toughest sheriff\" because of his immigration enforcement tactics. Arpaio helped to turn tens of thousands of immigrants over to federal authorities for deportation. In 2017 he was convicted of criminal contempt of court for defying a federal judicial order to stop his infamous immigration patrols, then pardoned by then president Donald Trump.\n\nProposition 314 requires the Arizona department of corrections to accept those arrested or convicted of illegal entry if local enforcement agencies lack capacity. The department estimates that the prison system could see an annual influx of more than 1,500 people into their custody as a result of Proposition 314.\n\n\"It will see notable strains to day-to-day prison operations across an already taxed system,\" said the department of corrections in a preliminary review on the potential fiscal impacts of Proposition 314.\n\nProposition 314 also makes it a state crime to submit false documents to an employer to evade detection of employment eligibility under the government's e-verify program and it establishes a felony charge for the sale of fentanyl if the fentanyl causes the death of another person.\n\nTaking into account the estimated increase in work for the local authorities associated with Proposition 314, the Arizona prison system would reach full capacity in approximately June 2027, with a projected population reaching 43,000 inmates, the preliminary review said, adding the Arizona prison system doesn't have the staffing resources to support the growth. By 2029, the preliminary extra costs expected to accrue to the Arizona prison system will total nearly $252m.\n\nBen Toma, the Arizona house speaker and original sponsor of the bill did not respond to requests for an interview, nor requests for comment on how he and other lawmakers in support of the new law anticipate funding local entities.\n\nKatie Hobbs, the state governor, vetoed a previous, similar bill, but the ballot initiative in November would bypass her veto powers. The governor's office didn't respond to requests for comments on whether Hobbs would support more funding for border counties if voters pass the measure.\n\nCrossing into the US outside of an official port of entry is already a federal crime , but Arizona lawmakers have sought to also make it a state offense, giving them greater power to crack down on migration.\n\nMost of the migrants that enter the country outside of an official port of entry are most at risk of being quickly deported if apprehended by US border officials. In Arizona, migrants often travel through the remote areas in an attempt to evade arrest. Thousands of them have died in the desert.\n\nAccording to US Customs and Border Protection, federal immigration officers have arrested 490,942 individuals without lawful documentation on the Arizona-Mexico border in the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nThe Biden administration in June issued a new directive to curb high levels of migration into the US, which led to a dramatic decrease in unofficial border crossings in the following months.\n\nThe Cochise county sheriff, Mark Dannels, said: \"I understand the spirit and the intent behind Proposition 314. And I think it will pass because the majority of the citizens in this state want a change.\"\n\nHowever, Dannels, a Republican, added: \"Will I enforce the law? That's like saying I'm not going to enforce DUI [driving under the influence] laws because I just don't believe in that. No, you have to enforce the will of the people. I and other sheriffs are just trying to prepare ourselves before it passes because we don't have infrastructure. We don't have the funding, we don't have the personnel.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Yuma county, on the western end of the Arizona-Mexico border, the sheriff, Leon Wilmot, declined to speak with the Guardian. But at an earlier stage of the law's passage through the legislature, Wilmot, a Republican, told a local ABC News affiliate that: \"It will break the budget. And our county doesn't have the revenue to be able to handle that.\""

      "text": "Rightwing sheriffs' groups ramp up drives to monitor US midterm elections\n\nTwo Arizona-led groups boast more than 350 sheriffs as members nationwide and echo Trump's false claims about voting fraud\n\nTwo groups of rightwing sheriffs that echo some of Donald Trump's false claims about widespread voting fraud in 2020 are ramping up drives to monitor this year's elections for potential voting and election fraud.\n\nThe two Arizona-led groups together boast over 350 sheriffs as members nationwide, and have forged various ties with Texas-based True the Vote, which has a history of making unverified claims of voting fraud, spurring watchdogs and law enforcement veterans to voice alarms of looming threats to voting rights and election workers.\n\nThe burgeoning sheriffs' drive to investigate so-called voting fraud was evident at a secretive Arizona meeting on 13 August that drew a crowd of some 200 allies, including former sheriff Richard Mack and current sheriff Mark Lamb, who each lead sheriffs' groups. The True the Vote chief, Catherine Engelbrecht, arranged the event, Mack told the Guardian.\n\nThe gathering lasted about seven and a half hours and featured talks by Engelbrecht and Lamb, the sheriff of Pinal county, Arizona, who teamed up in June to create ProtectAmerica.Vote. to promote a larger role for sheriffs in election monitoring, said Mack.\n\n\"I totally support what they're doing,\" said Mack, who leads the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, which has thousands of members around the country, including hundreds of sheriffs.\n\nThe event, to which Mack invited several of his staff and two former law enforcement officials, provided \"more evidence of quite extensive election fraud\", said Mack. \"There's no way anyone in this country should be trusting computers to tabulate votes.\" The meeting, which was covered live by the conservative Right Side Broadcasting Network, was held at a venue \" that was very surreptitious\", added Mack, former sheriff of Graham county, Arizona.\n\nNotably, the gathering also heard at the outset from Kari Lake, the Trump-backed GOP gubernatorial nominee for Arizona and former Fox News reporter, and was attended by Mark Finchem, a state legislator and the Trump-endorsed nominee for secretary of state, which has authority over election supervision, according to Mack. Both Lake and Finchem are prominent election deniers.\n\nThe meeting, about a half-hour outside Scottsdale, underscores how sheriffs with Lamb's group, Protect America Now, and Mack's group, are working with True the Vote to provide more muscle to investigate charges of current and past voting fraud, despite numerous reports indicating such fraud is historically small, and was not significant in 2020 elections.\n\nAt a press conference in Las Vegas on 12 July with several sheriffs and Engelbrecht, Mack declared that investigating voting fraud is now his group's top priority, calling it a \"holy cause\".\n\nVoting watchdogs raise strong concerns about the budding alliances between far-right sheriffs and True the Vote.\n\n\"There is a critical role for law enforcement to play in protecting our elections: they should be offering protection to election officials and election workers that have come under attack as a result of lies being spread by groups like True the Vote,\" said Sean Morales-Doyle, the acting director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center. \"When law enforcement or anyone else spreads false claims about elections, they're contributing to pressure on election officials.\"\n\nMorales-Doyle added: \"True the Vote was one of the groups behind the failed lawsuits seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election. It has a long history of anti-voter conduct, including orchestrating mass challenges to voters, as it did in the 2021 Georgia runoff elections.\"\n\nBoth Engelbrecht and Mack have sparked other criticism for promoting 2020 election conspiracies, and Mack's sheriff's outfit and other sheriffs have pushed the dubious concept that they have extraordinary powers in their counties and can intervene in the running of elections and access voting equipment.\n\nMack's Constitutional Sheriffs website, which he launched in 2011 and has hundreds of members, claims that a sheriff's authority in a county is greater than those of other officials and \"even supersedes the powers of the president\".\n\nMack and his group have prompted other concerns due to ties to anti-government groups: Mack spent a few years on the board of Oath Keepers, the militia group that played a key role in the January 6 attack on the Capitol that led to several of its members being charged with seditious conspiracy, before he left the board in 2016.\n\n\"I think it's a significant overreach of authority by sheriffs across the country, including Mack and Lamb, to on their own declare they have the authority to investigate voting fraud,\" said David Mahoney, a former president of the country's largest sheriffs organization, the National Sheriffs Association which represents some 3000 sheriffs.\n\n\"Mack has promoted a whole host of conspiracies,\" said Mahoney, who spent 15 years as sheriff of Dane county, Wisconsin. \"I think it's entirely for self-aggrandizement and to make himself relevant. Mack is playing to a far-right constituency and helps feed conspiracies.\"\n\nMahoney added that Mack \"has said individuals have the right to form militias. I put very little credibility in him.\"\n\nBut Mack and True the Vote now seem to be on the same page in a growing crusade to hunt for election fraud.\n\nLast month in Las Vegas during the annual libertarian Freedom Fest, Mack's group hosted a panel talk that featured several like-minded sheriffs and Engelbrecht, who revealed her rationale for enlisting sheriffs in her long-running search for alleged voting fraud.\n\n\"All of a sudden, it's like the lights went on. It's the sheriffs,\" she told an audience of about 200 attendees at the event. \"That's who can do these investigations. That's who we can trust.\"\n\nTo cement other ties and bolster the hunt for voting fraud, True the Vote and a sheriffs group led by Lamb, Protect America Now which claims about 70 members in 30 states, in June formed ProtectAmerica.Vote.\n\nThe joint effort features an \"election integrity hotline\" that True the Vote has deployed in past elections that can connect citizens with tips to sheriffs and ads that the group hopes to run in a \"handful of states\", Engelbrecht told the Guardian.\n\nProtectAmerica.Vote also may give grants to some sheriffs in key states such as Wisconsin and Michigan where county sheriffs have launched investigations into alleged election fraud, and provide surveillance equipment to monitor drop boxes and other voting sites, she added. To date Engelbrecht said they had raised slightly more than $100,000 of a $1m-plus goal.\n\n\"There's no question there was tremendous election fraud in 2020,\" Engelbrecht said despite numerous reports stating otherwise. \"We have big, big problems. We found many ways in which the election process was subverted in 2020.\"\n\nEngelbrecht added her new drive with sheriffs aims to \"identify preventive solutions to avoid a repeat of 2020\".\n\nThe website for ProtectAmerica.Vote states its mission is to \"empower sheriffs\" and \"connect citizens and sheriffs\" as part of a wide-ranging drive to ferret out potential voting fraud. In a video on its website Sheriff Lamb of Pinal county says: \"We will engage voters, we'll help clear up confusion through education and where necessary sheriffs can and will investigate where laws are being broken.\"\n\nSince Engelbrecht, an early Tea Party activist, founded the dark money True the Vote in 2009 it has raised millions of dollars boasting to have discovered widespread voting fraud, but not revealed significant evidence to back up such allegations, say several voting analysts and watchdogs.\n\nTrue the Vote's financial angels have in recent years included several of the right's top donors. The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, State Policy Network, Franklin Center for Government & Public Integrity, DonorsTrust, the League of American Voters and Judicial Crisis Network have reported giving money to True the Vote since its founding, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks campaign financing.\n\nTrue the Vote has seen its star rise in Trump world and \"big lie\" circles this year due to its key role in 2000 Mules, a film by rightwing provocateur and commentator Dinesh D'Souza that purported to show major fraud linked to ballot drop boxes in 2020, but was widely panned for its weak evidence.\n\nTrue the Vote supplied surveillance video and cellphone tracking data that were instrumental in making the film. But critics have faulted it for its flawed methodology and unproven claims that Democrats rigged the vote in several major states Biden won by paying \"mules\" who delivered 400,000 illegal votes.\n\nFormer attorney general William Barr called the film \"singularly unimpressive\" during an interview he had with the House panel investigating January 6. Other critics go further.\n\n\"2000 Mules failed spectacularly in its efforts to present demonstrable evidence of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election,\" said David Levine, a former Idaho election official and the elections integrity fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy.\n\n\"Experts in geo-tracking data analysis say GPS data from apps on cellphones aren't even precise enough to place cellphone users at a drop box, let alone show the commission of a crime at one.\"\n\nMack was impressed by the documentary, which debuted at Mar-a-Lago, saying the evidence it presented \"is overwhelming and justifies criminal investigation\". But Mack added that \"if True the Vote and D'Souza lied they should be charged\".\n\nStill, the heavy criticism of 2000 Mules spurred True the Vote to make several promises that more explosive evidence would be coming soon.\n\nAt the Arizona meeting on 13 August, Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, a key associate who had starred in 2000 Mules, finally unveiled their promised bombshell, dubbed \"The Pit\".\n\nWhat Phillips had hailed as \"devastating\" materials that were left out of 2000 Mules turned out to be only a new website Open.ink where they promised to put election lawsuit documents from various states and surveillance videos of drop boxes.\n\nOn another controversial front, True the Vote's financial operations have drawn more scrutiny since June when Reveal news published a well-documented report focused on questionable accounting and insider financial dealings that seem to have personally benefited Engelbrecht and key associates.\n\nEngelbrecht attacked the story, saying \"it was filled with inaccuracies\".\n\nMarc Owens, a former chief of the tax exempt division at the Internal Revenue Service, told the Guardian that Reveal's report underscored \"a pattern of insider financial transactions totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars involving Engelbrecht and the organization's senior management and advisers\".\n\nMore broadly, True the Vote's growing alliance with sheriffs to mount aggressive election fraud monitoring drives has prompted some former federal prosecutors to raise strong concerns.\n\n\"I am aware of no state that permits vigilante-style election monitoring and voter fraud hunting by zealous conspiracy minded conservatives and sheriffs,\" Paul Pelletier, the former acting chief of the fraud section at the Department of Justice, said.\n\n\"Given True the Vote's history of wholly unsupportable claims of fraud, the group's 'election monitoring' alliance with some sheriffs who claim extraordinary powers for themselves runs the risk of violating federal law by intimidating voters. It seems to me they are flying too close to the sun here, and I am sure the DoJ [Department of Justice] will pay special attention to anyone who acts to intimidate or interfere with voters who are exercising their rights so fundamental to a democracy.\""

The group is known for attacks on Covid mask mandates and gun control measures.\n\nThe Vegas confab is slated to feature talks by Mack and several conspiracy-minded Trump allies who have been major election denialists including the retired lieutenant general Mike Flynn, the MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell and the multimillionaire Patrick Byrne.\n\nThe event's agenda and crew of Trump allies participating in it underscores how Trump's campaign to return to the White House harbors extremist ties and beliefs, running from conspiracy theories around election fraud and the January 6 insurrection to Christian nationalism.\n\nMack, an ex-board member of the extremist Oath Keepers, told the Guardian that a key focus of the training session for sheriffs and others will be on the \"chaos at the border\" and the threat of voting fraud by non-citizens.\n\n\"Election fraud and the border go hand in hand,\" said Mack. Dozens of candidates and elected officials including sheriffs from states such as Arizona and Nevada are expected to attend the gathering, Mack added.\n\nThe Brennan Center for Justice and other experts have revealed that the amount of voting by non-citizens is minuscule.\n\nOne Brennan Center study that focused on the 2016 election showed that only 0.0001% of votes across 42 jurisdictions, with a total of 23.5 million votes, were suspected to involve non-citizens voting, or 30 incidents in total.\n\nLikewise, the former federal judge John Jones said the suggestion that non-citizens are fueling voting fraud \"seems to be an outrageous reach\". In his 19 years as a judge, Jones said, \"I sentenced hundreds of people for illegal entry to the US and not one for illegal voting.\"\n\nBesides raising the specter of illegal immigrant voting, Mack made the sweeping claim that \"sheriffs have the right and the responsibility to take action when they see other government corruption,\" adding that the \"proof of corruption with our elections is irrefutable\".\n\nMack indicated these themes are likely to be part of the keynote address he will deliver at the Vegas meeting.\n\nSimilarly, Mack's group has taught that elected sheriffs ought to \"protect their citizens from the overreach of an out-of-control federal government\" and to refuse to enforce laws they regard as unconstitutional or \"unjust\".\n\nSome ex-sheriffs and experts voice strong concerns about the roles that Mack and his group, which boasts hundreds of members nationwide, are playing with their claims of extraordinary powers and conspiratorial rhetoric about election fraud by non-citizens.\n\n\"When you say 'constitutional sheriff', you're giving yourself a moniker and status that ascends that of your ethical peer group,\" said Paul Penzone, a former Maricopa county Arizona sheriff who now chairs the Committee for Safe and Secure Elections. \"Our job is to manage public safety and investigate crimes. It's not to influence or impede the outcome of elections.\"\n\nJones said Mack's specter of voting fraud by non-citizens represents \"an extension of the insurrectionist behavior we've seen, and just like the stolen election rhetoric it's bereft of any facts, as is the contention that illegals are voting\".\n\n\"I fear this is an attempt to gin up certain segments of the electorate in anticipation of the presidential election in November,\" Jones added.\n\nThe focus by Mack's group on voting fraud by non-citizens comes as Trump and the House speaker, Mike Johnson, held a joint press conference last Friday at Mar-a-Lago to promote a new bill that Johnson plans to introduce to ban non-citizens from voting, even though it is already illegal.\n\nFurther, the rightwing lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who runs an election integrity network at the Conservative Partnership Institute, where she is a senior legal fellow, has been fueling conspiracies about non-citizen voting.\n\nAccording to NPR, Mitchell has circulated a two-page memo on \"the threat of non-citizen voting in 2024\".\n\nMitchell also told an Illinois talk radio show this year: \"I absolutely believe this is intentional, and one of the reasons the Biden administration is allowing all these illegals to flood the country.\"\n\nMitchell was on Trump's call with the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, on 2 January 2021 when Trump pressed him hard to \"find\" 11,780 votes to overturn his defeat there.\n\nOther Trump allies who have promoted baseless fraud claims about Trump's 2020 loss and are scheduled to speak at the Vegas event seem to have embraced conspiratorial links between illegal immigrants and voting fraud.\n\nAmong them is Byrne, who Mack said has been a \"regular\" funder of his efforts for some time, and who in 2021 founded the America Project, which has been in the vanguard of promoting bogus charges of voting fraud in 2020.\n\nMack said Byrne's talk in Las Vegas would focus on the \"deep state\", the conspiratorial term that suggests Trump, Maga allies and others are targets of a vast plot by Democratic-allied law enforcement officers, intelligence agencies and other bureaucratic forces.\n\nSimilarly, Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, is said to have been fanning concerns about illegal voting by non-citizens while on a national tour promoting a new movie about his life, according to a person close to the Trump campaign. \"I've heard that illegal immigrant voting has been discussed at recent Flynn events,\" he said.\n\nFlynn has for months been talking up the need for a broad \"guard the vote\" drive, which Trump has touted too.\n\nOn another election front that is expected to be part of the Vegas gathering, Mack echoed Lindell's bogeyman of getting rid of electronic voting machines and replacing them with all-paper ballots that are hand-counted. Mack claimed without evidence that machines \"guarantee the likelihood of cheating because they're hackable. No one can guarantee the machines aren't being hacked.\"\n\nThe Vegas meeting is also slated to hear from the Arizona state senate candidate Mark Finchem, who lost his 2022 race to be secretary of state, which he charged was due to fraud, prompting a court to sanction him for making false claims.\n\nSome ex-Republican House members have voiced strong worries about Mack's mission and the Trump allies working in tandem with him to rev up fears of illegal non-citizen voting and other exaggerated claims of voting fraud\n\n\"This is a continuing effort to divide our country by Trump and his minions and to motivate and excite his base,\" the ex-House Republican member Dave Trott told the Guardian. \"They're clearly trying to come up with additional arguments to challenge election results if Trump loses.\"\n\nVeteran prosecutors and election watchdogs share these fears.\n\n\"Mack and his group pose a clear and present danger in the upcoming 2024 election cycle,\" said Paul Pelletier, a former acting chief of the fraud section at the justice department. \"Mixing this false specter of voting fraud by non-citizens with private rightwing 'vote enforcers' will energize a toxic environment that puts all voters of color in danger, especially those in border states.\"\n\nAmerican Oversight's interim executive director, Chioma Chukwu, told the Guardian: \"Nothing is more dangerous to our democracy than a movement based on election lies promoted by radical law enforcement officials who falsely believe they are the ultimate authority, including on matters of election administration.\""

It's not to influence or impede the outcome of elections.\"\n\nJones said Mack's specter of voting fraud by non-citizens represents \"an extension of the insurrectionist behavior we've seen, and just like the stolen election rhetoric it's bereft of any facts, as is the contention that illegals are voting\".\n\n\"I fear this is an attempt to gin up certain segments of the electorate in anticipation of the presidential election in November,\" Jones added.\n\nThe focus by Mack's group on voting fraud by non-citizens comes as Trump and the House speaker, Mike Johnson, held a joint press conference last Friday at Mar-a-Lago to promote a new bill that Johnson plans to introduce to ban non-citizens from voting, even though it is already illegal.\n\nFurther, the rightwing lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who runs an election integrity network at the Conservative Partnership Institute, where she is a senior legal fellow, has been fueling conspiracies about non-citizen voting.\n\nAccording to NPR, Mitchell has circulated a two-page memo on \"the threat of non-citizen voting in 2024\".\n\nMitchell also told an Illinois talk radio show this year: \"I absolutely believe this is intentional, and one of the reasons the Biden administration is allowing all these illegals to flood the country.\"\n\nMitchell was on Trump's call with the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, on 2 January 2021 when Trump pressed him hard to \"find\" 11,780 votes to overturn his defeat there.\n\nOther Trump allies who have promoted baseless fraud claims about Trump's 2020 loss and are scheduled to speak at the Vegas event seem to have embraced conspiratorial links between illegal immigrants and voting fraud.\n\nAmong them is Byrne, who Mack said has been a \"regular\" funder of his efforts for some time, and who in 2021 founded the America Project, which has been in the vanguard of promoting bogus charges of voting fraud in 2020.\n\nMack said Byrne's talk in Las Vegas would focus on the \"deep state\", the conspiratorial term that suggests Trump, Maga allies and others are targets of a vast plot by Democratic-allied law enforcement officers, intelligence agencies and other bureaucratic forces.\n\nSimilarly, Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, is said to have been fanning concerns about illegal voting by non-citizens while on a national tour promoting a new movie about his life, according to a person close to the Trump campaign. \"I've heard that illegal immigrant voting has been discussed at recent Flynn events,\" he said.\n\nFlynn has for months been talking up the need for a broad \"guard the vote\" drive, which Trump has touted too.\n\nOn another election front that is expected to be part of the Vegas gathering, Mack echoed Lindell's bogeyman of getting rid of electronic voting machines and replacing them with all-paper ballots that are hand-counted. Mack claimed without evidence that machines \"guarantee the likelihood of cheating because they're hackable. No one can guarantee the machines aren't being hacked.\"\n\nThe Vegas meeting is also slated to hear from the Arizona state senate candidate Mark Finchem, who lost his 2022 race to be secretary of state, which he charged was due to fraud, prompting a court to sanction him for making false claims.\n\nSome ex-Republican House members have voiced strong worries about Mack's mission and the Trump allies working in tandem with him to rev up fears of illegal non-citizen voting and other exaggerated claims of voting fraud\n\n\"This is a continuing effort to divide our country by Trump and his minions and to motivate and excite his base,\" the ex-House Republican member Dave Trott told the Guardian. \"They're clearly trying to come up with additional arguments to challenge election results if Trump loses.\"\n\nVeteran prosecutors and election watchdogs share these fears.\n\n\"Mack and his group pose a clear and present danger in the upcoming 2024 election cycle,\" said Paul Pelletier, a former acting chief of the fraud section at the justice department. \"Mixing this false specter of voting fraud by non-citizens with private rightwing 'vote enforcers' will energize a toxic environment that puts all voters of color in danger, especially those in border states.\"\n\nAmerican Oversight's interim executive director, Chioma Chukwu, told the Guardian: \"Nothing is more dangerous to our democracy than a movement based on election lies promoted by radical law enforcement officials who falsely believe they are the ultimate authority, including on matters of election administration.\""

Here is a taste of local media scrutiny of 10 of them\n\nD onald Trump whipped up another rowdy ovation from a friendly crowd this week with an attack on the media, accusing journalists of being \"very, very dishonest\" and refusing to give him credit for his purported achievements.\n\nBut rather than the usual sports stadium packed with partisans in red baseball caps, this tirade against the press was applauded by dozens of senior law enforcement officials in the splendour of the East Room of the White House.\n\nThe episode unfolded on Wednesday afternoon, after the New York Times published an article by an unidentified senior Trump administration official who claimed to be one of many working to thwart Trump's \"worst inclinations\" and frustrate his agenda.\n\nSome figures in law enforcement were dismayed by the sheriffs' response to Trump's remarks.\n\n\"They are supposed to be leaders, not puppets who cheer attacks on the media,\" said Michael Bromwich , a former federal prosecutor. \"A shameful scene.\"\n\nA review of coverage produced by regional media outlets over recent years found that many of the sheriffs who cheered the president have come under sharp scrutiny from the press for their own actions - or for those of the officers in their departments.\n\nThey have been held accountable by local journalists for incidents including the leaving of a service pistol in a casino bathroom, alleged mistreatment in jails, the wearing of blackface by an officer, and various other actions.\n\nHere, the Guardian has compiled some of the notable reporting on the sheriffs who appeared with Trump:\n\nFranklin is under investigation by the FBI and state authorities after a local news blogger, Glenda Lockhart, disclosed last year that the sheriff used $150,000 in public money to invest in a now-bankrupt used car dealership that was part-owned by a convicted fraudster. The money was taken from a fund meant for feeding inmates in the county jail.\n\nThe sheriff's office recruited Lockhart's grandson as an informant as they attempted to find a source leaking information to the blogger. The grandson said he was paid to install spyware on Lockhart's computer. Franklin's deputies raided Lockhart's home and seized her computer. Franklin was found by a judge to have broken the law .\n\nLockhart's findings have been built upon by several local reporters, including WAAY-31 television 's investigations team and the Decatur Daily . In a statement posted to Facebook in April, Franklin incorrectly described the stories about her as \"misinformation, false reports and slander\".\n\nHodgson recently claimed he was the victim of a \"witch-hunt\", after the Massachusetts attorney general called for an investigation of suicides and mistreatment in his jails, in response to findings by the New England Center For Investigative Reporting .\n\nOther media, including the Boston Globe , have highlighted a series of controversies around Hodgson's actions in office, such as his attempts to charge inmates $5 a day for being locked in his jail and the placing of prisoners with mental health problems in solitary confinement.\n\nAn attorney for Hodgson's daughter, Michelle, complained that she received unfair media attention in 2014, when she was arrested and charged with witness intimidation. Then 29, Michelle Hodgson was accused of interfering as police tried to deal with a late-night mass shooting, asking \"Do you know that my father's the sheriff?\" and threatening to have an officer fired as she was detained. She pleaded not guilty and the charges were dropped .\n\nIn May this year it was reported by KTNV News that Wehrly left her Glock .45 service pistol in the bathroom of a casino. It was discovered by a cleaner. Wehrly, who could not immediately recall what day the incident had occurred, told a reporter it was not the first time she had mislaid her weapon. She later apologised for the mishap.\n\nThe local station also uncovered a series of false statements made by Wehrly's office about the fatal shooting of a family dog by one of Wehrly's deputies, leading to an internal investigation.\n\nWehrly also attracted coverage from the Las Vegas Review-Journal for publicly funded recruitment billboards that critics alleged were election campaign signs in disguise. Wehrly said the signs were within the rules and were approved by ethics regulators.\n\nJenkins's department was the subject of a deeply reported investigation last November by the investigations team at WRC-TV . Former deputies told reporters the office suffered from \"chaos, bullying and turnover problems\" and accused Jenkins of creating a hostile environment. Jenkins vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nThe Culpeper Star-Exponent followed up on WRC-TV's finding that Jenkins flew first class while travelling the country for work. Jenkins said the county was reimbursed by inmates paying fees and asked: \"Have you seen the size of coach seats?\"\n\nOther regional media, including the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star , closely followed a lawsuit brought against officials including Jenkins by a wrongfully convicted man who was freed after serving 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Jenkins was accused of suppressing evidence during the investigation, which he denied. The lawsuit was settled.\n\nRichardson was sharply criticised in January this year by the editorial board of the Ogden Standard-Examiner , which accused him of abdicating \"his financial responsibility to Davis county taxpayers\" and openly defying the rules on running his department.\n\nThe newspaper earlier reported that the sheriff was found by county auditors to have approved a deputy's bogus time cards, paid out questionable travel expenses for deputies and mishandled money that relatives sent for prisoners at his jail.\n\nIn May this year, Richardson apologised for a harassment scandal in his department, which was closely followed by reporters at KUTV.\n\nDeputies working for Ivey have repeatedly attracted bad press this year. In March, one was charged with drug and child neglect offences after officers investigating reports of screaming and gunfire at his home discovered cocaine and bullet casings. In May, three deputies were charged with driving drunk while off-duty.\n\nAs the Guardian reported during Trump's 2016 election campaign , Ivey retired as a state law enforcement officer in 2011, three days after he was accused by a local muckraking website of making a threatening telephone call to a female probation officer who was the ex-fiancee of Ivey's son, Robert.\n\nIvey denied wrongdoing. A review by the Florida department of law enforcement (FDLE) said no complaint had been made by the female officer, and that because Ivey was no longer employed by FDLE, the case was out of the department's hands.\n\nIn November last year, Diggs reassigned a deputy who posed in blackface while dressing up as Frederica Wilson, a Democratic congresswoman who was lambasted by Trump for revealing the president told a constituent that her husband, a US soldier killed in Niger, \"knew what he signed up for\".\n\nDiggs said he was disappointed that local members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) revealed the incident to the media rather than continuing to address it privately with his office. The controversy was covered by the Williamsburg and Yorktown Daily , and the Daily Press of Newport News.\n\nBailey's office was the subject of an investigation by ABC57 television into allegations deputies mistreated and sexually abused female jail inmates. The series led to a total of 19 women making accusations against seven guards or former guards.\n\nThree deputies resigned and one was charged with offering money for prostitution , to which he pleaded no contest. A lawsuit brought by 10 of the women was dismissed in February this year after a federal judge ruled that the statute of limitations on their allegations had passed.\n\nBailey told south-west Michigan's Herald Palladium following Wednesday's meeting at the White House that he shared Trump's displeasure at \"some media not telling the truth\".\n\nIn October last year, a hastily deleted Facebook post by Lewis was reported by WBOC television, generating controversy in south-eastern Maryland.\n\nIn the post, Lewis railed against African American protesters who demonstrated at a Baltimore Ravens game, accusing them of \"refusing to accept responsibility for your own failures and your own perceived inequities\". Lewis said protesters claiming to be the victims of injustice would succeed if only they would \"get off [their] butt and WORK for it\".\n\nReams's department became the subject of a criminal inquiry in 2015, after a local news reporter's investigation led to a former deputy being charged with the murder of his wife, whose death three years earlier had been ruled a suicide.\n\nFormer deputy Tom Fallis was arrested after reporting by KDVR found evidence linking him to his wife's fatal shooting was misstated or omitted during the original police investigation. Fallis was eventually acquitted after a trial.\n\nSeveral of Fallis's colleagues arrived at the scene after the shooting. KDVR reported that Reams, then the office's chief of public safety, \"ordered his top commander Paul Wood to the Fallis scene and that Wood gave the orders, and the deputies followed them\". Reams denied any wrongdoing in connection with the incident.\n\nTwo of Reams's deputies were later fired amid allegations officers did not give a full account of what happened. An attorney for one questioned how it could have taken so long for Reams to discover information had been withheld. \"Imagine a sheriff who doesn't know this for three years,\" said the attorney, Rick Blundell."

The money was taken from a fund meant for feeding inmates in the county jail.\n\nThe sheriff's office recruited Lockhart's grandson as an informant as they attempted to find a source leaking information to the blogger. The grandson said he was paid to install spyware on Lockhart's computer. Franklin's deputies raided Lockhart's home and seized her computer. Franklin was found by a judge to have broken the law .\n\nLockhart's findings have been built upon by several local reporters, including WAAY-31 television 's investigations team and the Decatur Daily . In a statement posted to Facebook in April, Franklin incorrectly described the stories about her as \"misinformation, false reports and slander\".\n\nHodgson recently claimed he was the victim of a \"witch-hunt\", after the Massachusetts attorney general called for an investigation of suicides and mistreatment in his jails, in response to findings by the New England Center For Investigative Reporting .\n\nOther media, including the Boston Globe , have highlighted a series of controversies around Hodgson's actions in office, such as his attempts to charge inmates $5 a day for being locked in his jail and the placing of prisoners with mental health problems in solitary confinement.\n\nAn attorney for Hodgson's daughter, Michelle, complained that she received unfair media attention in 2014, when she was arrested and charged with witness intimidation. Then 29, Michelle Hodgson was accused of interfering as police tried to deal with a late-night mass shooting, asking \"Do you know that my father's the sheriff?\" and threatening to have an officer fired as she was detained. She pleaded not guilty and the charges were dropped .\n\nIn May this year it was reported by KTNV News that Wehrly left her Glock .45 service pistol in the bathroom of a casino. It was discovered by a cleaner. Wehrly, who could not immediately recall what day the incident had occurred, told a reporter it was not the first time she had mislaid her weapon. She later apologised for the mishap.\n\nThe local station also uncovered a series of false statements made by Wehrly's office about the fatal shooting of a family dog by one of Wehrly's deputies, leading to an internal investigation.\n\nWehrly also attracted coverage from the Las Vegas Review-Journal for publicly funded recruitment billboards that critics alleged were election campaign signs in disguise. Wehrly said the signs were within the rules and were approved by ethics regulators.\n\nJenkins's department was the subject of a deeply reported investigation last November by the investigations team at WRC-TV . Former deputies told reporters the office suffered from \"chaos, bullying and turnover problems\" and accused Jenkins of creating a hostile environment. Jenkins vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nThe Culpeper Star-Exponent followed up on WRC-TV's finding that Jenkins flew first class while travelling the country for work. Jenkins said the county was reimbursed by inmates paying fees and asked: \"Have you seen the size of coach seats?\"\n\nOther regional media, including the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star , closely followed a lawsuit brought against officials including Jenkins by a wrongfully convicted man who was freed after serving 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Jenkins was accused of suppressing evidence during the investigation, which he denied. The lawsuit was settled.\n\nRichardson was sharply criticised in January this year by the editorial board of the Ogden Standard-Examiner , which accused him of abdicating \"his financial responsibility to Davis county taxpayers\" and openly defying the rules on running his department.\n\nThe newspaper earlier reported that the sheriff was found by county auditors to have approved a deputy's bogus time cards, paid out questionable travel expenses for deputies and mishandled money that relatives sent for prisoners at his jail.\n\nIn May this year, Richardson apologised for a harassment scandal in his department, which was closely followed by reporters at KUTV.\n\nDeputies working for Ivey have repeatedly attracted bad press this year. In March, one was charged with drug and child neglect offences after officers investigating reports of screaming and gunfire at his home discovered cocaine and bullet casings. In May, three deputies were charged with driving drunk while off-duty.\n\nAs the Guardian reported during Trump's 2016 election campaign , Ivey retired as a state law enforcement officer in 2011, three days after he was accused by a local muckraking website of making a threatening telephone call to a female probation officer who was the ex-fiancee of Ivey's son, Robert.\n\nIvey denied wrongdoing. A review by the Florida department of law enforcement (FDLE) said no complaint had been made by the female officer, and that because Ivey was no longer employed by FDLE, the case was out of the department's hands.\n\nIn November last year, Diggs reassigned a deputy who posed in blackface while dressing up as Frederica Wilson, a Democratic congresswoman who was lambasted by Trump for revealing the president told a constituent that her husband, a US soldier killed in Niger, \"knew what he signed up for\".\n\nDiggs said he was disappointed that local members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) revealed the incident to the media rather than continuing to address it privately with his office. The controversy was covered by the Williamsburg and Yorktown Daily , and the Daily Press of Newport News.\n\nBailey's office was the subject of an investigation by ABC57 television into allegations deputies mistreated and sexually abused female jail inmates. The series led to a total of 19 women making accusations against seven guards or former guards.\n\nThree deputies resigned and one was charged with offering money for prostitution , to which he pleaded no contest. A lawsuit brought by 10 of the women was dismissed in February this year after a federal judge ruled that the statute of limitations on their allegations had passed.\n\nBailey told south-west Michigan's Herald Palladium following Wednesday's meeting at the White House that he shared Trump's displeasure at \"some media not telling the truth\".\n\nIn October last year, a hastily deleted Facebook post by Lewis was reported by WBOC television, generating controversy in south-eastern Maryland.\n\nIn the post, Lewis railed against African American protesters who demonstrated at a Baltimore Ravens game, accusing them of \"refusing to accept responsibility for your own failures and your own perceived inequities\". Lewis said protesters claiming to be the victims of injustice would succeed if only they would \"get off [their] butt and WORK for it\".\n\nReams's department became the subject of a criminal inquiry in 2015, after a local news reporter's investigation led to a former deputy being charged with the murder of his wife, whose death three years earlier had been ruled a suicide.\n\nFormer deputy Tom Fallis was arrested after reporting by KDVR found evidence linking him to his wife's fatal shooting was misstated or omitted during the original police investigation. Fallis was eventually acquitted after a trial.\n\nSeveral of Fallis's colleagues arrived at the scene after the shooting. KDVR reported that Reams, then the office's chief of public safety, \"ordered his top commander Paul Wood to the Fallis scene and that Wood gave the orders, and the deputies followed them\". Reams denied any wrongdoing in connection with the incident.\n\nTwo of Reams's deputies were later fired amid allegations officers did not give a full account of what happened. An attorney for one questioned how it could have taken so long for Reams to discover information had been withheld. \"Imagine a sheriff who doesn't know this for three years,\" said the attorney, Rick Blundell."

      "text": "Police Officers, Sheriffs, Rangers, and Marshals: What's the Difference?\n\nThe best answer to any question\n\nWhat is the difference between police, sheriff, ranger (like Texas Rangers), and marshal? : originally appeared on Quora : The best answer to any question. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter , Facebook , and Google+ .\n\nAnswer by Tim Dees , Retired cop and criminal justice professor\n\nPolice are usually general-purpose law enforcement officers. They are most often employed by a city government, but may be employed by a county, state, college, hospital, transit district, or other quasi-governmental organization with the power to create a law enforcement branch.\n\nThe \"usually\" part has to do mainly with federal police forces. If you pay close attention when you're in Washington, D.C. and its environs, you'll notice that almost every federal government agency has its own police. There's the Bureau of Printing and Engraving Police, the FBI Police, the Smithsonian Institution Police, the U.S. Capitol Police, the U.S. Supreme Court Police, and so on. They are armed, they have police-type uniforms, they often have marked patrol cars with emergency lights and sirens, and they can make arrests and serve warrants. However, their function is more like a security force, protecting the people and facilities under the umbrella of their employer. Serious crimes committed on or in their facilities will usually be handled by an inspector general's office (that also has police powers, and special agents, like the FBI does) or the FBI. The cars are mostly driven around the perimeter streets and possibly between satellite facilities.\n\nThe sheriff is an elected official, the chief executive of a sheriff's department. Most sheriffs operate under the county government, with a few city sheriffs (mostly in Virginia, where cities are legally not a part of the county that surrounds them). Forty nine states have sheriffs. The only exception is Alaska, which has no counties.\n\nThe word \"sheriff\" is a portmanteau of \"shire reeve,\" which was the tax collector in medieval England. In some states, the sheriff is also the tax collector.\n\nIn most states, the sheriff is a constitutional officer, meaning that counties must have a sheriff. The office may be largely ceremonial, with some duties to serve papers and provide security for the courts. In other states, the sheriff does these things and also runs the county jail. In most states, the sheriff does all of these, and also provides general law enforcement services to unincorporated areas of the county and some cities that do not have their own police, and contract to the sheriff to provide police services.\n\nA few counties have both a sheriff's department (also called a sheriff's office -- the names are more or less interchangeable) and a county police department. This usually comes about when the county government doesn't want to have a chief law enforcement officer they can't fire at will. The county police department has a chief of police, who reports to the county commission and serves at their pleasure. Where this happens, the county sheriff is relegated to running the jail and serving legal process.\n\nLine employees of a sheriff's department are called deputies or deputy sheriffs. They generally have the same law enforcement powers as a police officer.\n\nRangers, at least as general-service law enforcement officers at the state level, are limited to Texas. The Texas Rangers have a history going back many years and are the top of the police pecking order in Texas. Many states will have park or forest rangers who work for their proprietary government subdivisions (division of state parks, department of forestry, etc.), and may or may not have police powers (they usually do). Where they do not have police powers, they generally function as naturalists or conservation officers.\n\nMost state-level law enforcement officers are members of state highway patrols or state police agencies, and have the title of \"trooper.\" California is an exception. California Highway Patrol officers have the title State Traffic Officer.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Marshals may provide security for the court and court staff, and may also serve subpoenas and arrest warrants. At the federal level, the U.S. Marshals (not marshalls) Service provides security for the courts, transports witnesses and prisoners to and from court, may transport inmates between federal corrections facilities, and runs the witness protection program.\n\nA city marshal might serve subpoenas, provide court security, and take custody of people arrested on warrants. In Reno and Las Vegas, for example, when a city police officer (the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department is an amalgam of the former Las Vegas Police and Clark County Sheriffs Office, formed in 1973, and headed by an elected sheriff) locates someone with an arrest warrant issued by the municipal court, they can call a deputy marshal to the scene. The deputy marshals wear police-type uniforms and drive marked patrol cars. They take custody of the arrestee and book them at the county jail. The police officer can then resume patrol.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Departing From 'Sanctuary Cities,' Some Sheriffs Embrace Immigration Enforcement Role\n\nStateline provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.\n\nSheriff Ed Gonzalez withdrew Harris County, Texas, from its 287(g) agreement with federal immigration officials, citing concerns about staffing costs. But with encouragement from the Trump administration, more sheriffs and local jails are electing to help deport unauthorized immigrants.\n\nBy Tim Henderson\n\nFREDERICK, Md. - In a whitewashed cinderblock room here at the Frederick County Detention Center, each new inmate answers two questions: \"What country were you born in?\" and \"Of what country are you a citizen?\"\n\nA sheriff's deputy will investigate any inmate who says he was born in another country, using computer equipment and databases provided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Those found to be in the country illegally could face extra jail time and deportation.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office in this western Maryland county is one of 41 law enforcement agencies, generally county jails run by sheriffs, who have agreed to help federal immigration authorities deport unauthorized immigrants in what are known as 287(g) partnerships. The participants stand in stark contrast to \"sanctuary cities\": Instead of declining to cooperate with federal immigration officials, these sheriffs have volunteered to investigate the immigration status of prisoners when they book them.\n\nDespite concerns about the added personnel costs and the possibility of being sued for civil rights violations , a variety of local officials, from conservative sheriffs in Texas to a liberal county executive in New Jersey, have embraced the program.\n\nMany sheriffs who are participating cite a desire to investigate prisoners as soon as possible, to root out those with serious criminal histories before they are released on bail. Some of the sheriffs, especially along the Southwest border, say they want to help federal authorities protect national security. Many of them agree with President Donald Trump that it's time for a crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\n\"I think the general populace is tired of illegal immigration - tired of the costs and tired of being victims of crimes,\" said Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins.\n\nIn New Jersey, Hudson County Executive Tom DeGise, who describes himself as a liberal Democrat, said he wants his New York City suburb, where 42 percent of residents are immigrants, to continue taking part in the program as long as it targets only violent criminals.\n\n\"Serious criminals, especially those who commit sexual assaults against women and children or engage in violent felonies don't deserve to remain in this country to prey on the very immigrants we cherish in Hudson County,\" DeGise said in a speech this year.\n\nCreated in 1996, the 287(g) program peaked in 2011, with 65 local police agencies actively participating. That number dropped to 46 in 2013 amid growing concerns about its operations. A 2010 report by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general called for better training of participating officers and more thorough reporting requirements to prevent racial profiling and other civil rights violations.\n\nThe Trump administration's focus on unauthorized immigration has sparked a resurgence of interest in the program. Trump pledged to encourage more 287(g) partnerships in a Jan. 25 executive order . That was followed by a Department of Homeland Security memo pledging to \"engage immediately with all willing and qualified law enforcement jurisdictions.\"\n\nForty-one agencies have now entered into the agreements, including 11 since the presidential election.\n\nIn Frederick, the Sheriff's Office has identified 1,444 prisoners for possible deportation since it entered into a 287(g) agreement in 2008. Jenkins said that sometimes, his department identifies an unauthorized immigrant but declines to recommend deportation to ICE because the person has witnessed a crime, is pregnant, or is receiving care for a serious medical condition, among other mitigating factors. But ICE is aware of local officers' decisions, and can choose to overrule them.\n\nFeds Need Help\n\nThe new administration will need all the help it can get if it plans to deport a significant number of the estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, or even the estimated 820,000 who have been convicted of crimes .\n\nAn April report by the Homeland Security inspector general found that ICE agents are overwhelmed by their caseloads and lack clear guidelines on which arrests to prioritize.\n\nAgencies that want to help through 287(g) apply to ICE. If they are accepted into the program, they sign an agreement, which ICE can renew annually or withdraw at any time. The agreements give local officers, after they receive federal training, the right to investigate federal immigration matters under ICE supervision during the jail intake process.\n\nSome border-state sheriffs, such as A.J. \"Andy\" Louderback of Jackson County, Texas, see themselves as the first line of defense for larger cities that attract scores of immigrants. Jackson County joined the program in January, and Louderback said at least a dozen other Texas counties have plans to do the same.\n\n\"For public safety, there's no better or more effective way of checking people who come through the jail,\" Louderback said. \"It doesn't matter if they're from Mexico or Saudi Arabia. We need to find out about that person.\"\n\nBut some departments that might otherwise participate in the program have been dissuaded by the cost. Sheriff Leon Wilmot of Yuma County, Arizona, used to participate but dropped out years ago after the federal government stopped reimbursing him for staffing costs.\n\n\"I don't have the manpower. I would not use our tax dollars to do a federal function,\" Wilmot said.\n\nHarris County, Texas, dropped out of the program this year when newly elected Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the cost of paying deputies to do the work had reached $675,000 per year while staffing shortages elsewhere in the county jail were costing millions of dollars in overtime.\n\nHarris County, where Houston is located, was once the biggest producer of ICE arrests under 287(g). In 2013, the last year for which ICE released statistics, Harris County identified 1,880 immigrants for possible deportation , the largest number of the 46 agencies active in the program that year. In total, agencies participating in the program identified 15,281 unauthorized immigrants in 2013 and more than three-quarters, 11,767, were deported or left the country voluntarily.\n\nCivil Rights Concerns\n\nIn addition to the cost, some agencies are concerned about becoming vulnerable to civil rights lawsuits, said Andy Capps, director of research for the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has been fighting new 287(g) agreements, organizing protests with the help of local immigrant advocates, said Chris Rickerd, a policy attorney for the ACLU. He said the program erodes trust in local police.\n\n\"When people see a deputy in one of these programs, they no longer know whether it's an officer there they can call for help or an immigration official there to check their status. That's the core of the dilemma,\" Rickerd said.\n\nThe ACLU has also cited potential civil rights issues in opposing 287(g) agreements, despite ICE assurances that it will not tolerate racial profiling or other civil rights abuses.\n\nThe National Sheriffs' Association, which represents more than 3,000 elected sheriffs, doesn't take a position on whether sheriffs should pursue the agreements.\n\n\"We don't say it's a good program or a bad program,\" said Director Jonathan Thompson. \"We do feel it can be an effective way to allow county sheriffs to cooperate fully with ICE.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "You Listened To Children Crying At The Border. Sheriffs Listened To Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nSenior Editor, HuffPost\n\nNEW ORLEANS - As the debate over whether migrant children should be taken from their parents at the border came to a head Monday, top Trump administration officials were pleading with law enforcement officers to hop on the anti-immigration train.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen were standing before the National Sheriffs' Association conference here, demanding that peace officers stop listening to the press and start getting stricter on illegal immigration. Hours later, the world would hear an audio recording of separated children screaming and crying for their parents at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility.\n\nNielsen was fired up about asylum seekers and recent press coverage over her tweets on Sunday, in which she said of the administration's policy of separating families at the border: \"We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.\" In front of a crowd of mostly local law enforcement officials on Monday morning, she stuck by her tweets, raising the specter of human traffickers using children and policy loopholes to \"get out of jail free.\"\n\n\"We do not have the luxury of pretending that all individuals coming to this country as a family unit are in fact a family,\" she said. \"We have to do our job. We will not apologize for doing our job.\" (Two California Democrats , Sen. Kamala Harris and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , later called on Nielsen to resign.)\n\nThe Trump administration was trying to shore up support among sheriffs for hard-edged immigration enforcement. It has long been part of the president's plan to woo those elected law enforcement officials who back his immigration policy. Early last year, he invited a group of nearly a dozen sheriffs who agreed with his various immigration orders, the most divisive of which was his executive order punishing so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities asking for local jurisdictions to hand over their incarcerated undocumented immigrants.\n\nHuffPost spoke to deputies, investigators and sheriffs at the convention, some of whom wanted nothing to do with any conversation about immigration. Those who were already close to the Trump administration were willing to trumpet Sessions and his immigration policy, while others said they were just doing their jobs.\n\nKeith Cain, sheriff of Daviess County, Kentucky, said he and Sessions \"don't agree on everything,\" but he called the attorney general a \"significant partner.\" Cain, who was one of 380 sheriffs to sign a letter urging Congress to move forward on a Mexico border wall plan, also accepted the NSA's Sheriff of the Year award that morning.\n\n\"Look, we're in the people-helping business. We want to do what's right,\" Cain said. \"Sometimes you have to take a very firm position on very controversial issues. It's like that old country song: If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything.\"\n\nIn interviews with HuffPost, sheriffs from Texas and Kansas emphasized that their big issue is narcotics, a sentiment shared by at least a dozen law enforcement personnel we spoke to.\n\n\"Transnational cartels are shipping this stuff in at absolutely historic rates,\" said Kelly Rowe, sheriff of Lubbock County, Texas. \"I had a brand new K-9 officer recently hit on 40 pounds of marijuana in a vehicle. Simultaneously, another officer hits on 10 pounds of heroin in another vehicle. We're back to the late '70s and '80s in terms of the amount of narcotics people are bringing in.\"\n\nTheir business isn't necessarily in outing undocumented immigrants to the feds. But some sheriffs who spoke to HuffPost were quick to note they are cooperating fully with federal authorities. Rowe subscribes to a sort of authoritarian's idea of intersectionality: Immigration policy and drug policy, he said, go hand in hand.\n\n\"You don't have one problem without the other. Not to delve off into the immigration debate ― that's one thing ― but from our perspective, having our border secure and being able to slow and impede these cartels is big,\" he said. \"We're not here to be immigration enforcement people. We utilize ICE and Border Patrol to do their part when that stuff comes up, but those lines get blurred really quickly.\"\n\nOver in Kansas, Sherman County Sheriff Burton Pianalto is also more concerned with drug abuse issues in his community than in joining a debate on immigration.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Sheriffs Join Hate Group on Southern Border\n\nAdvocacy Director at the Center for New Community\n\nThis Friday, sheriffs from around the country will converge in McAllen, Texas, for a two-day border event led by the largest anti-immigrant hate group in the United States, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). These sheriffs will be neglecting their public duties to collude with an organization that works to advance deeply racist immigration enforcement measures and has roots in white nationalism.\n\nWhile taxpayers pay these sheriffs' salaries, they will be spending an entire workday--and perhaps longer--collaborating with a hate group instead of doing their jobs. Worse, at least one sheriff, Terry Johnson of North Carolina, is using additional public funds to cover his expenses as well as those of his staff. This anti-immigrant summit comes at a time when racial profiling and unfair enforcement practices are disproportionately affecting communities of color and immigrant communities. In recent months, we have seen police officers exposed for their affiliations with extremist hate groups. Even stricter scrutiny must be applied to public officials who use work hours or public funds to collaborate with a known hate group.\n\nUnfortunately, this border event is hardly unique. It is part and parcel of a much broader trend of sheriffs working closely with FAIR to advance a decidedly anti-immigrant agenda. In fact, FAIR has already insinuated itself into the good graces of a national network of sheriffs. Sheriffs are useful to FAIR and the broader anti-immigrant movement as respected supporters of their extreme policy positions who can influence state and local legislatures or even directly adopt anti-immigrant policies in their policing. These sheriffs speak at FAIR events, adopt FAIR talking points, and work with FAIR on state and local policies. In past years, sheriffs have come from across the country to participate in this border summit. Some of the same officials are likely to be there this year.\n\nFor instance, Sheriff Chuck Jenkins of Frederick County, Maryland, has a history of collaborating with FAIR, including attending last year's event . It's no coincidence that he has also become well known as an advocate for harsh immigration enforcement measures. Frederick County is the only county in Maryland that maintains a 287(g) agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a controversial program that allows local law enforcement agents to carry out federal immigration policy. Sheriff Tom Hodgson of Bristol County, Massachusetts, has similarly worked with FAIR. He has publicly disparaged undocumented immigrants, accusing them of \"creating public health hazards\" and \"public safety concerns.\"\n\nThe stakes are high, as the most notorious anti-immigrant sheriff, Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Arizona, has demonstrated. His anti-immigrant policing tactics, including racial profiling, have led to flagrant violations of constitutional rights and countless family separations and are projected to cost taxpayers $50 million in fees.\n\nSo what exactly will sheriffs be doing at this border summit? FAIR advertises the summit as an education and training event featuring presentations on terrorism, drug cartels, so-called sanctuary cities, and more, no doubt designed to stoke fear about immigrants. That's bad enough, but the event will also feature a border tour and social event with the founders of the Texas Border Volunteers, a border vigilante group that has been accused of violating the law . An offshoot of the notorious Minutemen movement, Texas Border Volunteers has unsuccessfully tried to distance itself from the extremist label. The group is known to unlawfully detain people, effectively operating as a militia. Sheriffs attending the Summit will have a BBQ on the ranch of Linda Vickers, a founder of the group who has bragged about sending her dogs out to chase immigrants. FAIR is making possible the collaboration between local sheriffs and the Texas Border Volunteers, which can be read as a disturbing endorsement of their extra-judicial practices. That should concern each and every resident of the counties policed by sheriffs who work with FAIR.\n\nCollusion between elected officials, especially those tasked with protecting public safety, and a recognized hate group violates values that Americans claim to hold dear: fairness, equality, and the right to be judged by our actions--not our race, religion, national origin, or immigration status.\n\nResidents must call on their local sheriffs to cut ties with FAIR and disavow all extremist anti-immigrant policies and practices. It's the only way to begin making our communities truly safe for all.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Sheriffs From 3 States Join Forces To Take Aim At Colorado's Marijuana Law\n\nStaff Reporter, The Huffington Post\n\nWASHINGTON -- Twelve sheriffs from three states said in a lawsuit filed Thursday that Colorado's law legalizing marijuana for recreational use creates a \"crisis of conscience\" by forcing them to uphold state law when their oath of office also includes a promise to uphold the federal Constitution.\n\nAt a press conference after the suit was filed, a handful of those sheriffs -- from Colorado, Nebraska and Kansas -- said they hoped the courts could determine whether the Constitution's supremacy clause would pre-empt Amendment 64, which Colorado voters approved in 2012. More than 330 licensed marijuana dispensaries now operate in Colorado, more than a year after the law went into effect on Jan. 1, 2014.\n\n\"I'm first and foremost a law man and one of my primary responsibilities is to defend the rule of law,\" Colorado's Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith said. \"Amendment 64 created a constitutional showdown and that showdown was destined for a courtroom from the moment the last ballot was cast in the state.\"\n\nChad Day, sheriff of Colorado's Yuma County, framed the case as one that seeks clarification from the courts for a question \"that needs to be answered.\"\n\n\"This puts us in an untenable position -- by supporting and upholding one law, we're violating the other, and vice versa,\" he said.\n\nSheriffs from the neighboring states of Nebraska and Kansas said their local law enforcement budgets were \"burdened\" by marijuana that has shown up in their counties. In December, Nebraska and Oklahoma filed a lawsuit arguing that federal law prohibits the production and sale of marijuana, and should take precedence over the will of Colorado voters.\n\n\"We are forced away from what we're usually doing to deal with Colorado-sourced marijuana,\" said Sheriff Mark Overman of Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska, citing increased expenditures for incarcerating those arrested. \"Legalization has completely changed the landscape involving the marijuana that we encounter ... the potency is off the charts, it is the best marijuana in the world.\"\n\nOverman added that he thought increased emergency room visits in Colorado and traffic fatalities in which marijuana may have been a factor weren't being noticed outside the region.\n\n\"The media has focused on the feel-good stories and they are ignoring what's happening on the ground out there,\" he said. \"We think that what Colorado has done is illegal and it's unconstitutional. I believe that this case is going to have national ramifications, and if we win then we can reverse what is looking like a surrender to the pro-marijuana crowd.\"\n\nColorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana, and more jurisdictions could follow, as a majority of Americans now support legalization . Though such laws remain illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act, the Department of Justice said in 2013 that prosecutors should avoid targeting marijuana operations that are legal in the states in which they reside.\n\nLast month, an anti-drug group filed a suit targeting a number of Colorado lawmakers, including Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, Revenue Department Executive Director Barbara Brohl and Marijuana Enforcement Division Director W. Lewis Koski, alleging that by allowing for a regulated marijuana market, the lawmakers were breaking federal law. Participants in the state's marijuana industry were also named as defendants.\n\nIf the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of any of the challenges to Colorado's law, all state marijuana laws, in any form, could be in danger of collapsing.\n\nDespite the sheriffs' concerns, a report released last year from the Brookings Institution concluded that the implementation of the new laws has been largely successful . The state's marijuana industry is valued around $700 million per year.\n\nKevin Sabet, the president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an anti-legalization group, said in a statement Thursday that \"Big Marijuana must be feeling the heat.\"\n\n\"The legalization of marijuana is not implemented in a vacuum,\" he continued. \"The current policy of denial about federal law is untenable. Surrounding states have seen a surge in marijuana-related trafficking activity. Dealers and traffickers are openly bragging about how they have been able to smuggle state-sanctioned marijuana out of Colorado. The underground market has thrived under Amendment 64, and ever-potent gummy bears, candies, and concentrates have flooded the national marijuana market.\"\n\nMason Tvert, the communications director for the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project, compared the sheriffs suing Colorado to Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who decided to ignore a federal ruling allowing same-sex marriage in his state .\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Donald Trump Invites Sheriffs Who Love Him And His Immigration Views To The White House\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Justice Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump has asked a group of nearly a dozen sheriffs - many of whom are vocal Trump supporters - to come to the White House Tuesday morning to discuss law enforcement issues, including his executive orders on immigration.\n\nThe group is expected to include a Wyoming sheriff who suggested Muslim terrorists were coming over the U.S.-Mexico border, a Texas sheriff who admired Trump for \"saying what the American people want to hear,\" and a Minnesota sheriff who praised Trump for sparking a \"patriot spring\" that he compared to the Arab Spring , the pro-democracy uprisings in the Middle East.\n\nAlso on the invite list is the sheriff of Orange County, a law enforcement agency that is currently the subject of a federal civil rights investigation over a tainted jailhouse informant program that has allegedly violated the rights of numerous defendants for decades.\n\nA spokesman for the National Sheriffs' Association, or NSA, who provided the list of attendees to The Huffington post, said the meeting is expected to last around 45 minutes to an hour. It will partly focus on immigration , including Trump's executive order punishing so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal deportation efforts. The sheriffs also plan to talk about mental health of inmates in jails and a program that permits the federal government to transfer military supplies to local law enforcement, according to the NSA spokesman.\n\nThe people invited to meet with Trump on Tuesday include a combination of leadership chosen by the NSA and specific people the White House requested, the NSA spokesman told HuffPost. A White House spokeswoman said they would release a list of attendees and a readout of the meeting after it concludes on Tuesday.\n\nOne sheriff invited to the meeting, Laramie County Sheriff Danny Glick, warned that people he labelled \"OTMs\" - \"other than Mexicans\" - were making their way over the border. \"Sheriff Glick said he knows law enforcement in the southwest border states have found evidence of OTMs, such as Islamic prayer rugs and Korans, while investigating immigrant camps,\" the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported last year . The fact-checking organization PolitiFact has labeled claims that Islamic prayer rugs were found along the border \"pants on fire wrong.\" Glick also criticized the NFL for allowing Beyoncé to perform at the Super Bowl last year, when members of the association watching the game at their 2016 winter meeting turned off her performance .\n\nAnd in December 2015 - days after Trump first publicly proposed banning Muslims from traveling to the U.S. - Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson from Texas responded by noting that \"the only way we can have a meaningful immigration policy is for us to first secure our borders.\"\n\nAnother potential attendee is Sheriff Caroline \"Bunny\" Welsh, an early Trump supporter who served on the Trump campaign's Pennsylvania women leadership team and said the \"energy and the enthusiasm for Mr. Trump was something I have never seen before.\"\n\nTrump is also slated to meet with at least one Democrat, Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall from Tennessee, a reform-minded law enforcement official who has focused on lowering the jail population and is supportive of the decriminalization of marijuana possession.\n\nMilwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, a prominent and controversial Trump supporter who had been discussed for a potential role in the administration, will not be in D.C. for the meeting, a spokeswoman told HuffPost.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

They have leeway, for example, over the extent to which they cooperate with federal immigration authorities, which includes deciding whether to hold undocumented immigrants in jail for longer than their initial charges allow. Trump has vocally criticized localities that don't agree with him on this issue.\n\nThe National Sheriffs' Association, which also has its winter meeting in D.C. this week, represents more than 3,000 elected sheriffs across the United States, and leans conservative. When an Obama administration task force recommended a \"soft look\" for officers policing protests in 2015, the former president of the association trotted out a vest with \"a fuzzy boa attached to the straps of the vest and a red target on the back,\" according to a report in the Daily Caller. After Trump's election, the group praised him for his \"strong support for law enforcement.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But after their heroic rescue of a birthday party for a boy with autism, they might want to give it some serious thought.\n\nGlenn Buratti turned 6 last Sunday , and was eager to celebrate with a party, as first reported by the Osceola News-Gazette. Every member of his class at school was invited -- but when party time arrived, guests did not.\n\nMom Ashlee Buratti said she was crestfallen.\n\n\"From the minute he woke up that day he wanted to know how many minutes until his friends came. None of the kids' parents RSVP'd, but I was still holding on to the hope that some of them would show up. It never crossed my mind that it would be zero ,\" Buratti told the News-Gazette.\n\nThe frustrated mother took to Facebook to vent on an Osceola community page . \"I know this might be something silly to rant about,\" she wrote , \"but my heart is breaking for my son. We invited his whole class (16 kids) over for his 6th birthday party today. Not one kid came.\"\n\nTo Buratti's amazement, members of the 10,000-strong Facebook group, including the Osceola County Sheriff's Office , immediately began to respond with positive messages.\n\nOrlando news outlet WKMG reports OCSO deputies not only orchestrated a helicopter flyover , but pooled money and purchased gifts for Glenn. Strangers stopped by with presents, their own kids in tow. Buratti told the News-Gazette that one woman bought Glenn a brand new bike.\n\nLater in the week, sheriff's deputies stopped by again with squad cars, motorcycles, and a SWAT vehicle for Glenn to check out; the fire department reportedly brought a fire truck.\n\n\"We got to the stop sign by our house and Glenn was like, 'The fire truck's at our house!'\" Buratti told CBS News . \"I said, 'It's okay, they're there to tell you happy birthday.'\"\n\nThanks to the community and all of the public officials who pitched in, Glenn seems to have had an amazing birthday after all.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Their campaigns are being backed by Sheriffs for Trusting Communities, a North Carolina-based political group that wants to boost the work started by community organizations like Casa in Action in Virginia, Action NC and Comunidad Colectiva in North Carolina, and Poder in Action in Arizona. In East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the group is backing Democrat Charles \"Carlos\" Jean Jr., who is running for sheriff in November. The organization is seeking to bring full circle the movement that's ushered reformers to prosecutorial offices from Philadelphia to St. Louis, by harnessing the energy of grassroots organizers who have been fundamentally altering the traditional role of the law enforcement officers, and by extension, the system itself.\n\nIn recent years, district attorneys races have become a key part of the criminal justice reform movement and drawn in high-profile candidates, donors, and endorsements, as well as a lot of public attention. Organizers from groups like Real Justice PAC, Color of Change PAC, the Working Families Party, and local chapters of the Democratic Socialists of America have helped to solidify a movement around district attorneys' races, and they've had a promising selection of progressive candidates to choose from.\n\nIn sheriffs' races, meanwhile, such groups have focused more on ousting conservative incumbents than cultivating and recruiting their ideal progressive candidate, and have yet to build the same kind of traction that exists around prosecutorial campaigns. There are signs that is beginning to change, though.\n\n\"There hasn't been a lot of organizing around criminal justice issues of the really hyperlocal level until much more recently,\" said Rebecca Neusteter, who directs the policing program at the Vera Institute of Justice, which focuses on criminal justice issues. \"For a long time, much of this work was very much focused on the national and the federal spotlight, really trying to understand prison and populations at state and federal levels. And I think for the past number of years, there's been a growing appreciation that state and federal populations and policies actually have a pretty limited role in the drive of criminal justice operations and reforms, that much more of this work is local.\"\n\nThe movement around police accountability has been much more visible, Neusteter said, but has tended to result in measures like retraining police officers and monitoring their activity, rather than reforming policies that lead them to unnecessary interactions with civilians. \"There has obviously been a lot of attention paid locally around policing issues, but it tends to focus on the really tragic and slain use of force cases, or in isolated incidents around trying to organize the community or public oversight of police, as opposed to recognizing the real thread between policing and mass incarceration.\"\n\nAs more attention is focused on the role sheriffs play in the broader criminal justice system, more money is being poured into such races. Billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros has spent millions on both prosecutorial and sheriffs races over the past five years, including $2 million to defeat former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in 2016 and $1.7 million to elect Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner in 2017. Soros's Democracy PAC also recently gave $50,000 to King. Sheriffs for Trusting Communities - which is backed in part by Data for Progress, a left-wing think tank - has introduced small-dollar online fundraising to sheriffs' elections in the hopes of building out infrastructure and enthusiasm around such races.\n\nThe candidates emphasize that what happens on the local level is just as essential as the decisions being made in the General Assembly. \"As the sheriff, you can propose legislation. If you say, we need better gun legislation, and you're the sheriff of Loudoun County or whatever county, people will listen to you,\" Hannah said. \"So these local races are very important as well.\"\n\nThose rallying for more progressive sheriffs had success last year in North Carolina, where Comunidad Colectiva led the charge to mobilize communities around ending sheriffs' cooperation with 287(g) . Organizers focused on overlaps between how law enforcement interacts with communities of immigrants and people of color. They also helped elect Garry McFadden as Mecklenburg County sheriff, with a campaign focused on ending the office's cooperation with the program. Four other Democratic sheriffs elected last year announced that they would be making similar changes to how their offices work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"Bad sheriffs govern in great places,\" reads one message on the Sheriffs for Trusting Communities site . The organization refers frequently to Arpaio, who is notorious for using the office of the sheriff to advance an anti-immigrant agenda. Organizers who worked against Arpaio, who was considering seeking reelection in Arizona last year, set the vision for what the sheriff's initiative is all about, Max Rose, the group's founder and executive director, told The Intercept. Arpaio announced in August that he plans to run for another term in 2020.\n\n\"Arizona was, I guess, kind of a petri dish for cities and for states across the country,\" said Poder in Action Executive Director Viri Hernandez. \"So we became ground zero.\" Hernandez, who has led the group for six years, explained that conservative immigration policies were tried first in Arizona, where Arpaio played a key role in their implementation. Arpaio, who had been in office since being elected in 1992, openly advocated for policies that aggressively targeted immigrants in the early 2000s, requesting permission to cooperate with ICE, holding his own raids, and creating volunteer \" posses \" to carrying them out.\n\nThe people Arpaio was targeting were the ones who began the movement that eventually ousted him in 2016, Hernandez said. She and her parents, who came to the United States undocumented, were among the volunteers knocking on doors for the 2016 election. \"Arpaio raided my dad's job in 2014,\" she said. He wasn't at work at the time, \"but they took his file, and that completely shifted our life.\" Her family left the house within a matter of weeks and moved to another city. A lawsuit later found the raid unconstitutional.\n\nAlthough beating Arpaio in 2016 was a huge success for the movement, the current Democratic sheriff isn't all that different, Hernandez said. And she's not sure they'll have the kind of progressive candidate they'd like to see in time for the 87-year-old's 2020 run.\n\nOrganizers are seeking to replicate the movement against Arpaio in other states by drawing connections between law enforcements' interactions with both immigrants and communities of color.\n\nKing, who is running against Republican incumbent Glendell Hill, is the first Democrat to run for Prince William County sheriff in nearly 16 years. It will be his third election since 2015. Virginia's Democratic Party recruited King to run for the House of Delegates in 2015, and he ran twice unsuccessfully in the past three years, losing by less than a point to his Democratic primary opponent in both 2015 and again in 2017. The local party recruited him last year to challenge Hill.\n\nHe wants to end the sheriff's office's cooperation with the controversial 287(g) program, which deputizes local police to work with federal immigration enforcement agents. (Prince Williams County is one of two Virginia counties that participate in the program.) King is a former deputy sheriff, an Iraq War veteran, and a leader of his union, the local SEIU Virginia 512.\n\nHe also wants to improve diversity among officers and make sure that they're given proper competency training for how to engage with people with disabilities or mental illness. King's teenage daughter is autistic and nonverbal; he said he worries about what would happen if she came into contact with law enforcement who didn't know she had a disability.\n\nKing recognizes that the race is something of an uphill battle. \"He has lots of name ID because they know who he is,\" he said of his opponent, who has been in law enforcement since 1969 and is seeking a fifth term as sheriff. \"But a lot of people are telling me that he's a nice guy, but they're ready for change. That he's been in too long. That's the honest answer. But they're ready for change, they want to see some progress, and they want to see something new.\"\n\nThe Democrat points out that in addition to Hill's support for 287(g), his attitude toward incarceration and sentencing is out of place in a state that's relatively blue and where Democrats are becoming more and more progressive . In recent years, Hill has distanced himself from Virginia Republican Corey Stewart, who chairs the Prince William County Board of Supervisors and has advocated for the 287(g) program, saying that he wanted to \"hunt down\" undocumented immigrants. Hill said there was no need to be \"mean spirited\" toward immigrants but that it was important to enforce the law\n\nHill has raised close to $68,000 so far this cycle, while King's campaign has raised more than $90,000. Prior to the $50,000 contribution from Democracy PAC, King's campaign had raised around $42,000 as of September, his campaign said. The majority of that came from Casa in Action, an immigrant rights group that is spending $22,000 on canvassing efforts for King's campaign and has volunteers knocking doors for him every week. Both the SEIU and the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 donated to King, $2,000 and $1,000 respectively, which helped them pay for mailers, the campaign said.\n\nIt's important for Democratic donors to pay attention to local races, said King's campaign manager Katie Baker. \"You're building a bench for people who are going to run for state legislature and potentially Congress later, so you've got to be thinking about the long game,\" she said. People might think holding local office is just about taking care of barking dogs and zoning violations, but \"something like 287(g) - that policy absolutely is impacting people.\"\n\nOne challenge will be turning out voters in off-year elections, said Hannah, who could become Loudoun County's first black sheriff if he defeats incumbent Michael Chapman, who is backed by Correct Care Solutions, a for-profit company that provides health care in state prisons and has been in office since January 2012.\n\nLoudoun County has voted Democratic in presidential elections since Barack Obama's first run in 2008, but it's more difficult to turn out voters in off-year elections, in which the county skews more conservative in local elections. \"Loudoun is actually a very blue county, it's just a matter of getting out the votes. And we haven't been able to do that in these off-year elections,\" said Hannah, who ran briefly for a state Senate seat earlier this year before launching his campaign for sheriff.\n\nHannah has zeroed in on his opponent's anti-immigrant posturing, pointing to Chapman's 2016 appearance in a video from the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform, touting how important law enforcement officers are in enforcing immigration law. \"He's been on TV with President Trump talking about immigration and how he has very close ties with ICE, and he's willing to work with them,\" Hannah said.\n\nOriginal reporting.

      "text": "Hundreds of Activists and Elected Officials Call on Mayors and Cops to Decrease Police Power\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMore than 200 people sent letters to mayors, police chiefs, and county and sheriffs' associations on Friday demanding concrete policy changes to policing.\n\nIn the wake of unprecedented civil action across the country after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, more than 200 people representing civil rights organizations, community organizers, elected officials, and public defenders sent letters to mayors, police chiefs, and county and sheriffs' associations on Friday, asking them to take immediate action to decrease police presence and refocus on a good-faith effort to restore public safety.\n\nThe letters, sent to associations representing mayors, police chiefs, sheriffs, and county boards, outline policy proposals that mirror the demands protesters have been making in response to the police killings of Floyd, Breonna Taylor , Dreasjon Reed , Tony McDade , Ahmaud Arbery (killed by a former cop), and David McAtee .\n\n\"The solutions we need right now both to protect our safety and to rescue our democracy are ones that meet the scale of the problem,\" read the letters, which were sent to the National Sheriffs' Association , the United States Conference of Mayors , National Association of Counties , and the Major Cities Chiefs Association . To respond to recent police killings, it goes on, \"we must replace the questions about how to reform policing with questions about what a broader vision for safety and justice in America should look like and what role policing should play in it.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSignatories on the letters, which were led by the Justice Collaborative, a policy group that advocates for changes to the criminal justice system, include San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin and New York state Sen. Julia Salazar, along with hundreds of academics, faith leaders, and other organizers.\n\nThe proposals focus on five areas of efforts to radically reform the police state including defunding police and reprioritizing budgets, ending \"no knock\" raids, providing funding for non-law enforcement emergency responders, making police union negotiations public, and implementing community-based violence prevention solutions.\n\nThe demand to end \"no knock\" raids comes in the wake of the Louisville Metro Police Department's killing of Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT. She was shot on March 13 at least eight times in her home after police conducting a drug raid entered the wrong house on an illegal no-knock warrant. Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, reportedly fired back at the intruders entering their home and was arrested immediately. He was charged with attempted murder of a police officer. The charges were later dropped, and Walker was released from home incarceration on May 26.\n\nThe letter is in stark contrast to the praise being heaped on law enforcement by major media organizations, mayors of major metropolitan cities - like Bill de Blasio, whose daughter was arrested and doxxed by the New York Police Department - and President Donald Trump, even as police have responded to protests with brute force. Organizers who signed the letter say their approach is the most productive and least harmful.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\n\"Praising the police is not, in my view, the answer at the moment,\" said Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University. \"In a way, the best way to sort of pay homage to [Floyd's] memory, and to really effectuate the wishes of the protesters, and to really promote some meaningful reform, is to act now ... while people are listening, and people's eyes are open to these issues.\"\n\nRather than praising law enforcement, Medwed said, the answer is to get \"at the underlying causes of police brutality, especially with respect to African Americans. And it ties in directly to systemic racism and institutionalized racism. And maybe as we work toward minimizing the centuries of discrimination that have created that situation, while we're doing that, and having those conversations, we also have to, I think, address the immediate issue of police brutality.\"\n\nThe recent spate of police shootings has highlighted a split between activists and scholars who have long advocated for prison and police abolition , and those who believe in piecemeal reforms, like use of force and bias trainings - or what abolitionist and prison scholar Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls \"reformist reforms.\"\n\nNon-reformist reforms seek abolition as an end goal, and include defunding and demilitarizing the police - a demand that has long been considered politically impossible but has entered mainstream discourse over the last week and is reflected in the letters sent Friday.\n\nThe letter to police chiefs asks them to help curb the power of police unions. \"Making sure that unions aren't as powerful so that you can keep bad apples on the force, and prevent robust oversight and disciplinary action,\" Medwed said.\n\nCities across the country are reeling, not just because of the most recent killings, but because of a long history of the same disturbing incidents of police brutality with little to no accountability, Medwed said, citing a handful of cases going back more than 20 years, including the rape in police custody of a Haitian immigrant in 1997 and the more recent killing of Eric Garner in New York City.\n\n\"Every city has its own slate of issues,\" Medwed said. \"But there is this common theme and common ground here that does relate to the police in the United States having too much power, being too heavily weaponized, and being too protected by their unions. And that's what's really undergirding this letter: this idea of finding common ground and striking while the iron is hot.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The Biometric Frontier\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"Show Me Your Papers\" Becomes \"Open Your Eyes\" as Border Sheriffs Expand Iris Surveillance\n\nS ince his inauguration, President Donald Trump has found little funding for his \" big, beautiful wall .\" In the meantime, however, another acquisition promised to deter unauthorized immigrants is coming to the border: iris recognition devices. Thirty-one sheriffs, representing every county along the U.S.-Mexico border, voted unanimously on April 3 to adopt tools that will capture, catalogue, and compare individuals' iris data, for use both in jails and out on patrol. Biometric Intelligence and Identification Technologies , the company behind the push, has offered the sheriffs a free three-year trial, citing law enforcement's difficulties in identifying unauthorized immigrants whose fingerprints can be disfigured through manual labor or self-inflicted wounds.\n\nIris recognition is just the latest surveillance technology helping fortify what the White House hopes will make up a \"digital wall,\" a concept that many border sheriffs view as less intrusive than Trump's envisioned 30-foot barricade stretching from Brownsville, Texas, to San Diego, California. For law enforcement, the tool promises to help identify people without reliable fingerprints and to deter repeat border crossers. And for Biometric Intelligence and Identification Technologies, which frequently goes by BI2, rapid border expansion means its existing national iris database will receive a huge influx of biometric information on unauthorized immigrants, boosting its product's capabilities to potential law enforcement clients across the country.\n\nWhile this high-tech approach to immigration enforcement has not generated anything close to the controversy of Trump's proposed wall, the campaign to expand iris scan collection on the border is of a piece with the president's denunciations of Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals.\n\nAccording to John Leonard, senior vice president of BI2, the company's decision to give away this technology was, in part, motivated by law enforcement's alleged struggles with violent unauthorized immigrants. \"The frustration law enforcement has is this: 'Alright, I got this criminal, the guy raped three kids. He's back in my community again. I don't even know who he is, and the federal government has never given me what I need,'\" Leonard said during a video call with The Intercept.\n\n\"You get all these people that say, 'Well Trump is going after all these illegals, these immigrants, who have made America great.' Well there's a lot of immigrants that have made it great, but there's a lot of assholes, too,\" he said. \"So BI2 is stepping up to the plate and donating this.\"\n\nJohn Leonard, senior vice president of Biometric Intelligence and Identification Technologies.\n\nI n the coming months, BI2's iris recognition devices will be installed in every sheriff's department along the U.S.-Mexico border. Each department will receive both a stationary iris capture device for inmate intake facilities and, eventually, a mobile version, according to Sheriff Joe Frank Martinez of Val Verde County, Texas, who currently serves as the president of the Southwestern Border Sheriff's Coalition.\n\nThe technology works by taking a high-resolution image of a person's iris with a special infrared illumination camera, and then creating an individualized iris template based on that image. The templates exploit nearly 240 unique characteristic elements in the iris, compared to the 40 to 60 used for fingerprints, resulting in far fewer false matches. To make an identification, BI2's iris recognition program compares an individual's iris against the over 987,000 iris scans held in its private database, which collects images from over 180 law enforcement jurisdictions nationwide.\n\nIn May, I traveled to Wayne County, North Carolina, to observe the sheriff's department's new BI2 iris unit in action. Sgt. Delbert Edwards, an older man in gray, stood at his computer terminal, instructing me to step about eight inches away from a small black lens mounted on a counter. Three red lights flashed in my left eye, then a blue one. Edwards beckoned me to tilt my head back, and suddenly, a green dot popped onto the screen. The camera reflexively tilted upward, having taken what it needed from me. \"Right, there you go, perfect,\" Edwards said, glancing at a window on his screen where black and white images of my disembodied eyes stared back at him.\n\nEdwards then watched as a green bar zipped back and forth under the iris image, checking against an inmate he picked at random and against hundreds of thousands of other irises captured from inmates across the country. After 20 seconds a message appeared: \"Individual was not verified, and the irises didn't match anybody else.\" Behind the message was an image of the county inmate Edwards tested my iris against. On the screen, I could see a woman with brown hair, an orange jumpsuit, and a blank stare.\n\nAfter scanning the iris, an image appears on the Mobile Offender Recognition and Information System for comparison in a central database.\n\nS heriff Omar Lucio of Cameron County, Texas, is a big fan of BI2's iris system. He will be one of the first border sheriffs using it. When I met Lucio in April, the white-haired sheriff sported a dark brown uniform with a cross of gold buttons and a shiny badge over his heart. Above his old-school mustache, his eyes twinkled as he praised the coming iris installation.\n\n\"The wall is not going to prevent it. Technology is the way to go,\" Lucio said, referring to unauthorized immigration. \"It's not unusual for people caught illegally from Mexico to give fake names and date of births. But it doesn't matter what you use if we have your features - your iris, your fingerprints. You can use a hundred different names. We still can say, 'This is the guy.'\"\n\nMartinez, the head of the Southwestern Border Sheriff's Coalition, hopes that the mobile version of BI2's iris scanners will help his deputies when out in the field along the border in Val Verde County. \"Let's say you have an individual who doesn't want to identify himself. If he's not suspected of anything, without this tool, we would let him go,\" Martinez said in a phone call with The Intercept. \"But if we are able to get the iris scanned out in the field, having some probable cause to do so, we can find out if there's something on him.\"\n\nThe templates generated from iris images taken with BI2's mobile application can be compared against hundreds of thousands of other iris templates in just under 20 seconds. The scans are also automatically saved into BI2's national database, BI2's Leonard confirmed in an email to The Intercept. Leonard, however, cautioned that ambient light could in some cases interfere with the capture process outdoors.\n\nGiving law enforcement the ability to check and collect people's irises for criminal history and, in effect, their citizenship information during stops could lead to racial profiling, said Nathan Wessler, staff attorney with the Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"In this country, we've long resisted being a 'show me your papers' society, but this moves us to that because you increasingly can't avoid your identity being scooped up in public,\" Wessler told The Intercept. \"Racial profiling is a serious concern, especially Latinos or people of color are at greater risk for iris checks simply for the color of their skin.\"\n\nThe 31 border counties' acquisition of these tools will also help rapidly build up BI2's private iris database. At present, the database is housed by a third-party vendor in an undisclosed location in San Antonio, Texas, and in three other disaster backup facilities. The database is the largest of its kind in North America, according to Leonard.\n\nThe bigger the database, the more valuable it becomes to law enforcement. \"If he doesn't have any criminal record before, you don't have anything. But once we do this\" - scan the iris - \"we're going to have that record. We're enrolling and you're going to be there,\" said Lucio, the Cameron County sheriff, of a hypothetical detainee. \"When he's arrested, even if he gave you a fake name at the beginning, he's not going to fool anybody because his record is there.\"\n\nAdam Schwartz, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation's civil liberties team, said local law enforcement should not be collecting biometric data to help federal immigration agencies, like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"Just because you are walking in a border town and a cop says, 'Hey, can I talk to you?' you have no diminished expectations of privacy, and your biometrics should not be collected,\" Schwartz told The Intercept. \"Whatever legitimate interest police have in capturing biometrics to do ordinary law enforcement jobs, it is not proper to share that information with ICE.\" Currently, ICE has direct access to many law enforcement databases .\n\nLucio acknowledged such technological improvements will put unauthorized immigrants at far greater risk for prison time. \"No question about it. Some people have been arrested and they're coming from across or from another county, so not going to give you any kind of a name,\" Lucio said. \"They know if you're arrested a second time, it's a federal crime\" - referring to the stiff federal charges for immigrants caught re-entering the country without authorization.\n\nKelly Lytle Hernandez, an associate professor in the University of California, Los Angeles's history department, argues the legal consequences of this development tie in to a much larger story about the U.S.-Mexico border. \"It's particularly interesting that this technology is being sold as a way to identify 'chronic offenders' of unauthorized re-entry, a crime that was invented in 1929 by Coleman Livingston Blease, a white supremacist senator from South Carolina who wanted to control the in-flow of Mexicans,\" Hernandez said in an interview. \"Any technology promising to ratchet up unauthorized re-entry charges is obviously wrapped up in that history.\"\n\nPeople walk on the international bridge at the U.S-Mexico border in Nuevo Laredo, in northern Mexico, on Feb. 22, 2017.\n\nB I2's expansionary push along the border comes on the heels of new business opportunities presented by Trump's immigration enforcement push. On April 12, the Southwestern Border Sheriff's Coalition, the group BI2 is partnering with in its three-year iris scan pilot program, requested a grant of $750,000 from the Department of Justice to \"improve and expand the biometric identification capabilities of the 31 sheriff's offices along the U.S. and Mexico border.\" In a phone call, Leonard told The Intercept that such grant negotiations are \"strictly between the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the sheriffs,\" adding, \"It's their money and they can allocate it as they propose.\"\n\nHowever, according to a source familiar with the negotiations, a week after the sheriffs' grant request was issued, Susan Richmond Johnson, a lobbyist with John Ashcroft's TAG Holdings , attempted to set up meetings about the request with Danielle Cutrona, a senior adviser to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and some sheriffs. Johnson hoped to bring BI2 president Sean Mullin into an eventual follow-up meeting, according to the source, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the matter and feared professional reprisal. TAG Holdings is an investor in BI2 and Johnson was an adviser to Ashcroft when he was attorney general during the Bush administration. Neither Johnson nor Mullin responded to The Intercept's requests for comment.\n\nLeonard did not confirm if any such follow-up took place. While some border sheriffs had a call with Justice Department officials about the grant request in the final week of May, he said, \"We as a vendor are not able to listen in.\"\n\nOver the last 12 years years, BI2's introduction of iris technology into law enforcement departments across the country has been gradual. In contrast to other countries, especially in the developing world, law enforcement agencies in the U.S. have far less incentive to switch to iris identification because so much fingerprinting infrastructure already exists. \"Other countries are developing from the ground up, so iris is appealing because it is considered one of the most accurate and stable biometrics across time,\" said Clare Garvie, a fellow at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law, in a phone call with The Intercept. \"Here, we have legacy databases of faces and fingerprints, so the cost and time to deploy those biometric systems is much lower and more appealing.\"\n\nThe long-standing use of other biometric systems in law enforcement circles has meant that private sector companies like BI2 play a large role in pushing iris identification infrastructure. Law enforcement officials say they don't worry about the security of the biometric data they collect because BI2 is in charge of holding it for them. \"The data is on the server, which is managed by BI2, so we don't have to manage any data of that sort,\" said Binit Nagori, an IT staffer at the Washington, D.C., Department of Corrections. \"Our officers just scan it and send it to them. We do not worry about the data. I believe BI2 has the data in a national database.\"\n\nSchwartz, the EFF lawyer, worries that law enforcement agencies are not doing enough to ensure residents' sensitive data is protected. \"If the government is saying we just capture the data, push a button, and vendor takes care of it, that is wholly inadequate,\" he said. \"Every time the data is stored or transmitted there is a risk of breach. And, unlike an address or social security number, you can't change your iris. So if the government is going to purchase tools from vendors that amass biometric data, it is necessary that they employ privacy officers who know how to prevent security breaches and move the data securely.\"\n\nThis private sector leadership in the adoption of iris tools, however, means that BI2 enjoys far more access to and control over criminal justice data than one might expect. Sitting in his cabin in North Carolina, Leonard shared a screen with me and used BI2's interface to log into two law enforcement databases - one in Washington, D.C., and the other in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana.\n\n\"Give me the last name of anybody you think might be in the jail,\" Leonard instructed me while he was logged into the D.C. Department of Corrections database.\n\n\"Garcia,\" I said.\n\nHe typed in the name Garcia, and a list of inmates popped up, one of whom he selected at random. A new screen then appeared showing the mug shot of a man whose race category was labeled \"H.\" Next to this image, on my screen, I could also see fields for his social security number, date of birth, gender, booking number, and a few other categories, which, for other mugshots, were filled out but left blank on this entry. Leonard moved on to pick another inmate to show me how iris verification would work.\n\nLeonard clicked on another inmate. \"He's a white guy, OK, he's one of the only white guys I could find basically,\" said Leonard, who then scanned his own eyes, adding them to the program. After about 20 seconds, gray images of Leonard's eyes disappeared from my screen and a message popped up noting that his irises did not match those of the inmate. The message said the user on the system could click to see the real identity of the irises. Leonard then clicked through and an image of him, sitting in his cabin wearing a hoodie, appeared on the screen.\n\n\"This is why it would be important on the border,\" Leonard said. \"Because as you build, people lie all the time.\"\n\nCameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio speaks to the media at a conference on July 20, 2016, in Brownsville, Texas.\n\nM uch like Trump on the campaign trail , BI2 and some border sheriffs highlight notorious stories of violent criminal immigrants to argue for iris identification. During my visit to Cameron County, for example, Lucio mentioned the story of Angel Maturino Resendiz , a serial killer from Mexico who was executed by Texas in 2006.\n\n\"I'll give you a true story that happened with an individual that was from Mexico, so you know about it. He was called the railroad rapist, or killer, OK?\" said Lucio, who paused, unable to remember the story exactly. Beckoning to a nearby deputy to remind him of the character, Lucio continued, \"Rodriguez was known as the railroad killer, Mike, or rapist?\" The deputy leaned in close to his ear and told him the character's real name.\n\n\"Yeah, it was Resendiz, wasn't it?\" Lucio said, now confident in his recollection. \"This guy was from Mexico, a young guy, and he used to ride the railroads. And he would go to a place or city or what have you, and he would probably rape somebody or kill. So he was picked up several times, but he would give a false name and then he would be released, so by the time we get the information ... the individual would be released, cross here, take off, and go back to Mexico and come back again. I think he killed about three or four people like that.\"\n\nLeonard showed me two images of a dark-skinned, middle-aged man with a buzz cut in an orange and gray jumpsuit. Under each mug shot was a different Hispanic or Latino name, and above each was a small thumbnail of a hand with crimson splotches cut across his fingertips.\n\n\"Now it's obvious looking at the two people that this is the same guy, no question about that,\" Leonard continued, scrolling his mouse between the two images of the inmate. \"But he had surgically cut his fingerprints off - literally had them cut off by a doctor in the Dominican Republic, where's he's from,\" Leonard said. \"This guy was wanted on seven counts of homicide in Texas and Arizona. And we caught him because of his eyes, not because he told the truth, not because his fingerprints worked. It's a perfect reason why fingerprints can't be depended upon, you're not going to cut out your eyes.\"\n\nHernandez, the UCLA professor, contended that these grizzly tales of violence are cherry-picked to paint unauthorized immigrants with a broad criminal brush. The narrative may work to sell surveillance expansion, she argued, but also bolsters unfounded racial hatred against immigrant communities.\n\n\"The argument that there are extraordinarily violent individuals living within these populations has always been a part of immigrant exclusion projects,\" Hernandez said. \"Especially for Mexican-Americans, there was a clear shift in the middle of the 1950s, after Operation Wetback\" - a 1950s crackdown on immigration rife with civil rights violations - \"which was supposed to have solved the problem of immigration but didn't actually stop it. So to rationalize the ongoing immigration, authorities explicitly no longer spoke about immigrants as workers, but as criminals. We've been stuck with that discourse ever since.\"\n\nBI2's iris surveillance expansion on the border is moving ahead full steam despite these concerns. According to Leonard, the El Paso County sheriff's department now has iris identification up and running, and Cameron County is next. Leonard says these installations will help authorities finally gain \"control\" of the border by documenting the undocumented.\n\n\"Right now, there is nothing like this on the border because the federal government has never given law enforcement agencies the technology to differentiate anybody in the field for any reason,\" Leonard said. \"That's why we have so many illegal aliens: They just get in, and we don't know who the hell they are and who they're not.\"\n\nHernandez, however, predicts that BI2's iris solution will fail to stop migration flows, just as every law enforcement strategy before it failed. \"This is just another example of profit making in immigration control, which seems to be on the rise with this administration,\" Hernandez said. \"We have always seen different waves of investment in technology, but they never have an impact on immigration. Yet we remain eternally convinced this stuff will save us from the larger problems of the border.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

Will This Election Be Different?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn most states, people convicted of a felony can't vote. People awaiting trial in jail can, but they face huge barriers to access.\n\nYonas Kahsai spent much of high school encouraging members of his Phoenix, Arizona, community to get out and vote. The child of a Somali refugee turned union organizer, he'd worked with a group that registered over 150,000 mostly Latino voters ahead of the 2016 Maricopa County race that unseated controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio after over two decades in office. When he turned 18, he eagerly registered to vote himself.\n\nBut by the time the next election rolled around, Kahsai was in jail.\n\nIn most states, people who are convicted of a felony cannot vote - but people who are in jail awaiting trial and have no prior felony conviction can. Kahsai knew his rights, so he requested a ballot from inside his cell. At first, a guard told him that he couldn't have one. Kahsai pushed back and was eventually granted a request to temporarily change his address to the facility and get an absentee ballot.\n\nThe ballot never came. The election passed, Kahsai was found guilty, and he lost his ability to vote forever.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nMany people don't know it's possible to vote from jail. But in 1974, the Supreme Court affirmed that eligible voters who are detained have a constitutional right to the ballot. The court, however, left it up to states and local jurisdictions to decide how they wanted to ensure pretrial detainee voter access in their jails.\n\nThat access widely varies by state and even more so by county. Oftentimes neither jail staff nor inmates are aware of detainee voting rights. Restrictions on mail can make receiving ballots impossible, and a lack of access to the internet and fear of unknowingly breaking the law can dissuade inmates from requesting a ballot in the first place. When they do, corrections officers may deny it. The result is de facto disenfranchisement for people incarcerated in jails.\n\nTake Arizona, a historically conservative but rapidly changing state, which will hold its Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday. Jail voting there is scant, despite the state's anticipated importance as a potential swing state in the general election.\n\nIn the 2018 midterm elections, only eight people in Arizona voted from jail, according to data obtained by public records requests made out to each county and shared with The Intercept by the organization Campaign Legal Center, which works on ballot access issues for incarcerated voters. Kahsai, despite his attempts, was not one of them - he later found out that his ballot never arrived because it was too large for the Maricopa jail's mail size limits.\n\nThis election cycle, a coalition of public defenders, voting advocates, and formerly incarcerated people sought to change the situation in Arizona, starting with its largest county, Maricopa. Through partnerships with voting officials and the local sheriff, the plan was to end voter disenfranchisement in Maricopa jails by the Democratic primary on March 17. They hoped to establish a model that they could bring to every county in the state in time for the general presidential election in November.\n\nBut as Tuesday's primary approaches, no one is sure what the county has done to support jail voting and ensure that eligible voters are aware of their rights.\n\nA decade before Kahsai entered Arizona's jail system, Joe Watson found himself inside Lower Buckeye Jail in Maricopa County. He'd robbed a series of convenience stores to satisfy a worsening gambling addiction.\n\nIt was 2008, and Watson, a longtime local journalist, was excited about the upcoming presidential election - the young Democratic senator from Illinois piqued his interest.\n\nBut when he requested an absentee voter registration form from each passing correctional officer, he said they merely laughed.\n\n\"They just ignored me. There was nothing I could do,\" said Watson, who now works as a researcher and consultant at the American Friends Service Committee - Arizona. \"I was just denied my right to vote. It was very deflating. There's a culture inside of guards telling you that you don't matter, and this - this was them proving it. And that's the end of it, because less than two years later, I had been convicted and sentenced, and I have not had the right to vote since.\"\n\nArizona currently holds an estimated 14,000 people in its jails, according to the Department of Justice's National Institute of Corrections . It's hard to know exactly how many of these individuals are eligible voters; the sheriffs' offices that oversee county jails rarely track this information.\n\nBut Alex Gulotta, Arizona director of All Voting Is Local, an organization that works to increase voting access in several key election states, said the group currently estimates that about 60 percent of people in Arizona jails are preconviction and eligible voters.\n\nAs with other forms of disenfranchisement, access to voting in jails plays out along lines of race and class. Those who can afford bail are less likely to be incarcerated while awaiting trial, and people of color, particularly black and Native people, are disproportionately represented in Arizona's jail population.\n\n\"These are exactly the kinds of voters that our system has excluded through the course of American history. In Arizona and across the country, the vast majority of people in jails are there because they cannot afford to pay bail,\" said Dana Paikowsky, a legal fellow at Campaign Legal Center. \"Which means that in the case of voting, your bail functions like a poll tax: The only thing preventing you from accessing the ballot is an inability to pay.\"\n\nMany Arizona county sheriffs' offices told The Intercept that they would provide absentee ballots to detainees who requested them.\n\n\"But the thing is, we know they don't always,\" said Adrienne Carmack, advocacy director of Arizona Advocacy Network and Foundation, an organization that works to expand voter access in the state, referring to Kahsai's case.\n\nYonas Kahsai, center right, and Belen Sisa, center left, at the \"Arizona United Against Trump\" event in Phoenix on Nov. 12, 2016. Over 500 attendees protested at the Arizona state capitol.\n\nKahsai, who was awaiting trial for robbing multiple Circle K convenience stores, was known to local voter advocates because of his organizing work. Hearing about his difficulty voting in 2018, they got together and pressured city officials to make sure that he received a ballot for last year's special runoff election for the mayor of Phoenix.\n\nThis is how jail voting works in many states: When it happens, it's often because of committed individuals, either from advocacy groups or within local sheriff's or county registrars' offices.\n\nKahsai said he still felt ecstatic.\n\n\"Because I knew that would likely be my first, and probably last, chance to vote for a really long time,'\" Kahsai said in an interview with The Intercept inside Lewis prison, where he is currently incarcerated. \"I got to use my voice and opinion while I was locked up. You know how empowered that makes you feel, when everything around you tells you that you're not in control of the situation?\"\n\nKahsai was convicted of a felony sentence two months later and lost his right to the ballot.\n\nOther jurisdictions, like Illinois and Washington, D.C. , have made an effort to reach people like Kahsai and seen their voter turnout increase.\n\n\"Once opportunities are available, people take advantage of them,\" Paikowsky said. \"When you invest resources into the jail - and these resources don't have to be significant - you see that more people vote.\"\n\nThe Intercept contacted the sheriffs' offices in all 15 Arizona counties about their plans for Election Day. Of the eight that responded, only two, Gila and Yuma, had something of a plan for ensuring detainees were aware of their right to vote. The counties will put up educational posters and flyers and facilitate voting for people who enter the jail 11 days or less before the election - the deadline to request an absentee ballot in Arizona. Two other counties tell detainees about their right to vote during the intake process.\n\nIt's this patchwork that motivated the coalition to form in 2018. They resolved to start with Maricopa County, the fourth-largest county in the nation and where all eight of the people who voted during the 2018 midterms hailed from.\n\nLast August, the coalition began meeting regularly with the county recorder's office, who in turn said it was communicating with the sheriff's office to develop a system before Arizona's primary the following March.\n\nBy November, the coalition had drafted a three-page policy of procedures to ensure the rights of incarcerated voters. The plan, approved by the Maricopa County Recorder's Office and reviewed by The Intercept, provides a process for every aspect of in-jail voting - from voter registration, to educating inmates about their right to vote, to the casting and receiving of ballots by mail.\n\nIt would resolve the issue of mail-in ballots not arriving, as in Kahsai's case, by having Maricopa jails count all official election-related mail as \"legal mail.\" It also included a provision for a special election board to facilitate the voting process for people who enter the jail system after the absentee ballot cutoff.\n\n\"Our goal is to have the procedures in place in Maricopa County, to pilot it, by the presidential primary election,\" Carmack told The Intercept in January. \"And by November, we want to have all the counties have a procedure.\"\n\nWith the approval of the proposal by the recorder's office, all that remained was for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, now led by Democratic Sheriff Paul Penzone, to implement the policies in the jails: to hang posters and make announcements alerting voters of upcoming elections and their rights, begin facilitating monthly voter registration and absentee voting education visits from the recorder's office, and in the 11 days before the election, inform voters of their right to a special election board.\n\nBut the coalition said its December meeting with the sheriff's office to check in on its progress was rescheduled. And rescheduled again in January. Finally, in February, the group had a meeting with Tommy McKone, director of government and external affairs for the sheriff's office.\n\nMcKone told the coalition that it would not be possible for the sheriff's office to turn this around \"on such short notice,\" Gulotta recalled. That made no sense to him, after three months of meetings with the recorder's office, which was supposedly in talks with the sheriff. \"They acted like it was the first time that they had ever seen them. Or heard of them,\" he said.\n\nKathren Coleman, deputy recorder for communications for the Maricopa County Recorder's Office, maintained that her office communicated with the sheriff's office throughout the process. \"The Recorder's Office has worked with detainee-voting advocates, the formerly detained, and public defenders through a coalition-style group to determine the resources needed to provide a program serving jail voters,\" Coleman added.\n\nThe Maricopa County Sheriff's Office declined to comment on the meeting with the coalition or on the proposed reforms to the jail voting process. Penzone declined requests for an interview.\n\n\"I know this is very general, but this is something that MCSO has done for many years and continues to do, which is make ballots available to all inmates who request to vote,\" said Norma Gutierrez-Deorta, the office's director of public information, in an emailed statement. \"All inmates are granted the opportunity to practice their constitutional right to vote. We will continue to comply with all requirements of Arizona's election laws.\"\n\nAs elected officials, sheriffs are tasked with facilitating voting for the jail population in their care, even during election cycles when their own name may be on the ballot.\n\nPenzone will be on the ballot in November, running against Arpaio; so will Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes, who is also a Democrat.\n\n\"The thing they have to be careful of,\" said Paul Bentz, longtime political pollster in the state and senior vice president of research and strategy at HighGround, \"is being attacked for wanting to get these individuals the right to vote so they can vote for them. The county still leans Republican right now. The demographics are changing some, but I think this'll be a high turnout election. That's the other thing Penzone is being very mindful of - he has to make sure he's doing things that appeal to that Republican base. This doesn't seem like one of them.\"\n\n\"I'm sure that's part of the reason why the sheriff's office doesn't seem to be at least engaging on it at this point,\" he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, the coalition - and jail voters - will be back to where they were before: practicing ad hoc advocacy to help eligible voters who try to cast their ballot in the primary. They don't know how successful that will be, or if people who got to jail in the last 11 days will be allowed to vote at all. The county is mailing ballots to all registered Democratic voters in light of the coronavirus threat, but those ballots likely won't reach people who have just entered the system. A global pandemic might not have been on county officials' minds a few months ago, but jail voting should have been, coalition members noted.\n\n\"It's frustrating to have initiated a conversation of that far ahead of the election, and to be here in March of 2020 and still not have accomplished anything meaningful,\" said Gulotta. \"The number of meetings we had, the number of people who were at the table ... the fact that they haven't actually done anything with that seems to be a huge waste.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "California Sheriffs Use Bare-Knuckle Tactics Against \"Sanctuary State\" Proposal\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are allying with ICE and anti-immigration activists to lobby against a bill that would make California a \"sanctuary state.\"\n\nPart 2\n\nEarlier this year, Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones invited Immigrations and Custom Enforcement chief Thomas Homan to a community forum. The event was advertised to the public as an opportunity to clear up misinformation around the immigration debate.\n\nIn private, however, Jones confided over email to Homan and other ICE officials that he wanted to use the event help to derail Senate Bill 54, legislation proposed to create so-called \"sanctuary state\" protections in California.\n\nIn a follow-up email confirming the forum, Jones wrote to Timothy Robbins, the Los Angeles enforcement director for ICE: \"I can't thank you and the director enough for agreeing to do this. I'm sure there are more comfortable ways to spend a Tuesday evening, but I do believe this will turn the tide of SB54.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's assault on so-called sanctuary cities - municipalities that, to varying degrees, refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities - has included threats to cut off federal funding streams. Among these grant programs are several that give financial support to local law enforcement agencies. While it's not clear what effect cutting these programs would have on public safety, they have become a flashpoint in the debate over local and, in the case of California, statewide efforts to create sanctuaries for immigrants who are in the country without legal authorization.\n\nThe Trump administration has a relatively small political foothold in California; Democrats control all statewide elected offices and hold a supermajority in the state legislature. Yet the California State Sheriffs' Association has spearheaded the effort to defeat SB 54.\n\nAll but one of California's elected county sheriffs have mounted a robust lobbying effort, deploying considerable advocacy resources along with a media campaign closely coordinated with the Trump administration. The sheriffs' bare-knuckle advocacy efforts are detailed in emails obtained by The Intercept through California Public Records Act requests.\n\nThe current head of the CSSA, William Brown, who also serves as the sheriff of Santa Barbara County, has taken a lead role in public as the voice of opposition to SB 54.\n\nIn an attempt to assuage concerns, legislators added amendments to the bill that allowed law enforcement agencies to refer those immigrants who are in the country illegally and also convicted of serious and violent felonies to immigration officials. But Brown was unmoved: He declared during an Assembly hearing earlier this year that, despite the amendments, the legislation still \"provides sanctuary for criminals.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, Brown has moved aggressively to court opposition to SB 54.\n\nEmails show that should the bill pass, law enforcement may ally with far-right forces to place a ballot initiative to roll back the protections. In February, Brown corresponded about such an initiative with Ted Hilton, an anti-immigration activist who has claimed in the past that giving unauthorized immigrants a legal path to citizenship would make the U.S. like a \"Third World country.\" Draft language of the ballot initiative would give ICE wide latitude in processing any undocumented individual arrested by local police.\n\n\"This is the best political climate to move forward on this type of measure with advocacy from the Trump administration,\" Hilton said. His email was forwarded to Brown by an assistant, who confirmed over email that the two would hold an in-person meeting. Hilton also claimed that he had secured assurance from Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., that the campaign to push a ballot initiative forward could make use of the congressman's voter lists.\n\nIn addition to corresponding with anti-immigration activists, Brown coordinated closely with ICE to make the case against SB 54. In April, Brown expressed frustration in an email to an ICE official, noting that the agency could have done more to assist with his campaign against sanctuary policies. He noted that he had previously requested information on the \"primary charges of previous inmates who were released to ICE in 2016.\"\n\nThe California sheriffs lobbying against SB 54 have centered their campaign on claims that the bill will force the release of violent criminals. That information, Brown wrote to an ICE official, could have been \"very valuable, and I suspect would have reflected very beneficially on ICE, in my numerous recent meetings with legislators, advocacy groups, and the media re: SB 54 and immigration issues generally.\"\n\nAlong with other sheriffs, Brown raised the issue of the loss of federal funding, a threat that the Trump administration has made to any jurisdiction with sanctuary policies. In a letter to Assemblymember Monique Limón, whom political observers see as a swing Democrat on a variety of contentious issues, he stressed the danger of losing \"vital federal funding\" with passage of the bill.\n\nSacramento lobbying firm Warner, Pank, Salzillo & Sanchez, which helped the sheriffs mobilize for news conferences and approaching legislators, also maintains a close watch on the tactics of their opposition.\n\nA note from John Robertson, the Napa County sheriff, alerted fellow sheriffs that the American Civil Liberties Union could be setting traps around SB 54. The message, shared by Cory Salzillo, a Warner lobbyist for the CSSA, suggested that the ACLU was using invitations to forums about the bill as a way to ambush sheriffs with hostile media.\n\n\"If this is a tactic that the ACLU is going to be using to promote their immigration agenda,\" Robertson wrote, \"I just thought you should be aware.\"\n\nThe lobbying firm regularly forwards opportunities to work closely with the California Republican Party to undermine sanctuary protections. In February, Salzillo discussed the potential downsides of openly associating with Senate Republicans so early in the legislative process, as the state GOP was \"ratcheting up their opposition to SB 54.\" Donny Youngblood, the Kern County sheriff, agreed with limited public association, but noted , \"Sheriff's [sic] like me would be happy to stand with the Republicans.\"\n\nThe lobby firm corresponded with the office of Republican Assemblymember Travis Allen on its sanctuary strategy. Allen, notably, is running for governor, and has cited opposition to sanctuary policies as a major issue in his campaign.\n\nOrange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens speaks during a news conference at Orange County Sheriff's Department headquarters in Santa Ana, Calif. on Wednesday, June 28, 2017.\n\nThe sheriffs have also taken to conservative media to broadcast their message, appearing on talk radio and cable news to warn that SB 54 will lead to undocumented immigrants terrorizing communities.\n\nIn July, Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens appeared on Fox News's \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" to declare that the bill \"places Californians at risk of being impacted by these criminals who are getting released to the street.\"\n\nDuring her appearance, Hutchens and Carlson went through the usual litany of points against the bill, raising the specter of dangerous immigrants released from local jails and noting that if sheriffs can't cooperate with ICE, immigration officials would raid local communities, potentially exacerbating tensions.\n\nBut Carlson raised an additional point: \"If the state of California can say to the feds, 'We are just ignoring your law,' then why can't Orange County say to the state of California, 'We are ignoring your law?'\"\n\nHutchens gave an eyebrow-raising response: Her office had already asked that question, she said, and they've reached out to their attorney to see if Orange County can simply violate state law. But, she added, \"We would be subject to being prosecuted if we didn't follow state law.\"\n\nThe political dynamics appear to favor proponents of the sanctuary state bill; it has robust backing from nearly every high-profile Democrat in the state, buoyed by growing interest in opposing Trump's deportation agenda.\n\nBut the California sheriffs have a long history of political victories. Last year, they successfully lobbied to defeat a state ballot initiative, Prop 62, to end the death penalty, while helping to pass a dueling initiative, Prop 66, that sped up the death penalty process. It was a stunning victory for law enforcement, despite being vastly outspent by death penalty opponents.\n\nFor the sanctuary state proposal, however, not all California sheriffs are completely united in the campaign. Jim Hart of Santa Cruz County is the only sheriff in the state to buck the sheriffs' association and support SB 54. In a May 10 position letter sent to Senate Speaker Kevin de León, Hart wrote that \"public safety is not enhanced when local law enforcement officers enforce immigration laws or act in a manner that causes suspicion within the diverse communities we serve.\"\n\nTop photo: A sheriff's deputy (R) talks to an immigration detainee (L) in a high-security housing unit at the Theo Lacy Facility, a county jail which also houses immigration detainees arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Orange, California, on March 14, 2017.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Pipeline Company Spent Big on Police Gear to Use Against Standing Rock Protesters\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTigerSwan worked with law enforcement to fight an information war against the Indigenous-led water protectors.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nPart 19\n\nTheir protest encampment razed, the Indigenous-led environmental movement at North Dakota's Standing Rock reservation was searching for a new tactic. By March 2017, the fight over the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline had been underway for months. Leaders of the movement to defend Indigenous rights on the land - and its waterways - had a new aim: to march on Washington.\n\nNative leaders and activists, calling themselves water protectors, wanted to show the newly elected President Donald Trump that they would continue to fight for their treaty rights to lands including the pipeline route. The march would be called \"Native Nations Rise.\"\n\nLaw enforcement was getting ready too - and discussing plans with Energy Transfer, the parent company of the Dakota Access pipeline. Throughout much of the uprising against the pipeline, the National Sheriffs' Association talked routinely with TigerSwan, Energy Transfer's lead security firm on the project, working hand in hand to craft pro-pipeline messaging. A top official with the sheriffs' PR contractor, Off the Record Strategies, floated a plan to TigerSwan's lead propagandist, a man named Robert Rice.\n\nAn email from Off the Record Strategies, working for the National Sheriffs' Association to plan information operations to influence the narrative around the Dakota Access pipeline.\n\n\"Thoughts on a crew or a news reporter - or someone pretending to be - with a camera and microphone to report from the main rally on the Friday, ask questions about pipeline and slice together [sic]?\" Off the Record CEO Mark Pfeifle suggested over email .\n\nA security firm led by a former member of the U.S. military's shadowy Special Forces, TigerSwan was no stranger to such deception. The company had, in fact, used fake reporters before - including Rice himself - to spread its message and to spy on pipeline opponents . The National Sheriffs' Association's involvement in advocating for a similar disinformation campaign against the anti-pipeline movement has not been previously reported.\n\nThe email from the National Sheriffs' Association PR shop was among the more than 55,000 internal TigerSwan documents obtained by The Intercept and Grist through a public records request. The documents, released by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board, reveal how TigerSwan and the sheriffs' group worked together to twist the story in the media so that it aligned with the oil company's interests, seeking to pollute the public's perception of the water protectors.\n\nThe documents also outline details of previously unreported collaborations on the ground between TigerSwan and police forces. During the uprising at Standing Rock, TigerSwan provided law enforcement support with helicopter flights, medics, and security guards. The private security firm pushed for the purchase, by Energy Transfer, of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of radios for the cops. TigerSwan also placed an order for a catalog of so-called less-lethal weapons for police use, including tear gas. The security contractor even planned to facilitate an exchange where Energy Transfer and police could share purported evidence of illegal activity .\n\nMeanwhile, communications firms working for Energy Transfer and the National Sheriffs' Association worked together to write newsletters , plant pro-pipeline articles in the media, and circulate \"wanted\"-style posters of particular protesters, the documents show. And the heads of both the National Sheriffs' Association and TigerSwan engaged in discussions on strategy to counter the anti-pipeline movement, with propaganda becoming a priority for both the police and private security.\n\n\"It is extremely dangerous to have private interests dictating and coloring the flow of administrative justice,\" said Chase Iron Eyes, director of the media organization Last Real Indians and a member of the Oceti Sakowin people. Iron Eyes was active at Standing Rock and mentioned in TigerSwan's files. \"We learned at Standing Rock, law and order serves capital and property.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, whose jurisdiction in Morton County, North Dakota, abuts the Standing Rock reservation, said collaboration with pipeline security was limited. \"We had a cooperation with them in reference to the pipeline workers' safety while conducting their business,\" he said in an email. \"TigerSwan was not to be involved in any law enforcement detail.\" (TigerSwan, Energy Transfer, and the National Sheriffs' Association did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nRice, the TigerSwan propagandist, had posed as a news anchor for anti-protester segments posted on a Facebook page he created to sway the local community against the Standing Rock protests. But when Pfeifle, the sheriff group's PR man, suggested pretending to be a reporter at the Native Nations Rise protest, Rice was unavailable. (Off the Record did not respond to a request for comment.) Pfeifle found another way to tell the pipeline and police's story: a far-right news website founded by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Pfeifle wrote to Rice : \"We did get Daily Caller to cover event yesterday.\"\n\nProtesters shield their faces as a line of law enforcement officers holding large canisters with pepper spray shout orders to move back, in Morton County, N.D., on Oct. 27, 2016.\n\nThe idea of working with police was baked into Energy Transfer's arrangement with TigerSwan. The firm's contract for the Dakota Access pipeline specifically assigned TigerSwan to \"take the lead with various law enforcement agencies per state, county, state National Guard and the federal interagency if required.\"\n\nCooperation between Energy Transfer's security operation and law enforcement agencies, however, began even before TigerSwan arrived on the scene. A PowerPoint presentation from Silverton, another contractor hired by Energy Transfer, described its relationship with law enforcement as a \"public private partnership.\" The September 2016 presentation said that a private intelligence cell was \"coordinating with LE\" - law enforcement - \"and helping develop Person of Interest packets specifically designed to aid in LE prosecution.\"\n\nMultiple documents make clear that part of the purpose of Energy Transfer's intelligence collection was to support law enforcement prosecutions. A September 2016 document describing TigerSwan's early priorities said, \"Continue to collect information of an evidentiary level in order to further the DAPL Security effort and assist Law Enforcement with information to aid in prosecution.\"\n\nThe collaboration extended to materiel. TigerSwan operatives realized soon after they arrived that local law enforcement officials lacked encrypted radios and could not communicate with state or municipal law enforcement agencies - or with Dakota Access pipeline security, according to emails. Energy Transfer purchased 100 radios, for $391,347, with plans to lease a number of them to law enforcement officers.\n\n\"We want them to go to LEO as a gift which represents DAPL's concern for public safety,\" wrote Tom Siguaw, a senior director at Energy Transfer, in an email.\n\nDuring large protest events, TigerSwan and police worked together to keep water protectors from interfering with construction. On one day in late October 2016, the day of the protests' largest mass arrest, Energy Transfer's security personnel \"held law enforcement's east flank\" and supported sheriffs' deputies and National Guard members with seven medical personnel and two helicopters, named Valkyrie and Saber.\n\nAfter the incident, TigerSwan planned to set up a shared drive , where law enforcement officials could upload crime reports and charging documents, and TigerSwan could share photographs and pipeline opponents' social media. Documents show other instances in which TigerSwan set up online exchanges with law enforcement. In a February 2017 PowerPoint presentation , TigerSwan described plans to use another shared drive to post security personnel's videos and photographs, taken both aerially and on the ground during a different mass arrest.\n\nA diagram from TigerSwan showing the uses of a drive for law enforcement and Energy Transfer's security operations to share purported evidence of illegal activity.\n\nA Dakota Access Pipeline helicopter also supported law enforcement officials during one of the most notorious nights of the crackdown, in November 2016, when police unleashed water hoses on water protectors in below-freezing temperatures. By morning, police were in danger of running out of less-lethal weapons - which can still be deadly but are designed to incapacitate their targets. TigerSwan and Energy Transfer again stepped in.\n\nTigerSwan founder James Reese, a former commander in the elite Army Special Operations unit Delta Force, reached out to a contact at the North Carolina State Highway Patrol. North Carolina had recently used TigerSwan's GuardianAngel mapping tool to respond to uprisings in Charlotte, in the aftermath of the 2016 police killing of Keith Scott . (A spokesperson from the North Carolina Department of Public Safety said the agency does not currently have a relationship with TigerSwan.)\n\nReese sent a list of weaponry sought by North Dakota law enforcement to an officer from the Highway Patrol. The list included tear gas, pepper spray, bean bag rounds, and foam rounds. The official referred Reese to a contact at Safariland, which manufactures the gear.\n\n\"We will purchase the items, and gift them to LE,\" Reese told the Safariland representative. \"We need a nation wide push if you can help?\"\n\nMeanwhile, another TigerSwan team member sent the Minnesota-based police supply store Streicher's an even longer list of less-lethal weapons and ammunition. \"Please confirm availability of the following price and ship immediately with overnight delivery,\" TigerSwan's Phil Rehak wrote .\n\nRehak told The Intercept and Grist that his job was to procure equipment - including for law enforcement. \"I would be given an order by either somebody from TigerSwan or maybe even law enforcement, being like, 'Hey, can you find these supplies?'\" He said he doesn't know if the less-lethal weaponry was ultimately delivered to the sheriffs.\n\n\"I am not aware of any radios for Morton County or any less lethal weapons from Tiger Swan,\" Kirchmeier, the Morton County sheriff, told The Intercept and Grist in an email. \"I dealt with ND DES for resources.\" (Two other sheriffs involved with the multiagency law enforcement response did not answer requests for comment. Eric Jensen, a spokesperson for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services, said the agency had no arrangement with TigerSwan or Energy Transfer to provide less-lethal weapons, and that they wouldn't have knowledge of any arrangements between law enforcement and the companies.)\n\nThe \"partnership\" went both ways, with TigerSwan sometimes viewing law enforcement weapons as potential assets. In mid-October 2016, as senior Energy Transfer personnel prepared to join state officials for a government archeological survey to examine the pipeline route, three law enforcement \"snipers\" agreed to be on standby with an air team, according to a memo by another security company, RGT, that was working under TigerSwan's management. A Predator drone was listed among \"friendly assets\" in the memo.\n\nTigerSwan routinely shared what it learned about the protest movement with local police, but most of what the documents describe in the way of reciprocal sharing - from law enforcement to TigerSwan - came from the National Sheriffs' Association.\n\nIn March 2017, the sheriffs' group helped the South Dakota Legislature pass a law to prevent future Standing Rock-style pipeline uprisings, the documents say. To support the effort, the Morton County Sheriff's Office sent along a \"law enforcement sensitive\" state operational update from the North Dakota State and Local Intelligence Center. National Sheriffs' Association head Jonathan Thompson forwarded the document to TigerSwan executive Shawn Sweeney. Thompson recommended Sweeney look at the last page, which included a list of anti-pipeline camps across the U.S.\n\nTigerSwan also recruited at least one law enforcement officer with whom it worked on the ground. In November 2016, Reese requested a phone call with Maj. Chad McGinty of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, who had acted as commander of a team from Ohio sent to assist police in North Dakota. By February 1, McGinty, who declined to comment for this story, was working for TigerSwan as a law enforcement liaison, earning more than $440 a day.\n\nA protester is treated after being pepper sprayed by private security contractors on land being graded for the Dakota Access pipeline, near Cannon Ball, N.D., on Sept. 3, 2016.\n\nTigerSwan's contract also mandated that the firm help Energy Transfer with telling its story. The firm was expected \"to help turn the page on the story that we are being overwhelmed with over the past few weeks,\" according to a document from mid-September 2016.\n\nEnergy Transfer's image was in trouble early on. Critical media coverage of Standing Rock grew dramatically in early September after private security guards hired by the company unleashed guard dogs on protesters. A flood of reporters arrived on the ground to cover the protests. Social media posts routinely went viral. The narrative that took hold portrayed the pipeline company as instigating violence against peaceful protesters.\n\nEnergy Transfer recruited third parties to spread its messaging and counter the unfavorable storyline. At least two additional contractors - DCI and MarketLeverage - joined TigerSwan in trying to burnish Energy Transfer's image. TigerSwan recruited retired Maj. Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks, who led intelligence efforts for the Army during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and served on TigerSwan's advisory board, to write favorable op-eds and deliver commentary. (Marks did not respond to a request for comment.) With its veneer of law enforcement authority, the National Sheriffs' Association would become Energy Transfer's most powerful third-party voice.\n\nTogether, TigerSwan, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the public relations contractors formed a powerful public relations machine, monitoring social media closely, convincing outside groups to promote pro-pipeline messaging, and planting stories.\n\nOff the Record Strategies, the public relations firm working for the National Sheriffs' Association, coordinated with the opposition research firm Delve to track activists' social media pages, arrest records, and funding sources. The companies sought to paint the protesters as violent, professional, billionaire-funded , out-of-state agitators whose camps represented the true ecological disaster , as well as to identify movement infighting that might be exploited. Both companies were led by Bush administration alumni. (Delve did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nFraming water protectors as criminals was a key National Sheriffs' Association strategy. \"Let's start drumbeat of the worst of the worst this week?\" Pfeifle, Off the Record's CEO, suggested to the head of the sheriffs' group in one email. \"One or two a day? Move them out through social media...The out of state wife beaters, child abusers and thieves first... Mugshot, ND arrest date, rap sheet and other data wrapped in and easy to share?\"\n\nThe result was \"wanted\"-style posters - called \"Professional Protestors with Dangerous Criminal Histories\" - featuring pipeline opponents' photos and criminal records, which Pfeifle's team circulated online and routinely shared with TigerSwan. The National Sheriffs' Association repeatedly asked TigerSwan to help \"move\" its criminal record research on social media, and TigerSwan repurposed the sheriffs' group arrest research for its own propaganda products.\n\nPfeifle also made summary statistics of protesters' arrest records and a map of where they were from. The color-coded map came with a running tally of the number of protesters. The details collected by Pfeifle then began showing up in blogs and remarks by police to reporters. One piece by KXMB-TV , a television station in Bismarck, North Dakota, repeated almost verbatim statistics summarizing the number of protesters arrested and their criminal histories, noting that \"just 8 percent are from North Dakota.\"\n\nNaomi Oreskes, a science historian who has researched the fossil fuel industry's communications strategies , said the attempt to frame environmental defenders as criminals was consistent with the long trend of attempts to discredit activists. However, it was also \"particularly noxious,\" she said, because the energy industry has pushed for stronger penalties against trespass and other anti-protest laws. \"They make it harder for people to engage in peaceful protest,\" said Oreskes. \"People are arrested and they say, 'See, those people are criminals.'\"\n\nDCI, which got its start \" doing the dirty work of the tobacco industry \" and helped found the tea party movement, was also a key player influencing media coverage, placing and distributing op-eds. In one exchange between DCI partner Megan Bloomgren, who would later become a top Trump administration official, and Reese, Bloomgren sent a list of 14 articles \"we've placed that we've been pushing over social media.\" The articles ranged from opinion pieces in support of the pipeline in local newspapers to posts on right-wing blogs.\n\nOreskes said using opinion articles in this way is a common strategy pioneered by the tobacco industry, among others. \"You push that out into social media to make it seem as if there's broad grassroots support for the pipeline,\" said Oreskes. \"The reader doesn't know that this is part of a coordinated strategy by the industry.\"\n\nMarketLeverage, another Energy Transfer contractor, also spent a considerable amount of its resources tracking social media and boosting pro-pipeline messages. In the weeks following the dog attacks, for instance, Shane Hackett, a top official with MarketLeverage, suggested highlighting a Facebook post by Archie Fool Bear, a Standing Rock tribal member who was critical of the NoDAPL movement. \"We need to exploit that shit immediately while we have a chance,\" a TigerSwan operative wrote in response to an email from their colleague Rice, the chief propagandist. (Neither DCI nor Market Leverage responded to requests for comment.)\n\nHackett suggested creating a graphic out of the tribal member's post and having \"other accounts share his post with the same hashtags.\" Rice provided the social media text and hashtags, including, \"Respected Tribe Members Call Attention to Standing Rock Leadership Lies and Failures #TribeLiesMatter #NoDAPL #SiouxTruth.\" Obscure social media accounts then repeated the exact language.\n\n\"These people who are trained to use whatever publicity they can for their advantage, they're going to do what they want anyway,\" Fool Bear told The Intercept and Grist. \"They don't live in my shoes, and they don't believe in what my beliefs are. If they're going to take what I say and manipulate it, I can't stop them.\"\n\nProtesters confront police guarding a bridge near Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation on Nov. 30, 2016, outside Cannon Ball, N.D.\n\nOff the Record Strategies and the National Sheriffs' Association didn't just focus on issues of law-breaking. The association parroted some of the same messages that TigerSwan - as well as climate change deniers in Congress - were trafficking. Notable among them was a right-wing conspiracy theory that the environmental movement was \" directed and controlled \" by a club of billionaires.\n\nThe National Sheriffs' Association also tried to undermine the credibility of well-known advocates Bill McKibben and Jane Kleeb, who founded the environmental organizations 350.org and Bold Alliance, respectively. Pfeifle circulated memos on the two movement leaders. \"McKibben is a radical liberal determined to 'bankrupt' energy producers,\" said one , adding, \"McKibben will join any protest because he enjoys the fanfare.\" Another memo said, \"Kleeb admitted her pipeline opposition was about political organization and opportunity, not the environment.\"\n\nKleeb and McKibben expressed bemusement at TigerSwan and the sheriffs' association's fixation on their work. \"It's all pretty creepy,\" McKibben, a former Grist board member, said in an email. \"I live in a county with a sheriff, and it seems okay if he tracks the speed of my car down Rte 116, but tracking every word I write seems like... not his job.\"\n\nThe sheriffs' group also listed the nonprofit organizations Center for Biological Diversity, Rainforest Action Network, and Food & Water Watch as \" Extremist Environmental Groups \" - a pejorative used by some authoritarian government officials, including from the Trump administration.\n\n\"Campaigning against corporations driving our climate crisis and human rights violations is not extremist,\" said Rainforest Action Network Executive Director Ginger Cassady. Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the association's flyer contained \"categorically false\" information about the organization - a sentiment repeated by others mentioned throughout TigerSwan's other records.\n\n\"We would urge the Sheriffs' Association to focus on its own responsibilities instead of attempting to undermine well-meaning organizations like ours,\" added Wenonah Hauter, Food & Water Watch's executive director.\n\nBoth the National Sheriffs' Association and TigerSwan took pride in meddling in tribal affairs. Reese enthusiastically encouraged his personnel to spread a story that the Prairie Knights Casino, run by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, was discharging sewage into the Missouri River watershed. Meanwhile, the sheriffs' association worked with TigerSwan to push a story about a drop in revenue at the casino. In an email to TigerSwan's Rice, Pfeifle noted that the issue had been raised at a recent Standing Rock tribal council meeting.\n\n\"We moved this story on front page of Sunday Bismarck Tribune and in SAB blog Friday, playing perfectly into the 'get-out' narrative going into next week,\" Pfeifle wrote to Rice a few days later, referring to the conservative Say Anything Blog. \"Please help echo and amplify, if possible.\"\n\nUsing newsletters and news-like web sites to discredit pipeline opponents' concerns as \" fake news \" was a top tactic for both TigerSwan and the National Sheriffs' Association. The irony of the strategy was not lost on its protagonists.\n\nOver WhatsApp , in June 2017, Rice, the propagandist, chatted with Wesley Fricks, TigerSwan's director of external affairs, about a possible response to a Facebook video in which an unnamed reporter described recently published news reports on TigerSwan's tactics. They would post it on one of the astroturf sites Rice created and describe it as \"fake news.\"\n\n\"That will cause a few people's brains to explode,\" Rice wrote in a WhatsApp message. \"fake news calling fake news fake which is calling other news fake?\"\n\nFrick replied, \"One big circle.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Local Cops Said Pipeline Company Had Influence Over Government Appointment\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSheriffs in Minnesota worried about who would oversee an escrow account, funded by pipeline giant Enbridge, to reimburse the costs of policing protests.\n\nPart 12\n\nAs the Canadian oil pipeline company Enbridge awaited its final permits last summer to begin construction on the Line 3 tar sands oil transport project, Minnesota sheriff's offices along the route fretted. With an Anishinaabe-led movement pledging to carry out nonviolent blockades and demonstrations to prevent the pipeline's construction, local police worried they'd be stuck with the costs of policing and wanted Enbridge to pay instead.\n\nAs part of its permit to build Line 3, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, or PUC, created a special Enbridge-funded account that public safety officials could use to pay for policing Enbridge's political opponents. The police were concerned about who state officials would hire to decide which invoices to pay or reject.\n\nLast June, Kanabec County Sheriff Brian Smith wrote an email to other sheriffs along the pipeline route. \"I think we need to let the PUC know that the person selected needs to be someone that we also agree upon,\" Smith wrote. \"Not a member of the PUC, not a state, county or federal employee, but someone that has an understanding of rioting and MFF operations\" - referring to mobile field force operations, or anti-riot policing.\n\nIn response, Enbridge offered reassurances, according to other police on the email chain . \"I had a discussion with Troy Kirby (Enbridge Chief of Security) this morning, and expressed concern over that position and the escrow account,\" Aitkin County Sheriff Daniel Guida replied. \"He indicated they have some influence on the hiring of that positon [sic] and he would be involved to ensure we are taken care of, one way or another.\"\n\nThe exchange between the sheriffs is an example of the public-private collaborations between law enforcement and fossil fuel companies that have raised alarms for civil rights advocates and environmental activists across the U.S. Oil, gas, and pipeline corporations have forged a range of creative strategies for funding the police who respond to their political opponents, from paying elected constables for work as private security to creating an entire police unit dedicated to protecting infrastructure. Other industries have found ways to route money to police, but corporate law enforcement funding related to pipeline projects is among the most pervasive. Civil liberties advocates say the corporate cash raises troubling questions about private influence over the public institution of policing, noting that growing anti-pipeline protest movements have been met by heavy-handed police tactics.\n\nWith opposition to the Line 3 pipeline mounting, public records obtained by The Intercept shed new light on the depths of the cooperation between Enbridge and public safety officials in Minnesota - especially law enforcement agencies along the route. \"They are being incentivized to carry out the goals of a foreign corporation, and they're being taken care of for doing it,\" said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund's Center for Protest Law and Litigation, which is representing Line 3 pipeline opponents. She said the dynamic was on view in the sheriff's description of Enbridge influence over the escrow account hire: \"That communication is defining of the relationship between the Enbridge corporation and law enforcement in Northern Minnesota.\"\n\nGuida, the Aitkin County sheriff, told The Intercept that, at the time of the email, sheriffs were concerned the account liaison appointment was taking too long and believed Kirby, the Enbridge security head, could speed up the process. Asked for comment, Enbridge directed questions about the account to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. In a statement, PUC spokesperson Will Seuffert said, \"Enbridge had no input into the Escrow Account Manager selection.\" The panel that made the appointment included two commission staff members and one from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety who worked \"without any involvement from Enbridge, or any other parties,\" he said.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn February, Richard Hart, a former official at the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office and a former deputy chief of police in Bloomington, Minnesota, was hired for the role. So far, he has approved more than $900,000 in Enbridge funding for law enforcement agencies and other public safety institutions.\n\nFor Indigenous water protectors, the cooperation between law enforcement and pipeline companies is part of a long history of public security forces being leveraged against Native tribes for private gain, going back to the violent westward expansion of the United States. Tania Aubid, an anti-Line 3 organizer and a member of the Rice Lake Band, which is part of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, said, \"It's keeping on with the Indian Wars.\"\n\nChief among the law enforcement officers' concerns about the escrow account, according to emails obtained through public records requests, was a rule in the Line 3 permit limiting how the funds can be used. Sheriff's offices can use the account to pay for any public safety services \"provided in and about the construction site as a direct result of the construction and removal of the pipeline,\" but they cannot use it to pay for equipment, unless it's personal protective gear.\n\nIt was widely understood - and a particular source of frustration - that so-called less-lethal munitions, such as tear gas, would not be reimbursed through the account. \"We do know for absolute certain that munitions will NOT be an allowable expense,\" noted Carlton County Sheriff Kelly Lake in a November 19 email to fellow members of the Northern Lights Task Force, a coalition of law enforcement and public safety officials set up primarily to respond to anti-pipeline demonstrations.\n\n\"So, we can get reimbursed for trafficking but not equipment needed to protect our community's? [sic]\" wrote Cass County Sheriff Tom Burch a few days later, in reply to an email that said Enbridge funds could be used to address an expected increase in human trafficking related to the arrival of hundreds of temporary workers.\n\nWater protectors protest at a construction site for Enbridge's Line 3 oil pipeline near Palisade, Minn., on Jan. 9, 2021.\n\nThe funding gap for less-lethal munitions was important enough that law enforcement officials raised it with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. In early October, Walz set up a phone call with the sheriffs along the Line 3 route. Ahead of the calls, Lake, the Carlton County sheriff, distributed a handful of talking points to the group. Among them was the problem of tear gas funding.\n\n\"One identified resource we know that will aid in response should the protests become violent and out of control is the use of less lethal munitions such as gas,\" the talking points said. \"We have been told by the PUC that this absolutely will not be an allowable expense for reimbursement through the Public Safety Escrow Account. Enbridge has said they would not directly reimburse this expense as they have put funds aside into the Public Safety Escrow Account already to be utilized to reimburse public safety for response.\"\n\nIt continues, \"If counties along the pipeline route face mass crowds of violent protests that are prolonged events, the small resources of munitions that we may have will be very quickly depleted. Without these less lethal options, there is an incredibly increased risk for responders, protestors, and the community as a whole.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe governor apparently offered words of comfort. \"Dave's assessment is that it went very well and he believes that the Governor will figure out the funding piece and the munitions,\" Lake said in an email after the call, referring to Dave Olmstead, a retired Bloomington police commander who serves as Minnesota's special events preparedness coordinator for Line 3, overseeing the public safety response to the project. \"It sounds like his staff was already trying to line up a meeting internally for them to discuss it.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the governor's office did not answer a question about the phone call and directed all queries about state funding to the Department of Public Safety, which did not respond to a request for comment. Guida told The Intercept that his department has received no additional funding from the state to pay for less-lethal weapons.\n\nRegardless of what funding the governor arranged, less-lethal weapons, including tear gas, are baked into law enforcement's plans for Line 3.\n\nA Northern Lights Task Force document laying out the overarching police strategy for Line 3 protests , also obtained through a public information request, repeatedly notes the importance of protecting free speech rights, urging officers to \"make reasonable efforts to employ 'non-arrest' methods of crowd management\" and to target leaders and agitators, rather than detaining people en masse.\n\nIf targeted arrests fail to disperse a group, according to the document, then chemical weapons are allowed, including smoke, pepper spray, or a combination of the two, followed by longer-range pepper spray, pepper blast balls, and tear gas. Impact munitions, firearms-fired projectiles in the less-lethal category like sponge rounds, marking rounds, and pepper spray-tipped rounds can only be targeted at individuals whose actions put others in danger of injury. The use of dogs requires permission from local law enforcement commanders.\n\nGuida justified planning for the use of less-lethal munitions by comparing the Line 3 opposition to the movement against the Dakota Access pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. \"It seemed that without less than lethal munitions, when they lost control, that things would have continued to spiral out of control,\" Guida said.\n\nVerheyden-Hilliard is part of the legal team representing Dakota Access pipeline opponents in a class-action civil rights lawsuit against law enforcement officials in North Dakota, including a woman who lost vision in one eye after police shot her in the face with a tear gas canister. \"If we want to look at what happened with DAPL, I think that's a good idea,\" she said. \"The lesson we can learn from there is in fact that equipping all these local sheriffs with these very powerful and very indiscriminate and very dangerous weapons causes substantial injury and harm to people.\"\n\nNone of the weapons have yet been deployed, but counties have stocked up. Beltrami County, which is located near but not on the pipeline route, even submitted an invoice requesting reimbursement from the Enbridge-funded escrow account for more than $10,000 in less-lethal weapons, including batons, pepper spray, impact munitions, and tear gas grenades, despite the restriction.\n\nHart rejected those requests but approved $911,060 in other reimbursements, including approximately $170,00 worth of equipment: mostly tactical and crowd control gear, as well as miscellaneous items. Reimbursements, for example, were made for port-a-potty rentals, which are considered personal protective equipment because, according to Hart, \"the toilets protect jail employees from biological exposure during jail overcrowding.\" Among other approved \" personal protective equipment \" are baton stops, which attach a baton to officers' duty belts, and gas masks, which protect officers from the tear gas they deploy.\n\nShanai Matteson, an opponent of the Line 3 who is from Guida's county, said it feels inevitable that tear gas and other munitions will be used. \"What you practice for, and the mindset you have, is what you bring. They're soldiering up to protect a private company's assets, so what do we think is going to happen?\" Matteson said. \"Stopping work on a project that's destroying the place that we live is not the same as violence that would warrant this kind of a response.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "ICE Is Teaming With North Carolina Republicans to Fight Pro-Immigrant Sheriffs\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nNo government agency feels more aggrieved lately than ICE, and in North Carolina it is working with the government to do something about it.\n\nThe First Amendment to the Constitution serves as something of a gauge for our national priorities. Embedded in there is the right of the people \"to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\"\n\nBut what if the government itself is aggrieved? No government agency feels more under siege lately than U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and in North Carolina, it's helping the government do something about that.\n\nOver the course of four days in February, federal immigration officials arrested more than 220 undocumented people in North Carolina. They were retaliating against five newly elected sheriffs who had announced they would cut certain ties with ICE.\n\nRepublicans in the state legislature passed a bill Wednesday that would force sheriffs to cooperate with the agency. And ICE helped them to craft it. The North Carolina Sheriff's Association announced that it opposed the bill hours before it passed.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\n\"The GOP leaders are being very candid, very straight up in saying that they are introducing this bill because they have been in communication with ICE,\" Stefania Arteaga told The Intercept.\n\nArteaga is the statewide immigrant rights organizer with the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina. She also co-founded Comunidad Colectiva, a grassroots immigrant rights group working in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden ran and won last year on ending the county's participation in the controversial 287(g) program, which allowed voluntary participation between local law enforcement and ICE.\n\nNow, federal immigration authorities are fighting back. \"This is what ICE wants,\" Arteaga said.\n\nThe bill's top sponsor, Republican state Rep. Destin Hall, told attendees at a committee hearing Monday that \"it's no secret that we've actually worked with federal law enforcement officers in crafting this bill.\" Hall's spokesperson David Cobb told The Intercept that his office had worked with ICE on the bill via phone and \"mobile communication.\" Asked whether ICE or Hall's office initiated communication on the bill, Cobb said he wasn't sure.\n\nHall also told local news in March that he worked with ICE on the bill. He said he learned more about the conflict between sheriffs and ICE by \"working with ICE on this bill, getting some direction from them, hearing from them about the problems that they're facing.\"\n\nAn ICE spokesperson said the agency isn't lobbying for the bill, just provided information to lawmakers. \"The premise that we are working with local officials 'to pass a bill' is not accurate,\" spokesperson Bryan Cox told The Intercept in an email. \"The same information provided to state officials in North Carolina we've also provided to journalists and other groups,\" he continued. \"That said, while we do not advocate for or against any specific legislation, this agency has repeatedly spoken in general as to the public safety consequences of non-cooperation with ICE,\" Cox said. \"Any local jurisdiction thinking that refusing to cooperate with ICE will result in a decrease in local immigration enforcement is mistaken. Local jurisdictions that choose to not cooperate with ICE are likely to see an increase in ICE enforcement activity, as in jurisdictions that do not cooperate with ICE the agency has no choice but to conduct more at-large arrest operations.\"\n\nCox said field office leadership did not have an in-person meeting on this particular topic, but that \"in general we routinely meet with legislators and their staffs just as we do with activist groups, journalists, community organizations, etc.\"\n\nThat kind of liaising with lawmakers is concerning for Julie Mao, an attorney with the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild. \"It's pretty unusual for ICE agents to educate legislative actors on bills and writing them,\" she said. \"I think there is a difference between responding to press,\" Mao explained, \"and going to Destin Hall and helping him understand and draft a bill.\"\n\nNorth Carolina sheriffs' offices for years had been working hand in hand with ICE in its efforts to intimidate and arrest undocumented people. Under the 287(g) program in Mecklenburg county, local law enforcement have transferred more than 15,000 thousand people to ICE over the past 13 years in Charlotte alone. ICE's field director for the region said the mass arrests in February were \"the direct conclusion of dangerous policies of not cooperating\" with the agency.\n\nBut last year, voters in the state's seven largest counties elected new Democratic sheriffs, all of whom are black and five of whom announced they won't cooperate with certain ICE programs and ran on progressive reforms to policing last year. Five are the first black sheriffs to be elected in their respective county's history. Those wins were the result of intense organizing around the 287(g) program and a growing sense of shared concerns between communities of immigrants and people of color regarding interactions with law enforcement, advocates say.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump was elected, Mao told The Intercept, \"a lot of these counties experienced tremendous increases in law enforcement interaction with ICE to transfer people.\"\n\n\"A lot of community members were quite concerned that this whole process was disappearing a significant amount of community,\" Mao said. In Charlotte, those concerns intersected with a larger movement around police accountability and overpolicing in communities of color, she explained. That's how McFadden came into the picture, Mao said; he was \"committed to figuring out progressive criminal justice policies in the jail, with the end of their ICE collaboration program being one component of it.\"\n\nSheriffs Bobby Kimbrough, Gerald Baker, Clarence Birkhead, Quentin Miller, and McFadden announced they would change the way their offices cooperated with ICE, including ending cooperation with 287(g) or no longer honoring \"detainer\" requests, which keep people in prison for up to 48 hours beyond their release date so that ICE can pick them up.\n\nSean Gallagher, Atlanta field office director for ICE, talked about the increased arrests his office is making and attributed it to McFadden's cancellation of the 287(g) program at the local jail.\n\n\"This is really a bill that is retaliatory in nature, that is there to uphold the needs of the Trump deportation pipeline,\" Arteaga said. \"This is not only ICE working with state representatives to undermine the will of voters to propose legislation that is blatantly there to create racial profiling,\" but also to \"literally undermine black sheriffs.\"\n\nThe bill, HB 370, Hall said , would ask sheriffs housing \"illegal immigrants who've been charged with a crime in our state\" to \"simply notify ICE, let them know that they have someone there who they suspect is probably an illegal immigrant, and let ICE do their job.\"\n\nUnlike similar measures in Texas and Arizona , HB 370 forces sheriff's deputies to ask people about their immigration status regardless of the type of criminal charge they face . And it mandates officers to report and hand people over to ICE, and to comply with any ICE request accompanied by a detainer.\n\nNorth Carolina's state legislature has a knack for garnering national attention for extremely conservative measures. Perhaps the most notable was the controversial 2016 \"bathroom bill\" that would have forced transgender people to use the bathroom for the gender on their birth certificate. The state has faced intense backlash over discriminatory voter ID laws too. A federal court in 2016 struck down a law that judges said \"targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision.\" In that case, legislators admitted in court filings that they wanted to partially stop Sunday voting in order to suppress the black vote.\n\nThe state's Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper repealed parts of the notorious bathroom bill, and advocates hope that he'll veto HB 370. \"He's conservative for a Democrat,\" Arteaga said about Cooper. \"This would really be Gov. Cooper's first opportunity to veto a bill that will really harm communities of color,\" she said. It remains to be seen if the legislature has enough votes to sustain a veto, she explained, \"for the first time in a very long time.\"\n\nAfter the new sheriffs were elected, ICE's retaliation was swift, Mao said. In Asheville in February, ICE agents - wearing identifying uniforms, but driving a vehicle resembling that of an employment contractor, with ladders on top - went into a Hendersonville community and arrested four people.\n\nEarlier this year, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department held a forum at a church community center in Charlotte and invited immigrants and undocumented people to talk to police chiefs and McFadden, the sheriff. ICE agents showed up there too.\n\n\"ICE was there as this intimidating force,\" Mao said. \"And we had to file a civil rights complaint, because ICE is not supposed to come into churches,\" she explained. \"So just taking really abusive, rogue actions, even for an ICE office that's traditionally known to be aggressive and have high arrest rates.\"\n\nFreedom Caucus Chair and North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican, said he supported the state legislature's efforts to increase cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement. But he thinks those efforts should focus on people with a criminal record, he told The Intercept. The bill would only impact those charged with a crime, including things like traffic violations or driving without a license. Under state law, undocumented people cannot legally obtain a license. \"In the 11th District, there is some criminal component\" to the cooperation with ICE, \"it is not a dragnet just to get people that are here illegally without a criminal record,\" Meadows said. Only a quarter of the people arrested in the February raids had criminal records.\n\n\"I think the legislature is looking at making sure that detainer language is honored, which is very different than 287(g),\" Meadows said. \"I would support them in their efforts to make sure that our chief constitutional law enforcement officers in every county helps enforce the laws. And yet we don't want them to become ICE agents,\" he said. \"Working with local sheriffs in my area, I know there was one of the sheriffs that decided not to be involved in the 287(g) program, but they do plan to honor the detainer language. And I think that that's a good middle ground place to be.\"\n\nMeadows said he had a problem with cases in which sheriffs say they won't honor ICE detainers. \"That's creating sanctuary counties, and I think that that's the wrong way to go,\" he said. Meadows said he doesn't see a problem with the continued blurring of lines between federal and state law enforcement when it comes to cooperating with ICE. \"It's more of a political problem than it is an enforcement problem. So I think some of the sheriffs are getting political blowback from their communities, and I understand that,\" he said. \"At the same time, if we've got criminals that have been apprehended and they are scheduled to be deported or should be deported, I think that working hand in glove with both federal and local law enforcement agencies is the proper course.\"\n\nRep. Alma Adams, a Democrat representing North Carolina's 12th District, isn't surprised by the legislature's efforts. \"They do a lot of crazy stuff there. I served there, I can tell you,\" Adams told The Intercept. \"When they talk about local control, which the general assembly talks about all the time, I think they need to be a little more supportive of the sheriffs,\" she said. \"I certainly am supportive of what they're doing. We are just targeting people of color who we think may be immigrants. And I don't think that's right,\" she said. Adams said she hadn't seen the bill but would take a look at it.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

Asked about the fact that voters elected the new sheriffs in large part because of their stances on changing how law enforcement works with ICE, Rouzer said he still thought voters were unified on the issue. \"I think if you were to poll the citizens of North Carolina, probably 65, 70 percent would be in favor of the sheriffs coordinating with ICE. The legislature is a reflection of the state as a whole. And I think the citizens at large would support what they're doing.\"\n\nThere's confusion around the role local law enforcement should be playing when it comes to helping ICE. \"I think that disconnect is being led purposely by the GOP,\" Arteaga said, \"to accomplish their goal of swaying misinformed voters.\"\n\nBut it's clear that a large coalition of groups - not just immigrant rights organizers - see a problem with increasing cooperation between state and federal law enforcement.\n\nSupport for Comunidad Colectiva's organizing against 287(g) \"expanded very much outside of POC groups,\" Arteaga said. Fifty-eight organizations, including local and national groups, signed onto letter asking former Mecklenburg Sheriff Irwin Carmichael to end cooperation with ICE. \"There's a large segment of communities that see issues of immigration as part of their issue as well,\" Arteaga said, \"whether it's education, LGBTQ rights, or women's issues.\"\n\nWAIT!

(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nPrivate donors including big-box stores, fossil fuel companies, and tech giants are secretly giving hundreds of millions of dollars annually to law enforcement agencies and related foundations, allowing police to buy specialized weapons and technology with little public oversight.\n\nExperts say this huge deluge of police \"dark money\" funding, detailed in a new University of Chicago working paper and in an additional analysis shared exclusively with the Lever , leaves law enforcement beholden to the companies and powerful donors bankrolling them, rather than the communities that officers are sworn to serve.\n\n\"The big-picture finding is that the world of private donations to police is a lot bigger and more complex than previously estimated,\" said Robert Vargas, a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago and a coauthor of the study.\n\nThe study, which analyzed a database of nonprofit tax returns, found that from 2014 to 2019, more than six hundred private donors and organizations collectively funneled $461 million to police and to other nonprofits supporting police - a figure that, Vargas said, was \"without a doubt an undercount,\" as it was based on organizations' own disclosures about their giving.\n\nThe private money comes in part from big retailers like Target and Walmart ; oil companies like Chevron and Shell ; and Microsoft and other Big Tech players - companies that have touted their support of law enforcement for years.\n\nThe new research exposes how easily private donors can secretly funnel money to police. Anonymous donors use asset managers like Fidelity Investments to fund the litany of police foundations and other opaque nonprofit organizations that support police work, the researchers found. The clandestine funds have made Fidelity's charitable arm one of the largest private donors to police in the country.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, private funding for police comes with virtually no oversight and can be used to buy surveillance technology, high-tech weapons, and other items that agencies might otherwise struggle to justify.\n\nFor instance, the Baltimore Police Department for years used private money to fund a secret aerial surveillance program that could track the locations of people throughout the city in real time. Billionaire philanthropists in Texas provided money for the program, but routed the funds through a nonprofit in Baltimore, which allowed the program to stay, for a time, out of the public eye. When news of the program became public, it caused an outcry, and was eventually ruled unconstitutional in court.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the city's police department used money from Target - also routed through a local police foundation - to purchase software from Palantir, venture capitalist Peter Thiel's data analytics company, that provides police massive amounts of sensitive data and purports to identify crime \"hot spots.\"\n\nIn Philadelphia, privately funded police nonprofits have purchased ballistic helmets, drones, motorcycles, and even horses for the city's police department.\n\nSuch surveillance technology and military gear is deployed disproportionately in black communities and low-income neighborhoods. The heightened surveillance intensifies local policing , which research has shown can harm community health and well-being.\n\nPrivate funding represents a tiny fraction of the money that states and cities spend on police, which by some estimates amounts to more than $100 billion annually.\n\n\"In comparison to their municipal budgets, it seems like a drop in the bucket,\" said Gin Armstrong, the executive director of LittleSis, a group that researches corporate power and influence.\n\nBut the money has an outsized impact, Armstrong argued.\n\n\"It's really important to look at how this [private] money is being spent,\" she said. \"Most of the money in municipal budgets is going to salaries and benefits. This is going to equipment and experimental technology, and it's all outside of public discussion, and often even outside of public reporting.\" It was, Armstrong continued, a \"huge slush fund that is completely unaccountable.\"\n\n\"Now we have a sense of just how big that slush fund is,\" she said.\n\nOne of the most common ways that private donations, whether from oil companies, billionaires, or big-box retailers, make their way to law enforcement is through police foundations, nonprofits established to support law enforcement in a particular city, such as the New York City Police Foundation and the Los Angeles Police Foundation.\n\nAccording to public data from the city of New York , the New York City Police Department reported $30 million in private donations from 2019 to 2022, of which $26.8 million - nearly 90 percent - came from the New York City Police Foundation.\n\nPolice foundations position themselves as charities, soliciting donations and then providing that money to local law enforcement. Their supporters say that the work can improve officer morale and that the additional funding can supplement strained public budgets - although municipal police tend to be flush with public resources .\n\n\"I refer to [police foundations] as a kind of shell corporation,\" said Kevin Walby, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Winnipeg who studies police foundations in the United States and Canada. \"They can move money around in ways that public bodies can't. They don't really have robust reporting or disclosure mechanisms.\" The term \"dark money,\" he said, was an appropriate way to describe their support.\n\nPolice foundations, like most charities, do not have to publicly report their donors. Until an exposé from the Intercept , for instance, the New York City Police Foundation did not disclose that it received a $1 million donation from the United Arab Emirates in 2012, even when that money was passed directly along to the police to support \"criminal investigations\" in the city.\n\nThere are some two hundred fifty police foundations in the United States, of which nearly 80 percent say that they fund technology and equipment for police, as well as programming for officers and public relations campaigns. While such organizations have been around for decades, Walby said they have grown steadily since the 1990s, particularly in response to calls to limit the ever-increasing public funding for police, which has nearly tripled over the last several decades. Research has documented increasing revenues for police foundations year after year.\n\n\"A big period of growth happened after 2020,\" Walby said, adding that it was in \"direct response\" to the protests over the murder of George Floyd in May of that year. \"They were using corporate money as a kind of backstop to buttress themselves against the defund [the police] movement.\"\n\nThe corporate bankrollers of police foundations often appear to get a good return on their investments. Target, for instance, has long funded surveillance and anti-crime programs in cities across the country, successfully promoting crackdowns on retail theft and petty crime in disinvested neighborhoods over other, arguably more pressing , community concerns.\n\nIn St Louis, the city's police chief receives $100,000 a year directly from the local police foundation in addition to his salary, an arrangement that critics say has ensured that the department is beholden to local business interests.\n\nPrevious research has shown that police foundations receive tens of millions of dollars annually from private donors. But the new research by Vargas and his coauthors shows that such local foundations are in fact part of a far broader network of nonprofits and funds dedicated to funneling private money and in-kind gifts to police - one that involves hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThe new study identified hundreds of dark-money organizations that finance police departments - sometimes donating directly to law enforcement, and sometimes donating to other police nonprofits, creating a tangled web of donors and intermediaries.\n\nCollectively, those organizations gave more than $826 million in donations over a six-year period, and reported revenues of more than $16 billion, according to additional analysis that the researchers shared with the Lever .\n\nThe organizations include associations of sheriffs and police chiefs, national nonprofits like the police charity 100 Club, and private foundations like that of wealthy police advocate Howard Buffett , the son of billionaire Warren Buffett. Furthermore, the researchers found, some police foundations - like those in New York City, St Louis, and San Diego - donated not only to the police agency in their own city, but to other law enforcement agencies around the country.\n\n\"This is an important set of findings because it reveals in real terms the amount of capital that is flowing, and it reveals the number of corporate nodes in the network,\" Walby said.\n\nFinancial services companies like Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab also appear in the data as some of the biggest donors to police dark-money groups. Both companies allow wealthy individuals to funnel money to nonprofits through \"donor-advised funds,\" charitable investment accounts that are an increasingly popular way to anonymize donations and get a tax break at the same time. Various police foundations have begun advertising this funding arrangement as one way to donate.\n\n\"The truth is that if somebody wanted to donate a lot of money and hide their tracks, all they would do is make a donation to a police nonprofit from a donor-advised fund, and then there's essentially no paper trail,\" Vargas said.\n\nWhile critics have pushed for additional transparency and regulation around donor-advised funds , describing them as an unaccountable form of billionaire philanthropy, federal regulators have appeared hesitant to launch a major crackdown. Last November, the Internal Revenue Service proposed some modest limitations on their use to rein in spending on lobbying and other noncharitable causes - and police charities are among the entities that have opposed the new rules.\n\nPolice foundations and other private donors have also found ways to limit disclosure about the gifts they provide to police, the researchers found. When the researchers looked at Chicago as a case study, they found that 90 percent of private donations to police went unreported, revealing, they wrote, \"police finance organizations' interest in keeping their funding of police secret.\"\n\nFor the most part, the millions in dark-money funding that police agencies receive each year is perfectly legal - presenting a challenge for those who want to see greater transparency.\n\n\"There are largely no laws or policies governing foundation donations to the police,\" said Evan Feeney, the deputy senior campaign director at Color of Change, an advocacy group that has opposed corporate backing of police.\n\nThe foundations have thus created a kind of loophole, one that \"legally allows officers and departments to take gifts from vendors, sidestepping conflict of interest and donor disclosure rules,\" Feeney said. Palantir, for instance, has donated to police foundations that subsequently funded law enforcement purchases of Palantir's own data analytics technology.\n\nEven in places that require official city approval of gifts from foundations, like Los Angeles, such a process has often appeared to be a formality , with gifts being rubber-stamped by local officials over the opposition of local communities and activists.\n\n\"Cities must end these untraceable donations and require that any equipment, device, technology, or software that is purchased or donated through a police foundation is subject to disclosure, oversight, and accountability laws,\" Feeney said.\n\nThere has been some movement on the issue. In January, New York City enacted a law , with the grudging support of the local police, that will require the police department to provide an annual report on how it spends the millions in private donations that it receives, both from the foundation and other sources. Unlike its use of public dollars, the department has not previously been required to disclose how it uses private funding.\n\nThe law also requires the New York Police Department to provide information on its private donors. But because many of these donations are routed through the New York City Police Foundation, the donors will likely still remain anonymous.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nKatya Schwenk is a journalist based in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

To defund the police, we'll have to challenge their power head-on.\n\nMembers of the Minneapolis Police Department on June 11, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn recent weeks, as protests erupted in Minneapolis and around the country over the police killing of George Floyd, Minnesota lawmakers promised quick action : they'd make it easier to fire abusive officers, raise the standard for using deadly force, give the attorney general (rather than local district attorneys) the authority to charge and prosecute abusive cops, ban choke holds and \"warrior-style\" training , and fund community-based violence intervention programs. These measures wouldn't defund or dismantle the police. They were quite modest, given the breadth of protests and radical demands emanating from the movement. Still, on the morning of June 20, the Minnesota Legislature ended its special session without passing a single police bill.\n\nIn a moment of deep pain and anguish, with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets to press for an end to state violence - risking their safety from police reprisal and coronavirus - how can lawmakers turn their backs on this uprising?\n\nThe answer for many is police unions. But the problem isn't just the police or other law enforcement unions. Scholarship on criminal justice policymaking in the United States finds that a multisided law enforcement lobby, made up of prison guard unions, district attorney associations, sheriffs' associations, police chief organizations, and, yes, police unions, wields inordinate power. In our research on California , Florida , Texas , and other states, we've chronicled how the lobby has blocked efforts to change sentencing laws, abolish solitary confinement, outlaw capital punishment, close prisons and jails, end commercial bail, and on and on. Legislators tell us outright: major reform legislation has little chance of passing unless law enforcement is on board (or gets out of the way).\n\nTo reimagine policing and end mass incarceration, or even achieve meaningful reforms, we must reckon with the political power law enforcement interest groups have accrued.\n\nThe law enforcement lobby grew in size and clout beginning in the 1970s, as states and the federal government poured money into policing, prosecution, and punishment. In the 1990s, with politicians competing to be seen as the toughest on crime (especially crime associated with black and brown people), law enforcement groups - and the retributive crime victim's organizations they supported - became kingmakers. Every politician wanted men and women in uniform behind them. In return, law enforcement organizations learned to reward political friends with endorsements and financial contributions and punish enemies through negative campaigning and accusations about being soft on crime.\n\nToday, the law enforcement lobby has power in numbers. Organizations pool resources, delegate tasks, and present a unified front. In California, a formidable coalition has been instrumental in passing and protecting ultra-punitive sentencing laws. In New York, law enforcement organizations spearheaded a successful campaign to gut bail reforms passed last year. By joining forces, these groups overwhelm political adversaries, typically civil liberties and community groups with less money and fewer connections.\n\nSometimes, the power of law enforcement organizations is easy to see. The groups run ads and publicly pronounce that reforms will lead to crime, death, and anarchy. After New York State passed major bail reform legislation in 2019, the New York City police union declared, \"Our elected leaders are putting kids in harm's way by making child porn a bail-free crime.\" Not only will this lobby use public shaming against its political opponents, but also against colleagues who won't fall in line. Police unions and allied politicians have harassed, protested, and tried to oust progressive prosecutors, especially black women, who are committed to racial justice and reducing mass incarceration.\n\nAt other times, the lobby's influence sometimes takes less obvious forms. The organizations work behind closed doors, using their unique access to ostensibly educate lawmakers about the issues. Positioning themselves as the only legitimate experts on crime control, they reinforce the belief that intensive policing, harsh sentencing laws, and incarceration are imperative to protect public safety. As a result, politicians torpedo, water down, or defer reform measures .\n\nDuring the Minnesota Legislature's special session, law enforcement successfully advocated delaying action - a common tactic that allows time for public pressure to subside and lobby pressure to intensify.\n\nSo is the law enforcement lobby too powerful to dislodge? Recent developments suggest not.\n\nThe pressure to break law enforcement's choke hold on criminal justice policy is growing. Even Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradando said on 60 Minutes last month that leaders of his city's police union \"are going to have to come to a reckoning that either they are going to be on the right side of history . . . or, they will be left behind.\"\n\nA combination of activists, journalists, and organized labor have portrayed cop unions as self-interested organizations that block meaningful reforms and protect officers that brutalize people. If pressure continues to build, more public officials may be emboldened to acknowledge and limit police unions' power through legislation and contract negotiations . If the narrative sticks, it also could make law enforcement endorsements less valuable, decreasing the incentive for legislators to act on the organizations' behalf.\n\nRising voices are demanding lawmakers reject, return, or donate contributions from police and prison officer unions. Reform-minded district attorneys in California have asked the American Bar Association to ban police unions from contributing to prosecutorial campaigns, specifically to avoid conflicts of interest. Citizens United is a roadblock to barring spending on campaigns because it allows law enforcement unions, like corporations, to spend unlimited amounts on independent expenditures. But efforts to stigmatize law enforcement contributions could achieve similar ends if electoral candidates come to believe, to quote a New York activist , \"taking police money implies that you're actively OK with cops murdering black men or torturing people in jails.\"\n\nThere are fewer direct efforts to limit the prosecutor association's political power; reformers have instead focused on electing progressive district attorneys. They have seen some success, with renegade DAs beginning to assert independence, breaching the idea that all prosecutors share the same views . If more progressive DAs win office, there's hope they'll form their own associations to serve as a political counterweight to their tough-on-crime colleagues.\n\nThe barriers to a dramatic shift of power are formidable. Yet we've seen that disruptive politics can rapidly change the political playing field, forcing politicians to listen to people from heavily policed and imprisoned communities. By refusing to cooperate - taking over streets, threatening property, and disrupting commerce - Black Lives Matter and local activist groups like Minneapolis's Black Visions Collective have challenged the legitimacy of the police, swayed public opinion, and forced policymakers to consider changes once seen as impossible.\n\nWith protesters still in the streets, a handful of cities have acted boldly, cutting police budgets, removing police from schools, and ending violent tactics like no-knock warrants and choke holds. Colorado recently passed a major legislative package that includes ending qualified immunity , which has shielded cops from civil liability for violating people's constitutional rights.\n\nMinneapolis seemed poised to go further when a veto-proof majority of the City Council publicly committed to dismantling the police. But the council then announced it would begin a year-long process of engaging \"with every willing community member in Minneapolis.\" Law enforcement groups and their allies, we suspect, will use the long pause to frighten voters, lobby city officials, and resist major changes. As politicians hold hearings, experts conduct studies, and public pressure decreases, law enforcement moves the conversation from systemic transformation to watered-down reform.\n\nNow that huge majorities of people in Minneapolis and elsewhere express support for Black Lives Matter and criminal justice reform , it's critical to keep up the pressure. Policymakers need to understand that they can't turn their backs on this uprising, and that adjourning without action is shameful - even riskier than taking on the law enforcement lobby.\n\nJoshua Page is associate professor of sociology and law at the University of Minnesota.\n\nHeather Schoenfeld is associate professor of sociology at Boston University.\n\nMichael Campbell is associate professor of sociology and criminology at Denver University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Ruth Wilson Gilmore argues that the prison-industrial complex is a holistic social organizing principle that pervades life under capitalism.\n\nMost of the dollars that flow through the prison-industrial complex originate from public treasuries. (Emiliano Bar / Unsplash)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nBetween the 1980s and the mid-2000s, the population of California's prisons and jails grew by a staggering 500 percent. In her 2007 book, Golden Gulag , Ruth Wilson Gilmore showed that California's mass incarceration was a not a response to violence, a drug epidemic, or even the crime rate: rather, it was a political-economic strategy that came out of a series of economic crises, which left behind a surplus of unused labor, land, capital, and state capacity. This surplus went into what one state report described as \"the biggest prison building project in the history of the world.\"\n\nWith this definitive Marxist analysis, Gilmore established herself as a leading abolitionist critic of the prison-industrial complex. Earlier this year, she released Abolition Geography: Essays Towards Liberation , an essay collection featuring an introduction from two other groundbreaking radical scholars: Alberto Toscano and Brenna Bhandar. A codirector of the Centre for Philosophy and Critical Thought at Goldsmiths, University of London, Toscano is the author of Fanaticism: On the Uses of an Idea and coeditor of The SAGE Handbook of Marxism . Bhandar is a law professor at the University of British Columbia, the author of Colonial Lives of Property: Law, Land, and Racial Regimes of Ownership , and a coeditor of Revolutionary Feminisms: Conversations on Collective Action and Radical Thought .\n\nDaniel Denvir recently interviewed Gilmore, Toscano, and Bhandar for The Dig , a podcast from Jacobin Radio . In their conversation, which has been edited for clarity, these thinkers take on the many urgent questions that face the Left as we attempt to understand and confront mass incarceration: Where do the prison-industrial complex's boundaries lie? Is the neoliberal state suffering from a legitimacy crisis? And what is the relationship between abolitionist organizing in the United States and global struggles against capitalism, racism, and colonialism?\n\nWhat is the prison-industrial complex, and why is it a useful concept for thinking about the American carceral state?\n\nThe idea for conceptualizing what we have come to describe as mass incarceration using the term \"prison-industrial complex\" first materialized in an article that Mike Davis published about twenty years ago in the Nation. What Mike launched into our consciousness was a provocation to think about prison, punishment, and the carceral in as expansive of a way as we had learned to think about the military-industrial complex. While a number of people over the years have written about what that complex consists of, I think I probably have written the most, or at least gone on at the most length, in part because as a PhD student I studied the military-industrial complex to shreds at the seminar table of the economist and socialist Ann Markusen.\n\nThe prison-industrial complex consists of the uniformed and civilian personnel who work anywhere from the streets to the courts, to the jails, to the prisons, to the postprison-release programs, and so forth. It includes the boosters in the towns or neighborhoods where prisons and jails are built. It includes the intellectuals, including myself, who make their living either designing or condemning the design of systems of punishment. It includes finance capitalists who lend money to states and municipalities to build or improve their lockup systems. It includes the various firms that sell goods and services to states and municipalities, including the federal government, in order to keep people locked up or to keep them under surveillance when they're not locked up. So that can be anything from food service to ankle monitors and anything in between.\n\nAll that put together is the prison-industrial complex. Most of the dollars that flow through it originate from public treasuries, and they fall into the hands of people in the forms of wages, salaries, utility bills, and everything else it takes to keep the lights on. The money also becomes interest payments to bondholders, who have lent money to governments to build these kinds of facilities, even though those same lenders, many of which are pension plans, might have lent money to governments to build schools or parks or museums or dams or highways.\n\nI have very little to add to the detail of Ruthie's analysis, except perhaps the way in which a focus on the prison or a focus on incarceration and criminalization can occlude all of the institutions, mediations, agents, and agencies that Ruthie just mapped. And that's an issue we deal with in the introduction to our book. The proposal to put the prison at the center of our conceptualization of state-building and state capacity and struggles over states - especially in the United States but elsewhere as well - could be misunderstood as focusing on the prison as the singular architectural and punishment site for the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of people in the US but also in other contexts. The dialectical proposition that we both found worthwhile to engage with in Ruthie's work is precisely the idea that a single-minded focus on the prison in isolation from all of those mediations is a way of not thinking about how mass incarceration operates in the broader political economy.\n\nIt's a reminder for me of that great line that Bertolt Brecht borrowed: \"A photograph of the Krupp works or the AEG tells us next to nothing about these institutions.\" In other words, the industrial complex of early-twentieth-century Germany doesn't tell you anything about the social relations that make it possible. And our culture is suffused with fetishistic and horrifying and at times well-intentioned images of prisons that totally disappear everything that Ruthie is talking about in this book and everything about her activism.\n\nFor me, the way that Ruthie's elaborated the concept of the prison-industrial complex becomes a way of thinking about global capitalism. It becomes a kind of method, a method of inquiry. The way that she, just a few moments ago, excavated what is congealed in this thing called the \"prison-industrial complex\" represents, for me, a way of seeing that is enormously helpful in mapping or thinking about something that otherwise seems completely overwhelming and totalizing. We can get into the dialectical aspects of Ruthie's elaboration of the prison-industrial complex further into our conversation. But it really strikes me when she includes herself in the class of people - intellectuals, organizers, and so on - who are also part of this prison-industrial complex. It recalls Cedric Robinson's thinking about how dialectics operate in the constitution of something that comes to look solid and totalizing and absolute: his idea is that this dialectic also involves resistance, revolt, and contradiction. Often, I think that gets lost.\n\nAnyway, those were some of the things that came to my mind while listening to Ruthie speak. You know, Ruthie, even having read and reread your work so much, I still find myself taking notes when you speak, which is another thing that we can get into more in this conversation: how dynamic and fluid this way of thinking is, so that there's something very alive in these conversations, even if we are bringing out similar themes repeatedly. There is a sense of movement that's part of thinking in this way, and I find it really generative.\n\nThere's also, though, this narrow popular reading of the term \"prison-industrial complex\" that emphasizes private prisons and a cruder sense of the profit motive. What do we miss about the political economy of the carceral state when we see it as simply the product of corporate greed for profits?\n\nIt's a shame that the concept of the prison-industrial complex has atrophied in the way that it has. In the '90s, as the rudiments of social movements started to arise, people grasped the term, thinking, \"This is telling us something that we hadn't thought about before, something that we should think about.\" But the tendency has been to narrow, narrow, narrow, to some notion of, as you said, private prisons and corporate greed. Now, empirically - which is to say if you just counted up who's in prison, who runs prisons,  and who benefits from prisons - you'll find that private prisons are a minimal part of the entire thing in the United States, quite unlike in the UK.\n\nBut the problem that I have debated with some very well-known people has been around the question of whether thinking about private prisons might be the gateway for people to think about capitalism. And my conclusion, after more than twenty years of trying to do that, is that thinking about private prisons is not the gateway. Private prisons are a particular thing, a particular form of parasite capitalism. They really do exist. But they don't drive the system, they are not the cause of the system, and they are not the system's destiny. In many parts of the world and in many parts of the United States, the prison and jail system can be wholly public, and it's no less deadly for the people locked up and for communities than it is in places where part of the system has been contracted out to private companies.\n\nBut let me take this discussion in a slightly different direction, encouraged as I am by what Alberto and Brenna were talking about. If we think about the prison-industrial complex in terms of contradiction, we must move to another level of generalization or abstraction and ask: What are the fundamental things that the prison-industrial complex is made of? The fundamental things are land, labor, money capital, and the state's capacity to organize these things. That analysis gives us an entry into thinking about racial capitalism and the capitalist state. What happens when labor is in surplus? What has happened to the composition of public sector workers? What has happened to the churn of money capital through the public sector over time?\n\nThere are so many questions that we can then turn our attention to, that might give us some stronger indication of where and how to fight, because the only purpose of doing any of this analysis at all is figuring out where and how to fight. To go back to the private-prison issue for a moment: if getting rid of private prison contracts were the pathway to dismantling and dissolving the system, it would have already happened in places like the state of Tennessee or in immigrant detention, because of the huge win in dismissing the contract for a private immigrant detention center in Hutto, Texas, or some recent positive outcomes in the Pacific Northwest around private immigrant-detention contracts. However, nothing changes other than the contract, which gives us some insight into which fights, though they may be energetic, don't prevent people from being locked up.\n\nI'm thinking back also about the first time I read Golden Gulag , which was actually on a flight to Los Angeles, appropriately. The image that transpires, especially from that work, is of what one could call a \"prison-deindustrialization complex.\" One of the things that I found really striking about Golden Gulag was that it triggered the kind of gestalt switch in perception you get from theory that works: the book actually allowed me to rethink the meaning of deindustrialization. In some sense, the notion of the prison- and military-industrial complex is suffused with a postwar notion of the economy and also a postwar notion of profits.\n\nWhat emerges from Golden Gulag and from the connected essays published in Abolition Geography is a way of reading and seeing and acting in the geography of deindustrialization, especially in California, and actually making it palpable as a site of state and capital strategies but also as a site of organizing, which is usually entirely neglected by 99.9 percent of liberals and many Marxists as well. This is the whole dimension of what Ruthie borrows from Terry McGee, the \"desakota,\" the neither urban nor rural. The concept also comes out in Phil Neel's book on hinterlands: a space that's not just left behind and not just forgotten but a space that's deeply significant for all of these moves and reconfigurations of political economies and state strategies and everyday livelihoods. I found that very powerful because I think there is a static way of thinking about processes of urbanization and then of kind of surplus-ing, of what used to be the rural and is now an unthinkable wasteland populated by scary voters for reactionary projects.\n\nBut the image that transpires in Ruthie's book is a very different one. Continuing the earlier question about what an expansive notion of the prison-industrial complex may allow one to think, it actually makes visible sites of theory and struggle and also domains that go well beyond thinking just about incarceration. That can be a starting point for asking questions like: What is the shape of contemporary agricultural labor? Those are also things that one learns about through this work. And so I find that element, which is in contradistinction to centering on the prison and certainly centering on the private prison, to be very significant.\n\nI want to spell out some of the history we've been alluding to. Ruthie, you wrote that the prison-industrial complex is an attempt to fix \"major problems [that] appear, materially and ideologically, as surpluses of finance capital, land, labor, and state capacity that have accumulated from a series of overlapping and interlocking crises stretching across three decades.\" What is the relationship between crisis and surplus, and how did the capitalist crises of the 1970s create these surpluses? And how did the prison-industrial complex and what you call the \"anti-state state\" arise in an attempt to fix these crises?\n\nThe simplest way that I can present crisis-in-surplus is to think that when a system goes into crisis, it means that it can't get through to its next day or its next round of whatever it used to do. As a result of that crisis - the system's inability to make its next round, whether it's the next round of reproductive life in the home or its next round of production in the factory or the field or its next round of extensive and wonderful public education for children - then all kinds of things, money, human energy, tools, equipment, buildings, are left aside: they become surplus. And that surplus means that people's time is no longer needed within the formerly existing social system. I am not saying that what existed was necessarily just or good. I am saying the change means that the energy is no longer needed; that money capital that might have flowed through those systems in order to be paid out as wages, or as rents, or as overhead utilities for durable equipment, for food, no longer circulates in the same way. So these are some examples of surplus.\n\nAnother example that I studied many years ago was a number of shifts in the use of formerly irrigated agricultural land in California. Now obviously, not all agricultural land everywhere has experienced the same level of capital investment and improvement as land in the dry west of the United States. But that is another example. It could be coal mines in Kentucky, for quite a different example. So we have surplus, which is to say all kinds of factors of production have been idled, set aside. Money surplus is perhaps the strangest one because people think, \"Oh, wait a second, if there's enough money, why did all of this happen?\" And the answer, of course, brings us to a crude but accurate view of capitalism and the way that money must circulate according to the goals of those who own or control the money capital; money circulating in the form of the social wage through the state depends on a certain legitimacy. That's determined by any number of social actors but certainly not by popular democratic agreement. Then, this churn of unused or idle labor, land, and money capital throws already existing institutions deeper into crisis.\n\nFor example, as happened in the United States, a tax revolt on the part of large banks and corporations did an enormous amount of work in making poor one of the richest political economies in the history of the world: California. But it was artificially made poor because the large banks and corporations could decide to pay lower taxes. And what does that mean? That meant that they could compose a legislative body and elect a governor who would pursue those goals on behalf of those capitalist firms that then left the state. In this case, the State of California, with all kinds of bureaucratic and fiscal capacities, can borrow money, spend money, make things, hire people, train people, you name it, but did not have the legitimacy to put those energies, those organizational and human energies, toward the kinds of purposes that what we used to call the welfare state, however weak, was put.\n\nAre the people who end up getting locked up disproportionately surplus populations as well?\n\nWell, they'd have to be, because if they weren't surplus, somebody would have them working for them. Look, my favorite astonishing number that I have repeated for some time - and it's probably bigger now - is that in the United States of America, the workforce is probably about 160 million people. Of that labor force, more than half are carrying some kind of disqualifying arrest or conviction record, whether or not they've ever been locked up. It's really quite an astonishing thing. And of course, those disqualifying records that modestly educated people in the prime of life carry disqualify them from certain kinds of jobs, which means that if they manage to get work, they are like gig employees, highly vulnerable to any fluctuation in the workplace in America. They're very easy to dismiss. So there's a whole movement that has grown over the last twenty years, organized and led by people who are formerly incarcerated or, as we say nowadays, justice-impacted, to ban the box: to get rid of the questions on employment applications that ask, \"Have you ever been arrested?\"\n\nSurplus population is a thorny category, because for many who try genuinely to understand how racial capitalism works in the United States, the idea of somebody being deprived of their freedom - either ankle-shackled at home with a monitor or locked up in a jail or prison - must lead to those unfree people's labor being exploited. Because otherwise, why bother? But based on empirical reckonings of who actually does what among the two-and-a-third million people locked up at any given moment in the United States, labor exploitation explains virtually nothing. Many people righteously believe, as I used to righteously presume, that somehow continuation of unfreedom must mean a continuation of slavery, which must mean a continuation of labor exploitation. There is exploitation, but it's not labor. What turns into money, that circulates as wages and interest and rent and utility bills and so forth, is time. The people who are locked up are deprived of time, which is to say time is extracted from their lives. They never get it back. Nobody ever gets their time back. And it's the fact of time that transforms into money that circulates in these various ways. If you think back on everything that anybody has ever written to analyze the peculiar condition that capitalism throws entire polities and political economies into, we're reminded that Karl Marx talked about the annihilation of space by time, and that's what happens to people who are imprisoned, one by one by one. We are space, and our spaces, our lives, are annihilated by the extraction of time.\n\nRuthie, you write, \"If economics lies at the base of the prison system, its growth is a function of politics not mechanics.\" Brenna and Alberto, why is it the economic foundation of the prison system that exposes its fundamental political contingency?\n\nThat quotation reminds me of the Clausewitzian idea that politics is a continuation of war by other means, as well as its reversals - how we can think about warfare in not a Clausewitzian sense but maybe warfare as a class war or race war. These other conceptions of war are perhaps continuations of politics by other means. I was reminded of that formulation by the quotation, because in both frameworks, we're thinking about what the material operation of a thing exposes about its own motor force. Before Alberto answers, I wanted to ask Ruthie about this idea of time becoming money, and how the extractivist nature of the prison-industrial complex is the extraction of time that prisoners never get back. Is there some element of speculation involved in that transmutation of time into money?\n\nThat's a really interesting question. I mean, my gut tells me yes, but that those who are speculating are not finger-rubbing venture capitalists who are trying to figure out how to make a dollar into two; rather, I think a lot of this speculation happens in the context of already existing institutions of the state where people are struggling to maintain the agencies that they work in. They turn to what has, over these last thirty or forty years, become apparently the most politically justifiable growth area of the state, and they say, \"We do this, too.\" That's, I think, where the speculation is. We need more officers in the schools because we do this, too. One of my favorite examples is that the US Department of Education has a SWAT team so they can break down your front door if they suspect that you are engaging in student loan fraud. A SWAT team! So there's speculation that more and more people across the life cycle will necessarily require inhibition, prohibition, and punishment in order for any social agency to do what it's supposed to do, whether it's dispense food or education. In Chicago the other day, the mayor closed the most elaborate and fancy park in the city to teenagers. That, of course, makes all of those teenagers available for the work of being policed. And then the police speculate on what more they can do to build their section of the budget.\n\nIndeed, in terms of mission absorption and mission imitation, agencies whose job it is to provide the basic goods of life - education, housing, and so forth - incorporate into their mission policing, exclusion, and punishment. But also, in an effort to resist the constant criticism that abolition-adjacent people have made about \"education, not incarceration\" and so forth, police and jails and prisons are saying, \"Oh, well, give us more money and we will do all of that too. We can do everything.\" So there is a lot of speculation that's attached to the actual extraction of time or the potential identification of people whose time can then become extractable.\n\nThis is really fascinating because we start with something quite counterintuitive. I was thinking of the analogy of property in my head, which is problematic, but also analogous in the sense that there's something very counterintuitive about the idea that you lock up people and extract time, since there's the appearance of nonproductivity. Yet this counterintuitive feature is then taken to these perverse but logical conclusions. Bizarrely, when you map all of the different realms into which the speculation is taken and how it operates, the potential for speculation appears to be limitless.\n\nI think we tend, not just in talking about prisons or incarceration, to operate with a nineteenth-century antinomy, in which economics is a world of anonymous hydraulic functionality and then politics is a world of sovereign, generally masculine decision. The peculiar aspect of this geographical and historical phenomenology of prisons that Ruthie is presenting is the competition between the domains of taxation, of budgets, of different agencies, indeed different police forces - all of whom, for instance, in the vicinity of Saint Louis, are trying to arrest the same African-American drivers as they move through these underfunded police jurisdictions, which are dependent for their own existence on juridically extracting monetary value from racialized subjects. But in that case, it can't be thought of simply as that of a cognitively or psychologically racist police force. They very well might be that, too, but it's also a compulsion. It's a compulsion that puts the politics into the economics.\n\nOne of the things that we're challenged to do by looking with empirical and methodological care at the deployment of the prison-industrial complex is to rethink that relationship, where economics is not just the macro level of the US GDP and class structure, and politics is not just what elite politicians decide or what a set of ideologues think. Those factors might set some boundary conditions for our inquiry, because they of course matter as state and federal policy matters; but politics at the micro and meso levels matter too. People are indeed compelled by the political economy of the institutions of which they're part to engage in certain types of behaviors, which also explains why a purely cognitive or psychological effort to roll back the racist proclivities of individual members of the repressive state apparatus might not get you very far. A police department fully manned by black cops in one of those jurisdictions will have the same compulsion in order to maintain their jobs: to continue arresting modestly educated working people in their area. So, when we think of politics vis-à-vis economics it should be through political economy, political economy as constant critique - not as some domain of objectivity that allows us to map why people behave in certain ways despite their intentions.\n\nTo follow up on what Alberto was just saying and the terrific question that Brenna put to me, I have been thinking about territory as the fundamental condition of what we understand to be states: that states have this territorial jurisdiction and also, to pick up on the word that Alberto used, sovereignty. I'm not embracing the liberal notion of sovereignty, but I do want to point out its importance to what we're talking about. The liberal notion of the sovereign individual allegedly has domain over the territory of herself, and it's exactly the evacuation or the cancellation of that sovereignty that makes people who are criminalized, whether they be incarcerated or not, vulnerable to time extraction. It's the end of sovereignty. They're not people who are lacking sovereigns; they are people who do not have sovereignty.\n\nAt the same time, states are of course complex and contradictory sets of institutions. They are subjects and objects of struggle. Certain arms of the state, especially the forces of organized violence, the police and the military, have in the US context and perhaps everywhere else a sense of their own sovereign right to inflict harm or extract freedom from people in their domain. So there are all these petit sovereigns, as it were, who get to do what they do. In her writing on El Salvador, the late, great Joan Didion talks about the inconsolable anger on the part of the forces of organized violence when they encounter political and cultural criticism of the things that they do. I think that this is really true in the United States today: people who, having worked their way up through police forces, are now the heads of municipal states - Lori Lightfoot in Chicago, Eric Adams in New York, and so forth - exhibit inconsolable anger that they're having become cops was not enough for all of us who criticize them. And then they deploy more cop work. They are insisting, like absolutist monarchs of the eighteenth century, that they must be respected and that they can get respect by doing whatever bodily reconfiguration of your person that they and their forces of organized violence wish to do. That's where I think we are.\n\nYour response brings to mind this visceral attachment to police and anger over any sort of questioning police legitimacy that makes Blue Lives Matter so core to today's right-wing politics. Ruthie, riffing off Stuart Hall, you write, \"Racism is the modality through which political-economic globalization is felt.\" So, mass incarceration, this ultimate fixing of large numbers of people in place, is key to understanding the forms of capitalism that have been ascendant since the 1970s or so. We've seen the same thing with the hardening of national borders. Border militarization, mass incarceration - it's all part of this \"deepening divide between the hyper-mobile and the friction-fixed.\" What is the historical relationship between increasing mobility for capital and growing control over the movement of people, whether in prisons or between nation-states?\n\nThis is something we should all talk about, because that relationship differs a lot in different places. And as Brenna and Alberto and I have been indicating, it's not as though what we see working is some kind of mechanistic functional system in which the economic imperative produces a certain output. It's not a machine, though it feels like a machine sometimes, because it's so big and noisy. So the movement of capital has gotten freer and free and freer. And the relative immobility of labor in the North American context - by which I mean the United States, Canada, and Mexico, not all of North America - has been in part a way for the capitalist firms that pass their goods through these three countries to maximize what they can extract from workers. I mean, that's clearly what the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was about, and it's what the new form of NAFTA seems still to be about.\n\nNow, if we step out of the United States for a moment and think about other places that are also characterized by remarkable inequality, we can see in India - a vast, complicated political economy, with urban, rural, and manufacturing sectors and so forth - that on top of many other conflicts and contradictions, people from Assam have been officially relegated to second-class status. Many people from Assam travel to other states of India to work, in agriculture or on the waterfront. The Dominican Republic has diminished the citizenship status of the descendants of Haitians, a people on the same island. And so Haitian Dominicans are second-class citizens in the Dominican Republic. The UK has been deporting people to many places but particularly to Jamaica, in constant purges. But what are these purges for? Is it to secure the labor force they want? Is it to secure a certain kind of provisional legitimacy, as the rapacious capitalist firms suck money and resources from people's pockets, through the state, and into their coffers? In the UK case, this extraction has taken place via private prisons and test-and-trace apps, through which cronies of the current UK government have amassed billions of pounds of revenue. In South Africa, the high levels of un- and underemployment - resulting in the constant movement of people closer to where money wages can be earned - means that the cities have grown way more rapidly than the cities have had the capacity to build and provide infrastructure and services. And the self-built communities around Durban, Cape Town, Joburg, and elsewhere have become sites of self-organization but also sites of struggle with very intense policing. At the same time, I'm told by people whose analysis I trust that the level of xenophobic violence in South Africa is rising again because the cost of bread is rising again. So it's anti-immigrant in the United States, anti-immigrant in India, anti-immigrant in South Africa, and anti-immigrant in the UK, and in Brazil there's a lot of struggle around the same kinds of issues. All these places have deep inequality and have high levels of mass incarceration, although nobody is remotely close in terms of the incarceration rate to the United States.\n\nDo you see a connection between, on the one hand, the declining legitimacy of the global economic order and the liberal internationalist world order and, on the other hand, this increasingly intense debate over the prison-industrial complex and immigration? For such a long time, and particularly in the '90s, mass incarceration, immigration control, and neoliberal globalization were taken to be almost natural norms - not that they weren't criticized by some.\n\nA real challenge for understanding the legitimacy crisis, and particularly the way it's articulated by movements of the so-called populist right, is the classic issue of the link between racism, race, racialization, forms of exploitation, and forms of capitalism. I remember reading a few years ago Peter Fryer's book Staying Power: A History of Black People in Britain . It has three chapters on riots; two of them concern returning white English soldiers from World War I and World War II. These soldiers were previously employed as dockworkers, but their dock work had been supplemented by workers from, broadly speaking, the Commonwealth, who had either migrated for those jobs or shifted from other jobs to those. In Liverpool, a large proportion of these workers were Yemenis; in Bristol, there were other groups as well. There's also a chapter, of course, about the Notting Hill riots in the '50s, which raise issues around the racialization of housing and the structure of urban space.\n\nSo, that gives us a sense of how mutable the points of condensation for far-right mobilization are. Indeed, it was some of the dockers, not to besmirch the entire category, who came out in defense of Enoch Powell right after the \"Rivers of Blood\" speech and in the late '60s as well. It's striking that in the present-day UK, the removal of the right to labor from Bulgarian, Polish, and Romanian workers, as well as the so-called Windrush generation, was perceived by many as a very peculiarly irrational operation, because it was driven by the tabloid \"British Jobs for British Workers\" slogan (a phrase that, alas, Gordon Brown also pronounced at one point). But when those Bulgarian and Romanian workers were removed or left because the situation was so dire, they were not replaced by those famous British workers; it wasn't the Tommies returning to work on the docks. This struggle over the racialized working site was very superstructural, the result of a fantasy about what work and class mean in Britain.\n\nSo I think that was very striking, as was the bewildering failure of vast swathes of progressive people to look at people's passports when they did their class analysis, which became a reflex for so many. All of those cliches about working-class voter rebellions did not include many of the people who pack salads, work in fields, and man logistical centers in the term \"working class.\" That has also been a striking element of the imaginative geographies and identifications that go along with class, that make these phenomena difficult to talk about and organize around in any remotely emancipatory sense. In other domains, there have been at least slivers of a better politics. I'm thinking, for instance, of some of the strikes around logistical work in Italy, which had migrant and nonwhite workers completely at their center for some time.\n\nI'm going to start from where Alberto just left off, talking about the logistical strikes. We need to think really hard about the people who, during the pandemic, were greeted with applause and pot-banging, the essential workers who at great peril to themselves went out and brought us our salads or who went to the hospital without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) to care for people who were sick and dying and suffering.\n\nOver the last couple of years, I've been following the fact that one of the biggest unions in the United States is National Nurses United. And the nurses are quite a formidable group of people whose political education over the last two years has compelled them to agree to a really remarkable set of resolutions at their convention this past January. They talked about what is happening with the circulation of what I call the social wage: What's happened to public budgets over time? They have demanded nonstop free universal health care for all. They have stepped up in opposition to immigrant control. Many people who work in nursing in the United States are themselves long-distance migrants, probably in most cases with adequate documentation to be able to come and go as they like. But there is a political understanding of the experience of long-distance migration that matters. It's not just that they're migrants; it's that they have developed a political understanding in the context of struggling face-to-face with suffering people in hospitals.\n\nMeanwhile, nurses, like people who work for Amazon or Starbucks, are employed by these incredibly enormous multinational corporations. And yet they are constrained to fight worksite by worksite. So they have an understanding of the dilemmas of both big capital and of the neoliberal imperatives that have been forcing down wages and disrupting the close relations some smaller firms might have had with the communities where people live and work. There is this abstract enemy called \"Hospital Corporation of America\"; there is this constant movement through this desakota space, between the Philippines and the United States, or Liberia and the United States, or Sierra Leone and the United States, or Jamaica and the United States. I don't ever purport to know what home means to anybody, and having multiple homes is not all that uncommon for working people - but wherever home is for these workers, obviously there's some kind of disruption that has compelled the movement of people from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Jamaica, and the Philippines to the United States or to the Gulf or wherever they work and send remittances home. The fact of these remittances, then, gives an additional insight in itself.\n\nSo all of these dynamics that the nurse and their political education formation have been thinking about enable people to think internationalism from the ground up. I want to give one other example, and that is the work that for now almost forty years the Landless Workers' Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, MST) has been doing in Brazil, again from the ground up: land occupations, establishment of villages, and establishment of schools, as well as sending teams out around the world to work with people, including in the self-built communities of South Africa, Indonesia, and wherever else. They work with people to figure out how to make whatever soil and agricultural capacity they have flourish. There is also an entire urban dimension of late, struggling around food insecurity or food apartheid or nutritional insecurity in the cities of Brazil, both in very overbuilt areas as well as in the self-built hillside favelas; they also work in solidarity with long-distance migrants who pass through Brazil, heading often to the United States and Canada, who are vulnerable to being entrapped by the various police forces of the countries they'll pass through, which have contracts with the US to prevent people's movements.\n\nIf all that adds up to a legitimacy crisis for neoliberalism, I applaud that view. And I think it's incumbent on us to think as closely as we can about the various spectacular events of the last couple of years. Not only did US cities go up in flames for a while, but there were also events like that incredible general strike in India; a quarter of a billion people put their tools down, which tells us there's all this other organizing going on, because that doesn't happen spontaneously. So I think there is a significant legitimacy crisis. I think that the forces of organized violence for the overdeveloped world are busy positioning their troops around the world, whether it's in Somalia or closer and closer to the Ukraine border. The question of what sovereignty means is fundamental to what we're trying to figure out. And yet I don't feel the kind of overwhelming despair that some of the things I write about suggest I should feel, because everything I write is in order for us to figure out how to organize.\n\nWhen I was thinking about the question you put to Ruthie about the legitimacy crisis of neoliberalism or mass incarceration, I thought, well, you're asserting as self-evident that there is a legitimacy crisis. After listening to what Ruthie just said, I guess it's something that I'd like to think further about, because from where I'm sitting, it doesn't feel like there is a legitimacy crisis exactly. Given the moment that we're in with the climate emergency, you would think that there would be a much more virulent legitimacy crisis when it comes to neoliberalism, mass incarceration, and everything else you mentioned. But it's just not what it looks like from where I'm sitting. When we think about questions of sovereignty, of course, I'm in British Columbia, and I'm sitting on Musqueam land right now. The struggles in this place are really ones of asserting different jurisdictions: assertions of indigenous jurisdiction over their lands coming up against a state-capital nexus and a legal apparatus that insists on reducing these jurisdictional confrontations and battles down to real-estate matters and property disputes.\n\nThe other place where I'm sitting is as a legal scholar. So in thinking about the legal structures that underlie neoliberalism and neoliberal legality, what I see is a system that makes it much more difficult to identify points of opposition, which is something Ruthie was talking about earlier. We can think about neoliberal legality as parasitic on the kinds of liberal legalism that we're all accustomed to critiquing, and we can deconstruct liberal legalism in our sleep. But neoliberal legality also operates in a very different way, I think, to make it extremely difficult to find a point of genuine opposition. To give a more concrete example of what I mean, if we think about financialization and housing, neoliberal relations of work have made it extremely difficult for people even to find the time to organize. This is very different from the world that I was familiar with as a young person, even twenty years ago. I think that neoliberalism and the legal apparatus that gives it a material life have created a situation where the whole idea of the legitimacy crisis needs to be reframed or rethought, in terms of the question of: Where do we see modes of resistance and confrontation that are adequate to the way that neoliberalism works?\n\nI think we see the once very naturalized bipartisan politics behind neoliberalism, mass incarceration, and border enforcement breaking down because of declining legitimacy in the eyes of both a radicalizing left and a radicalizing right. But I agree that we're not at a full crisis point yet. Instead, we're in some sort of long interregnum where it seems like everyone has lost faith, but people aren't angry or organized enough to make a massive systemic change, either for the better or, in the case of the Right's disillusionment, very much for the worse.\n\nI wonder, though, if we could divide or multiply even the notion of crisis of legitimacy. Brenna pointed out that the legitimacy of the state has never been recognized by people whose lands were taken and occupied, and we can extend that to the vast swathes of social life where people never felt that domination over them or the extraction of their wages by the state and its minions had any particular legitimacy. I remember some great passages from these letters that the Italian communist Maria Antonietta Macciocchi sent to Louis Althusser as he was in the depths of silent depression during May '68. She was campaigning in the so-called subproletarian neighborhoods of Naples, and she writes wonderfully about the completely ironic and distant and instrumental relationship that the Neapolitans she was talking to had with legality as such and with the state; these were at best things to be tolerated, perhaps things to be undermined or manipulated if need be, or to be negotiated with monetarily or otherwise. These people were never actually interpolated as citizen-subjects - that just was not the game they were in. And so I wonder, for whom has there been legitimacy and for whom has it entered into crisis?\n\nFor a resurgent, intensified, and recombining radical far right - certainly in settler colonial contexts, which have their specific forms of fascization - this crisis is a matter of re-empowering a racialized form of petty sovereignty: the constitutional sheriffs' movements in the States, these bizarre forms of dual power that leverage the Republican Party for extremely militarized forms of local politics. In the Italian case, you have patriotic occupations done by far-right groups who take over apartment buildings in Rome for unemployed people with Italian passports but who also go out and attack migrants. They have very different relationships to legitimacy. I think there's a risk to seeing the crisis of legitimacy through the lens of electoral disaffection or disaffiliation with the systems of representation. Of course, this trend is extremely significant and needs to be thought about and dealt with, but I think there are other layers. We should also distinguish between people who are nostalgic for a legitimacy that they imagine once existed and people who never necessarily felt themselves to be interpolated by the state as citizens. Perhaps this latter group had a less violent, exclusionary, and depressing relationship to state institutions in the past than they do now, or perhaps they found room to breathe and lived in a way that is now disappearing. That's not to say that the notion of a legitimacy crisis and of an interregnum you mentioned is not useful or pertinent, because I very much think it is. But I think we need to divide that notion of legitimacy and think about how it's experienced and lived for different people.\n\nI mean, we can also see this crisis in the United States, not just in representative political institutions but also in the workplace: the campaigns to unionize Starbucks and Amazon are two inspiring examples.\n\nIn the US, we have lived through the reconfiguration of the territorial extent of all kinds of remedies for perceived diminution of rights. That's a wordy way of saying that however much the federal state of the United States generalized territorially expansive protections for vulnerable people, that is going away, and it's going away very deliberately. State legislators and governors, who are seeing this fragmentation of the territory of rights, are aiding it because they, of course, have embraced the notion of a legitimacy crisis and have organized themselves and have acted to reconfigure the world in a way that brings back the rules that they think should be in place. I mean, this is what Laura Ingraham says.\n\nBut I want to connect this to what Brenna was talking about, concerning how many people in Canada and in unceded lands around the planet are persistently invited to embrace the notion that the way to resolve contestation over land is for the land to become private property. This is happening in British Columbia, and it's happening in Jamaica - it's happening all over the place. It's not happening evenly, but it's certainly happening. One of the effects of this incorporation of people who are contesting dispossession is that their incorporation then strengthens rather than weakens what we're calling neoliberalism (although 90 percent of the time, I'm not really sure what I mean when I say that word). Part of this incorporation, in my view, appeals to people's notion of themselves as beings who bear culture with them. So if we are bearing our indigenous culture, and if we have this land as property, then we can perform our culture. I don't mean to do a dance for an audience; I mean be. This appeal to culture also helps us understand the various dimensions of how the strong executive - and I really mean the iron-fist executive - is presented as the remedy for problems that one imagines in a democratic setting would be slugged out in democratic assemblies.\n\nI'm going to give an example, which is going to sound far from the example of the privatization of unceded land. In the city of New York, there's an ongoing crisis over the city jails. Famously, Rikers Island, which has been a penal colony for many decades, has been roundly condemned politically: people die there all the time and so forth. The former mayor of New York proposed building four new jails, dotting them around the boroughs, and spending $11 billion of borrowed money so that these jails could somehow fulfill the promise of actual \"enlightened correction.\" And of course, we abolitionists have been against this. Well, there's a new round of activity in the city of New York now around the issue of where a new jail for \"women and gender-expansive people\" should be and how it should be run. The people who have proposed this new jail, different from the four new jails that the former mayor wanted to build, say, \"Our jail is not really going to be a jail.\" The perimeter will be secured by cops, by correction officers - but the people who work inside will not be prison employees. It's going to be run by a not-for-profit.\n\nBut in order to achieve this spectacularly wonderful new lockup for women and gender-expansive people, the City of New York, which is one of the most densely unionized public formations in the United States, is going to have to break the union contract with the prison guards. Now, in order for the city to break this contract, necessarily a new decision-making body has got to slide into the already existing complexity of a city that's composed of five different counties; and above those five different counties, it has to be able to hire, reprimand, and fire anybody. So we have the strongest imaginable executive, who will then lift the problem of prison well-being and prison rehabilitation for women and gender-expansive people out of the realm of politics; this executive puts it in the realm of quote-unquote \"culture,\" to be run by technocrats.\n\nThis is the word they keep using: \"culture.\" In the context of everything we've been talking about, we can see in this story of New York both the neoliberal legitimacy crisis and the neoliberal resolution to the legitimacy crisis. And as Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò says in his new book, Elite Capture , there are countless people who are pushed to the front of the stage in every discussion, who once were locked in the hellhole that is Rikers and who say, \"Yes, I want this new prison.\" But we never explored the question of why we expect that they or anybody else should go or go back to prison. That's not even a possible agenda, any more than there was a possibility, in the case Brenna brought up, of seriously discussing actual land back rather than privatizing some bits of unceded territory.\n\nRuthie, you write:\n\nThe key point is this: at any scale, racism is not a lagging indicator, an anachronistic drag on an otherwise achievable social equality guaranteed by the impersonal freedom of expanding markets. History is not a long march from premodern racism to postmodern pluralism. Rather, racism's changing same does triple duty: claims of natural or cultura l incommensurability secure conditions for reproducing economic inequalities, which then validate theories of extra-economic hierarchical difference.\n\nElsewhere, you write:\n\nThe state's management of racial categories is analogous to the management of highways or ports or telecommunication; racist ideological and material practices are infrastructure that needs to be updated, upgraded, and modernized periodically: this is what is meant by racialization. And the state itself, not just interests or forces external to the state, is built and enhanced through these practices. Sometimes these practices result in \"protecting\" certain racial groups and other times they result in sacrificing them.\n\nThis notion of racism as a \"changing same\" reminded me of a few things. First, it reminded me of Joe Lowndes and Daniel Martinez HoSang's work in their book, Producers, Parasites, Patriots . They point, in particular, to how frameworks developed to stigmatize black women welfare recipients as parasitic on the productive taxpayer were redeployed in the Tea Party era against unionized public employees. Your idea also made me think about Donald Trump's growing support from Latino and even black voters in 2020. How do you see racism and racial formations mutating today and to what end do they appear to be mutating?\n\nOne example that many people talk about in the context not only of the United States but also Western Europe is the quote-unquote \"racialization\" of Muslims, who themselves might check - if they live in a place that has categories to check, which many people don't - any range of more old-fashioned racial and ethnic identifiers. That's an example, but it's not the only one. Alberto and Brenna, you lived through this and probably thought about it a lot - in the buildup to Brexit, it was pretty striking, as I've learned from my friend Ben Rogaly and others, how, for example, Polish workers were constantly harassed, as the date for Brexit drew near, by people saying, \"At last you're going to leave and go home.\"\n\nThere are many different ways of answering that question, most certainly. But a couple of things come to mind for me, and they relate back to several of the themes we've talked about. One is the idea of the petty sovereign and how racial violence is currently playing out. I wanted to add to the framework that Ruthie elaborated when she was discussing the proliferation of police organizing and that kind of police work: the framework of settler colonialism. Both historically and in the current moment, the figure of the petty sovereign has retained a very important place in the formation of settler colonial states. This is not the typical figure we associate with the term \"sovereignty\" - the police, the administrator, the jail-keeper, or the bailiff - it's actually citizens who fall into a long-established racial kinship with the sovereign state. Settler violence has always relied on blurring the line between the police, who have the monopoly of violence, and the petty sovereign citizen-subject, who doesn't have a monopoly of violence but is certainly enabled by the state to enact all kinds of lethal racial violence. We can think about how this figure is manifesting in this particular moment of rising authoritarianism and white nationalism.\n\nConsider the Freedom Convoy in Canada that lasted several months. People referred to it disparagingly as the \"clown-voy,\" but we saw the police in Ottawa almost give it their blessing. When you listen to the interviews with the police about the convoy protesters, it was as if they were talking about their kin, like their sons or their cousins; there was this kind of under-level, implicit understanding. Now, I'm generalizing, of course, but that was definitely present. Another example that comes to mind is Israel-Palestine, where much settlement activity and displacement and dispossession also happens through the figure of the petty sovereign, who is not a member of the military or the police state. These are private petty sovereigns, you could say. I think of Palestine because I'm also concerned about how racialization and anti-Palestinian or anti-Arab racism is mutating today, into a form where racialized people who are not Palestinian face racism because of their support for Palestinian rights. How do we think about that form of racism in this current moment? Maybe there is a legitimacy crisis when it comes to Israel's apartheid practices, and maybe this is a response to that.\n\nForms of racism and racialization can certainly mutate in response to a crisis. Many of my examples have been instances where there is a crisis. In the Canadian context, that crisis has been produced by the pandemic and also the recent rise in at least the discourse of reconciliation around indigenous rights and indigenous sovereignty. In the Israel-Palestine context, you also see a growing global consensus that the State of Israel is engaging in apartheid practices, with mainstream human rights organizations finally backing up what Palestinians and others have been saying for decades. And that is producing a virulent reaction, which incorporates particular processes of racialization, namely the one that I just mentioned.\n\nWhat about the strange situation where people that we certainly think of as racialized, like Hispanics in the lower Rio Grande Valley, are swinging hard to the right? They're not only swinging hard to the right politically but really seeing themselves reflected in MAGA America.\n\nThe first answer to your question, Daniel, is to reconsider the phrase \"think of as racialized.\" The dynamics are far less direct and predictable than we who have gotten into the habit of speaking in collective generalizations, for good reason, tend to assume. The \"race\" in \"racial capitalism\" isn't an epiphenomenon, and yet it's still a fiction. People take to the streets because of its real effects. But that means they take to the streets to undo real effects in order to embrace some other possible effects in their lives.\n\nAnd so it doesn't surprise me to think, oh, people in the Rio Grande Valley, who we might have assumed would cast their electoral ballots on the side of greater opportunity and protection for quote-unquote \"people of color,\" didn't vote that way. It doesn't surprise me any more than the fact that so many people of African descent in the United States believe that their path and their community's path to well-being and security is to become cops. They know all the stories about cops, but they become cops. I don't see that as any more surprising than people in the Rio Grande Valley voting for Trump.\n\nEric Adams got beaten up by cops as a teenager.\n\nAnd that made him a cop. I think the reason that many people stub their analytical toes on racial capitalism is that they think that the categories must be fixed rather than realizing that the whole genius of capitalism is that it changes all the time. The meaning of \"racial\" is part of this change. You can't have capitalism without people; you can't have capitalism without inequality; you can't have capitalism without the system constantly going into crisis, which means we cannot have capitalism without capitalism saving capitalism from capitalism. And it's in this dynamic that we see these relationships, identities, and assertions emerge, consolidate, and perhaps fracture again.\n\nSome of us have been talking recently in a desultory way about how terrific it would be if the huge anti-capitalist, anti-colonial, anti-imperial category \"political blackness\" came back into being. It would have to have meaning to go forward into being. But the kinds of fragmentation and categorical fixity that so many people, especially in the US context, project onto people are probably what's in the way of such an all-embracing category to start moving as the specter of our time. But it seems to me there ought to be something that can do the work of suturing categories so that the possibility of solidarity, rather than alliance, becomes more meaningful to people as they try to understand what's going on in the world.\n\nYeah, it takes us back to that concept of the \"changing same.\" If race is the constant apologia for the changing capitalist system and its changing forms of inequality, then we shouldn't be so surprised that race and racism are always changing too - and that if we want to make major political-economic change, that's going to require articulating new forms of identity.\n\nI'd like to go back to the two cases that Ruthie was talking about, namely the racialization of, to use an improper term, \"phenotypically white\" Europeans and the question of Islam. While working on a book about the contemporary afterlives of fascism, I reread some of Robinson's work. He uses the optic of racial capitalism to counter what he sees as these \"manicured genealogies\" of fascism produced by Western intellectuals throughout the twentieth century. And he very strikingly says that there are two distinct and concealed cultural articulations that lie behind modern racism. One is the intra-European and therefore retroactively but totally anachronistically intrawhite, articulation of conquest, dispossession, and depredation along racialized tribal or group axes. The other is Europe's encounter with its Islamic other. It would be obviously very methodologically inaccurate to say these two elements return in any direct sense, but it's striking that those are seen as the material bases for racial capitalism - that it is not born in the transatlantic slave trade, contrary to what, bizarrely, a lot of people still think Robinson said.\n\nBut let's leave that aside and go back to the point that you raised earlier, regarding the material and infrastructural character of the work that race does: the constant repair of its failing infrastructure or the need to kind of recombine it. In that same passage, Robinson says that racial discourses are there to normalize the abundant and frequently destabilized systems of domination and subordination. And so, in one sense, it's the destabilization and the various vectors of destabilization that need to be attended to, analytically or militantly or prescriptively, to think through these questions.\n\nAbolition is sometimes heralded as a position of intransigence. It is the stubborn insistence that the entirety of the prison-industrial complex and the whole social order that requires it is beyond reform or repair. As you write in the book, such an insight \"makes people impatient,\" as it well should. And yet the sort of struggles and demands that your organizing has advanced and that you celebrate throughout the book are not the stuff of an immediate total rupture with prisons and police. What's more, the capacious picture of abolition that you paint for us seems to move at a slower pace than a single revolutionary event or some sort of decree that prisons and police batons shall all be traded in for plowshares. How should we relate this abolitionist maximalism to the longer arc of social transformation that it might require? And what does that mean for how we think about what revolution means?\n\nThat's a great question. I was just reading China Miéville's new book on the Communist Manifesto . He actually takes up the debate Western Marxists such as Perry Anderson and Marshall Berman had about what a revolution is. And of course Anderson says that revolution is a very specific thing: it's a change of government from below. Otherwise, it's just a metaphor. Discussion ensued. Well, here's what I think. I think that if living life for the purpose of changing how we live life takes a long time, so be it. We who think about abolition and try our best to explain its universal remit have attempted to show that there are certain kinds of changes that reorganize what already is, like resolving problems of unceded territory with privatization of property or electing police officers to preside over the capital of capitalism in New York. The longue durée is not the purpose, but it ought not be surprising at all. We're all here looking at each other because of events that began in, more or less, 1451. So it's not as though we're stuck in a series of events and reconfigurations of recent occurrence that we must quickly and swiftly undo.\n\nNow, further, anybody who imagines that the forces of organized violence in the United States or Western Europe could be toppled tomorrow if only abolitionists were more impatient would have to show me a plan of action - because I don't think that can happen. And yet making the world we want, which people are doing in so many different ways, brings together, I think, at least three pretty powerful strands of human self-organization. At least one of those strands is communism: small \"c\" communism, sometimes realized through big \"C\" Communist parties. Another strand is the kind of serious anarchism that produces strong and vibrant self-organized communities. And the third I'd name, perhaps unpopularly, are liberation faith movements of a wide variety of types: not necessarily monotheistic but not necessarily not monotheistic either. These strands just keep coming together and forming the possibility for groups like the MST to do what they do. That to me is what abolition should be; it's a normative claim. Abolition isn't a party; it's a way of thinking about the world that then gives us the ability to see what people already do and figure out how to make more of that happen.\n\nThere's a kind of historical irony because the language that most people on the Left use to talk about revolution was, of course, forged at the time when abolitionism - calling itself \"abolitionism,\" not gradualist but \"immediatist\" abolitionism - was so critical to scholar-activists of the mid-nineteenth century. Marx, writing for the New York Daily Tribune , just uses one of his articles to reproduce a speech by Wendell Phillips on the liberation of enslaved people in the West Indies, for instance. What's more, all these often-tiresome scholarly debates about Marx and G.W.F. Hegel are quickly resolved once one sees that Marx uses a term from Hegel, \" Aufheben ,\" which is often seen as a conservationist or reconciling notion, but which is the same term used to talk about the abolition of slavery. Marx links the abolition of slavery directly to the abolition of private property and the abolition of all sorts of other interlinked institutions. And of course, he and myriad activists and thinkers from all wings of the international working people's movements face these issues for one hundred and some more years.\n\nThe question that you pose is also the practical question of transition, right? What do we do with our banks? What do we do with our highways? Or indeed, very significantly, what do we do with an entire material world and system of social relations that have been generated by and are reproduced by and enhance the devastation of our planet through fossil fuel consumption? The form of the problem you just raised about prisons is analogous to the form of questions about other dimensions of contemporary capital society.\n\nOf course, those dimensions have different materialities and different temporalities and also interlink with each other in all sorts of ways. But the problem, I think, still concerns not just what we intend by revolution within this network of ideas and experiences and histories but also what exactly those nonreformist reforms would look like. And already in that formulation by André Gorz in the late '50s, those nonreformist reforms are not just judged by their consequences or by how they fit into a broader strategy. They're judged by the fact that the people concerned are directly, in a collective or mass sense, involved in them. So l think it's crucial that we don't take a view about what would count as revolutionary in terms of its effects, without thinking about the problems of transforming everyday life and experience; we need to make the kind of collectives that can engage in revolutionary or communist or abolitionist politics.\n\nThe ways in which Ruthie maps solidarity in a variety of concrete, seemingly local, but actually international struggles throughout the book are exemplary in thinking about what that would look like. What would it look like for seemingly fragmented, seemingly disparate people to come together in determinate places to engage in processes of dismantling that are also processes of building something else?\n\nYou just said that my question about the immediacy of abolitionist demands and the longue durée of struggle echoes these fundamental, long-standing questions about the transition to communism. And relatedly, one might be forgiven for thinking that abolition might be another way to talk about communism. Why do we speak of abolition, then? Why not just communism?\n\nSo many of the people who joined together in the '90s to launch the contemporary abolition movement came out of communist formations. I've never really talked with my comrades about this, but I imagine one reason for the distinction was that many people are really deaf to the word \"communism.\" Theorists have remarked on the existence of anti-communism without communists. Anti-communism continues to be so lively in the United States; many people, as was the case in the past, would rapidly embrace all the aspects of communism they might learn about, but only if somebody told them these ideas without using the \"c\" word (although I do have hope that younger folks today are becoming enthusiastically curious about what communism is). So those are a couple of the whys: that people turn a deaf ear and that people think they know what communism is and therefore stop listening because this is not what they want.\n\nI appreciated Ruthie's point about 1451, but we also have to think about places like British Columbia, which only joined the Canadian Confederation in 1871 and began to form as a province maybe ten years before that. This is a province that's at the extreme end of extractivism and a kind of terra nullius settler colonialism and is also experiencing climate change at an extreme rate. So there's also sometimes a feeling - as we acknowledge that we're on unceded land and call into question the legitimacy of colonial sovereignty and private property relations - that, yeah, maybe it's old, but there are moments where there's a possibility of unsettling this history. And these moments are only happening now because of a long arc of struggle and resistance.\n\nFor me, thinking about abolition is helpful and generative because it holds these different temporalities together; that's absolutely vital for thinking about how change happens and how we make change. I'm not thinking about something as lofty as revolution but just transformation - radical transformation, let's say, to get away from the Perry Anderson baggage of thinking about revolution. So, I think that's one advantage of thinking through the concept of abolition and the practices of abolition. Again, it holds together different temporalities, and it also holds together the conceptual, abstract domain and the everyday. Organizing can be unglamorous and tedious; it involves a lot of communicating with one another and all kinds of difficult work. Abolition is a capacious political idea and practice that is incredibly generative.\n\nRuth Wilson Gilmore is professor of earth and environmental sciences and American studies at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, where she is also director of the Center for Place, Culture, and Politics.

But instead of actually funding the police, the alleged fraudster behind the scam is pocketing millions.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department's 10th District, on July 7, 2023.

He knows your name and gives his name, too. After establishing a rapport, perhaps with a joke, he tugs at your heartstrings - and purse strings - for causes like veterans funds, help for families of slain police officers, and first-responder support associations. Can you donate?\n\nMatthew Perri, a thirty-one-year-old server from South Elgin, Illinois, gave roughly $500 to Honoring American Law Enforcement after receiving such a call in May. But instead of going to police, most of his money likely ended up in the swelling coffers of a notorious Las Vegas telemarketing king behind bars for fraud.\n\n\"I had no idea about that, and I'm very upset,\" Perri said, only realizing the group was questionable after the Lever contacted him about his donations. \"Oh my gosh, I've been scammed.\"\n\nAs crime and violence have become major election-year issues - Perri, a registered Republican, called the news of Donald Trump's attempted assassination \"very concerning\" - the Lever has found that a shadowy network of potentially counterfeit political action committees with names like Honoring American Law Enforcement, Law Enforcement for a Safer America, and Police Coalition of America has raised more than $14 million from pro-police calls and funneled roughly half of that to vendors connected to Richard Zeitlin , a telemarketer arrested last year on federal charges for wire fraud and obstruction of justice.\n\nAnd while Zeitlin has been behind bars awaiting trial on these charges for nearly a year, those companies and political action committees have continued to bring in money - all while Congress refuses to act.\n\nThe vendors - Standard Data Services , Wired4data , LAV Services , and Cloud Data Services - have received almost $13 million from all political action committees this election cycle. While the federal indictment against Zeitlin kept his business network anonymous, these four companies were identified through reviews of court documents, state business licenses, past reporting, and Federal Election Commission records.\n\nZeitlin is currently incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, while the criminal case is ongoing. A federal judge twice denied him bail , deeming him a flight risk because he has partial ownership of a private plane, properties in Mexico, and recently obtained foreign citizenship in Israel. His colleague Robert Piaro , who ran multiple political action committees that gave money to Zeitlin's companies, was released on bail after his arrest last year in Wisconsin and was last scheduled to appear before a federal court in May. Several of Piaro's committees remained active as of fall 2023, though none were related to law enforcement.\n\nAccording to Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at Columbia Law School in New York, Zeitlin's companies remain active because the criminal case is still pending, which is typical for federal wire fraud cases like this.\n\n\"A conviction would make civil/enforcement action against the companies quick and easy,\" said Richman in an email. The Department of Justice requires a conviction for criminal forfeiture.\n\nThe indictment against Zeitlin alleges that his telemarketing firms operating on the behalf of political action committees misled people to believe their money would be going toward charitable causes, but instead Zeitlin and his associates were pocketing much of the cash. In 2021, calls requesting donations for law enforcement made up the largest share of all scam calls nationwide tracked by Nomorobo, a robocall-blocking service.\n\nSince the overwhelming majority of this money went toward overhead costs and hardly any ended up supporting political candidates, experts say these fundraising efforts display all the hallmarks of scam political action committees, which claim to raise money for political causes but pocket nearly all the funds themselves. These scam committees often use networks of the same vendors to help disguise where their money is going.\n\nThere is no official definition for a scam political action committee, but there are generally two criteria. First, these groups may promise to raise money for a certain candidate or cause but actually spend most of their money on overhead costs like fundraising or administration. Second, they direct money to networks of fraudulent vendors associated with those in charge of the committees. These scam operations are also not endorsed by official candidates, political parties, or reputable nonprofit or corporate organizations.\n\nMisrepresenting where political action committee money is illegal under existing wire fraud and campaign finance laws. But it's not illegal for these committee operators to enrich themselves through spending money on salaries or linked vendors instead of campaigns.\n\nZeitlin's indictment claimed he switched the focus of his telemarketing schemes from charities to political action committees around 2017 to avoid regulations and requirements that do not apply to tax-exempt political organizations. For instance, unlike charities, political action committees do not have to register with states, provide information about their top employees, or detail how their money is spent.\n\nExperts warn that record-breaking election spending has led to a proliferation of scam committees.\n\nWhile some lawmakers have introduced legislation and called for increased oversight of scam political action committees since Zeitlin's activities first came to light, these efforts haven't produced any new regulatory actions.\n\nMoreover, Republicans have moved to install members of the Federal Election Commission who are opposed to enforcement , hamstringing the agency's ability to investigate campaign finance crimes.\n\nProject 2025 , the proposed policy platform for a second Trump presidency, calls for a restrained approach to election oversight. The chapter on the Federal Election Commission was written by Hans von Spakovsky, an election security alarmist whom the Senate denied confirming as an election commissioner in the mid-2000s after Justice Department staff accused him of injecting \"partisan political factors into decision-making on enforcement matters.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment on scam political action committees, the Federal Election Commission referenced its most recent legislative recommendations from December 2023, which asked Congress to crack down on payments to vendors with a financial relationship to political action committee operators among other proposed reforms. The agency declined to comment on specific cases when asked about the allegations against Zeitlin.\n\nWhen asked for comment, the Department of Justice declined to provide information other than what has already been made public about its case against Zeitlin.\n\nZeitlin's career in telemarketing began when he founded the Las Vegas, Nevada-based Courtesy Call in 1994. According to the federal indictment, his call centers have since brought in hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nLegal cases against Zeitlin-owned companies and linked pro-police groups stretch back over fifteen years. In 2009, the California attorney general sued Courtesy Call, along with its client, the Association for Police and Sheriffs, for allegedly deceiving and misleading donors. Courtesy Call settled the case by paying a $17,000 fine but did not admit wrongdoing.\n\nIn 2018, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Courtesy Call and another Zeitlin company, Donor Relations, for alleged \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" such as calling numbers on the Do Not Call list. According to regulators, Zeitlin refused to cooperate by providing late and inaccurate documents, and the agency ended up dropping its case .\n\nDespite multiple government agencies investigating Zeitlin, his companies received between $500,000 to $1.3 million in government loans as part of a 2020 COVID-19 stimulus program.\n\nIn 2021, Zeitlin faced a class-action lawsuit from several political donors about their donations to three pro-police organizations. That suit was still ongoing when the FBI arrested Zeitlin at his home in Las Vegas last August. Federal prosecutors charged him with conspiring and committing wire fraud and obstruction of justice.\n\nPast reporting from the nonprofit news organization Center for Public Integrity found that Zeitlin's companies had received $133.1 million from political action committees between 2006 and 2019. Moreover, a Reuters investigation found that four of Zeitlin's firms made more than $27.6 million from the beginning of 2017 through mid-2019, making him the largest player in the $83.1 million network of questionable fundraising operations that contract with political action committees.\n\nZeitlin's companies have received less money since his arrest - but the funds are still coming in. Zeitlin's businesses have so far netted $13 million from all political action committees since January 1, 2023, compared to $20.5 million at this point in the 2022 election cycle.\n\nIn its indictment, the Justice Department named five pro-police political action committees that contracted with Zeitlin's businesses from 2017 to 2020. While four of them are now defunct, one is still in operation and another six operations have been doing business with Zeitlin this election cycle, resulting in seven pro-police political action committees funneling money to Zeitlin this election cycle.\n\nThese political action committees raised $14 million in total, mostly from small donors, between January 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024. While one committee raised just a few hundred dollars, the rest have raised amounts ranging from about $270,000 to $6.7 million. Another committee, Police Action Fund, which raised $220,000, did not have clear ties to Zeitlin but had spending patterns that suggested it was a scam committee.\n\nThe six Zeitlin-linked pro-police committees that raised substantive amounts of money this campaign cycle spent about 70 to 95 percent of their funds on fundraising alone. In contrast, less than 5 percent of their haul went toward political campaigns or ads for candidates.\n\nThe two largest of Zeitlin's companies receiving money from these fundraising committees, Wired4data and Cloud Data Services, were both named in the 2021 lawsuit but have continued operating, collecting $4.6 million from pro-police political action committees this election cycle. Reviews of state business records and Federal Election Commission records revealed two other Zeitlin-linked vendors doing business with these pro-police committees, LAV Services and Standard Data Services, which have together raised $2.3 million.\n\nFederal election records list two vendors linked to Zeitlin, Cloud Data Services and LAV Services, at the same address in Henderson, Nevada. LAV Services, Standard Data Services, and Wired4data are also all incorporated at the same address in Wilmington, Delaware, which doesn't require companies to disclose their owners.\n\nMany of the scam companies that contract with political action committees share the same address because they are run by the same people. The 2021 lawsuit also alleged that several of Zeitlin's companies, including Cloud Data Services, use mailboxes with mail forwarding services to disguise that they are being run from the same location.\n\nSeveral of the treasurers behind the committees are known Zeitlin associates. For instance, Support America's Police, which has paid Zeitlin's companies almost $970,000 this election cycle, is run by Oliver Cappleman , who has known Zeitlin for decades. Cappleman's political action committees, which also include ones claiming to support veterans, first responders, and children with autism, paid him a total of $187,527 this cycle, according to OpenSecrets .\n\nMatt Cobos, who was named in the 2021 class-action lawsuit as the treasurer for the now-defunct Zeitlin-linked political action committee Disabled Veterans Coalition, currently runs two committees, Police and Trooper Support and Patriots for Police, which have together raised almost $1.6 million this election cycle and paid $1.3 million to Zeitlin's businesses.\n\nMany of the people behind these organizations have legitimate connections to politics and police. Mike McCauley, who runs Citizens for Law Enforcement, the committee that did not do business with Zeitlin's companies but had similar spending patterns as the other political action committees, also served as the treasurer of the Utah Republican Party from 1999 to 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile . \"I don't have any response to that,\" McCauley said before hanging up when asked about the political action committee he runs.\n\nBob Stitt , a retired Ohio state trooper, is the treasurer of Honoring American Law Enforcement and a director for the International Union of Police Associations, an alleged scam charity tied to Zeitlin. Honoring American Law Enforcement has directed about $1.2 million toward Zeitlin's companies this election cycle. The International Union of Police Associations sent $9.2 million to Zeitlin's four companies in the year ending March 2023.\n\nWilliam Pollock , a former Las Vegas police officer, and his wife ran the Police Officers Defense Alliance, a defunct political action committee that did business with Zeitlin from 2018 to 2022, and several other Zeitlin-linked committees. In 2017, Pollock shot and killed a man wielding a butter knife .\n\nLawyers representing Zeitlin and Piaro did not respond to requests for comment. The other operators behind these groups did not respond or were not available to comment.\n\nCalls raising money for scam political action committees represent just a small fraction of the $30 to $40 billion phone scam industry. Charity scams claim to raise money directly for local law enforcement or other causes. The organizations they raise money for typically have official-sounding names like the American Police and Troopers Coalition and the International Union of Police Associations.\n\nThe calls asking for donations may come from overseas or anonymous offices in the United States but often spoof local area codes to make it seem like the people asking are based in the community. While Reuters identified a call center in Alabama run by another of Zeitlin's companies, TPFE, the court opinion denying him bail also claimed that Zeitlin has call centers in Guatemala and Panama.\n\nOften, the caller will have a deep, male voice that lends authority. But that call likely comes from a computer, as a prerecorded voice enables these telemarketers to communicate with multiple people at once. Operators use switchboards to issue different statements depending on the response, hoping to sway recalcitrant donors. The caller may become more and more insistent if the would-be victim remains on the line but does not donate.\n\nEngaging by talking to the callers - or worse, donating - increases the likelihood of receiving future calls. One journalist who donated to the National Police and Troopers Association, a \" special project \" from the Zeitlin-linked charity International Union of Police Associations, started receiving up to ten calls a day from various organizations claiming to represent law enforcement, firefighters, and veterans. While telemarketing calls are the most common way these scammers try to get people to donate, several local police departments have also issued warnings about scam solicitations sent by mail.\n\nAlleged scam pro-police committees often raise far more money than legitimate law enforcement political action committees, which have netted only about $650,000 this election cycle. In contrast, the groups suspected of telemarketing scams have raised $14.3 million in total - $14 million of which came from political action committees that contracted with Zeitlin.\n\nThis figure likely doesn't capture the full scope of pro-law enforcement fundraising scams. OpenSecrets, a government watchdog group that compiles and publishes election spending data, only tracks the hundred largest vendors in a given election cycle and the ten largest vendors for any given political action committee. Moreover, organizations other than political action committees, like scam charities and political nonprofits that are not regulated by the Federal Election Commission, are also known to raise money by falsely claiming to support police.\n\nIn fact, one charity, the International Union of Police Associations, sent more in one year to Zeitlin's companies - almost $9.2 million from March 2022 to March 2023 - than these six political action committees did in the year and a half of this election cycle.\n\nA search of 527 Explorer , a tool developed by the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica to track political nonprofits not subject to the Federal Election Commission's regulations, found five pro-law enforcement organizations active in 2024 that spent most of their money on fundraising and administrative costs. The operations have raised $2.2 million this year, though none of their expenditures went toward companies known to be connected to Zeitlin.\n\nMisleading calls from telemarketers are illegal under wire fraud laws , which apply to anyone making false claims for profit using electronic communications. Moreover, these callers also often violate Federal Communications Commission guidelines that are designed to prevent telemarketers from calling someone's cell phone and using prerecorded messages without prior written consent . But authorities can't easily stop these illegal scam calls because robocalls are cheap and easy to spoof, and it's difficult to filter between legitimate and spam robocalls.\n\nThere's little the Federal Election Commission can do against the political action committees that contract with telemarketers like Zeitlin without Congress stepping in to tighten campaign-finance regulations. In 2023, Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) introduced a bill to rein in fraudulent political action committee activities: the Stopping Corrupt Actors From Making Political Action Committees (SCAM PAC) Act , which would prevent committees from making disbursements to vendors run by the committees' operators or their relatives.\n\nIn a statement to the Lever , Porter said, \"I've repeatedly pushed Congress to crack down on bad actors and close loopholes that allow scam PACs to exist.\"\n\nBut Porter's legislation wouldn't apply to the political action committees that did business with Zeitlin, since the committee operators do not appear to be related to him. For legislation to really address the problem, advocates say it needs to be broad enough to target bad actors, while being specific enough not to infringe upon people's First Amendment right to express themselves through donations or speech.\n\nAmid all this confusion, scam committees have been able to flourish even without clear allies in Congress. There aren't any obvious lobbyists for scam political action committees or telemarketers in Washington, as the business is a loosely connected network of operators, not an established, defined industry.\n\n\"This is just an issue that is falling to the back burner when there are so many other really pressing issues in Washington,\" said Michael Beckel, research director at Issue One, an advocacy organization seeking to reduce the influence of big money in politics.\n\nScam political action committees are more of a problem on the Right. Research from Zhao Li, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, found that more than 80 percent of alleged scam political action committees identified from news reports framed themselves as ideologically conservative. One reason for this may be that robocall scams are more likely to go after older Americans, who tend to be more politically conservative and more likely to make political donations than younger Americans.\n\nAlong with its legislative recommendations, the Federal Election Commission has proposed updating its website to display more information about political action committees and improving outreach to help educate the general public about where their political donations are going.\n\nBut such efforts aren't sufficient to address the problem without increasing regulations, Ann Ravel, former chair of the commission, told the Lever .\n\n\"A lot of those people who are the victims of scams, they're not going to be looking at the FEC's regulations,\" said Ravel.\n\nWith regards to telemarketers, the Federal Trade Commission publishes a list of common phone scams , including charity scams. Experts also advise registering for the Do Not Call list and installing a spam robocall-blocking app.\n\nZeitlin, meanwhile, is not the only one allegedly profiting from this regulatory oversight. With scam political action committees proliferating on both the Left and the Right , it's likely that scammers will keep calling.\n\nPerri, for one, has started hanging up. While he receives spam calls asking for donations several times a week, he is no longer donating.\n\n\"I'm definitely not going to support anymore, knowing that it's a scam,\" he said. \"I'm just not going to give in this time if they try reaching out again.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nJean Yi is a journalist in Los Angeles focusing on local investigative reporting and data journalism.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

A messy legal struggle for control of the prison-tech empire is exposing the big business of profiting off mass incarceration.\n\nInmates make collect phone calls at the Sheriff's Central Men's Jail in 2011 in Orange County, California.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe yacht is moored at the mouth of the Miami River, in the long shadows of the city's luxury hotels and high-rises. It is of Italian design: sleek, imposing, with a flybridge and sundeck and five cabins, and a price point of about $10 million. On the hull, bold silver lettering declares its name: Convict .\n\nThe Convict is the crown jewel of prison technology company Smart Communications, whose CEO, Jonathan Logan, has a reputation for flaunting the millions he has made in the business of prisons and jails. There is also Logan's $300,000 Lamborghini, with a license plate that reads \"INMATE.\" There are the photos he posts dressed in garish suits , posed in the driver's seat of his Rolls-Royce.\n\nThe yachts, the cars - they all form part of Smart Communications' \"empire,\" as insiders refer to it. The company rakes in tens of millions in revenue each year from its prison communications tech, a business model that mostly involves charging people incarcerated in the US prison system to send emails (50 cents a pop) or make phone calls (7 cents a minute) or leave thirty-second voicemails ($1 each).\n\nIt is an empire over which Logan is now battling for control.\n\nLogan once owned the company together with his father, James Logan, who died in 2022, leaving his shares in Smart Communications to his wife. Ever since, Jon Logan has been waging a vicious fight to wrest control of the company from the rest of his family, a succession battle that has played out in several courts across multiple states, drawing yachts and mansions and a dozen exotic cars into its crosshairs.\n\nInadvertently, the bitter feud has also pried open the internal workings of Smart Communications. The result is an unparalleled look into the immense fortunes and aggressive sales tactics driving the for-profit takeover of the nation's carceral system.\n\nOver the last decade, Smart Communications has emerged as a new pioneer in the ongoing privatization of prison services, a market that is constantly finding new ways to squeeze pennies out of incarcerated people and their families, one of the poorest demographics in the country. The $10 million yacht called Convict is a floating metaphor for the unchecked profits of the industry.\n\nIn 2022, reporting from the Appeal revealed that Smart Communications was offering cruises in the Caribbean to sheriffs and jail officials who bought the company's technology. At the time, Logan claimed that no such cruise had set sail. Yet a trove of court documents now reveals how Smart Communications has - over the course of a decade - wined and dined public officials to build its business. Company executives brought sheriffs to steakhouses and strip clubs in an effort to win contracts. They offered them all-inclusive hotel stays , spa treatments, and booze cruises .\n\nPresiding over it all was Jon Logan, the company's flashy and volatile CEO, who - all while hosting glamorous yacht parties in Miami - has gone to great lengths to keep the company in his own hands. His parents alleged that this included holding them at gunpoint while demanding his father turn over his company shares.\n\nThe Lever 's account of Logan and Smart Communications is based on a review of hundreds of pages of court documents that span nearly two decades, internal company emails obtained by us, and interviews with multiple former company employees, including an employee who worked on the Convict . The Lever also spoke at length with Logan, who said he was being \"publicly crucified over false information\" (including the alleged gun incident) and that his legal battles are being waged to protect the company.\n\n\"The bigger story is how people are willing to do this, to try and extort money from an innocent person,\" he told us. \"Which, I'm sorry, but that is me. I'm an innocent person. I built a business, I employ a lot of people, and I connect a lot of families, and I've done nothing wrong. And yet I am being painted as the bad guy.\"\n\nAs for the Rolls-Royce he's been photographed in? Logan noted that his Phantom is a 2015 model. \"Guess what? It's a ten-year-old Rolls-Royce,\" he said, adding that he had bought it (and his $350,000 Ferrari Spider) used. \"I like cars. There's nothing wrong with that. I've earned that.\"\n\nCharging people in prison to communicate with the outside world has long been good business. For many years, this was the domain of prison phone companies, which began operating payphones in the nation's prisons and jails in the 1970s . It took some time, though, before these providers began to treat prisons as a captive market. In the beginning, the cost of making a phone call in prison was roughly the same as in the world beyond. By the 1990s, that had changed: rates for prison phone calls were rising dramatically , even as telecom costs decreased for everyone else.\n\nPerks for prison bosses have always been a central feature of this business, although they have not always taken the form of strip clubs and Caribbean cruises. As phone companies jockeyed for prison contracts in the '80s, they began to court corrections officials by offering agencies a share of the revenue. For every $1 a prisoner spent on a phone call, say, the phone company would take 60 cents, and the prison would take the rest. Perversely, then, phone companies competed in the prison market not by decreasing rates but by raising them.\n\nPrison phone calls were soon stacked with surcharges and extraneous fees, revenue that was then funneled back to prisons (the vast majority of which were taking a cut of the profits). There was a circular logic to the growth of the industry: Mass incarceration in the 1970s and '80s had saddled new costs on county jails and prisons, leaving sheriffs and corrections agencies strapped for cash. Revenue from prison phone calls, then, was a welcome salve. And the more people who were incarcerated, the more phone calls would be made.\n\nBy the mid-aughts, prison telecom had become highly consolidated, with just two firms controlling most of the market. There was also regulation on the horizon: the nation's telecom regulator, the Federal Communications Commission, was poised to cap prison call rates after years of pressure from reform advocates, which would mean swift cuts to companies' profits. The moment was ripe for new competition.\n\nIt was at just this moment that Trey Engelke met the Logan family. Engelke was an insurance agent in Tampa, a magnate with deep pockets and powerful friends. His circle included Pam Bondi, now President Donald Trump's US attorney general, who at the time was running for state office in Florida. \"A big traveling guy, and usually had an entourage anywhere he went,\" as Jim Logan would later describe Engelke. And, critically, he was the guy who \"paid for virtually everything for everybody.\"\n\nIn 2009, Engelke was dating Alexis Logan, Jon Logan's older sister, who would later serve as Smart Communications' attorney. (Alexis declined to be interviewed for the story when reached by phone and did not respond to additional inquiries.) Over dinner one night, Jim Logan told Engelke about an idea his son Jon had conceived: email for jails, which would be installed in payphone-like kiosks in the mess halls.\n\n\"The entire concept had potential,\" Engelke would later recall in a court deposition. Phone calls and snail mail were, at that time, the only means of communication in prisons, which had allowed telecom companies to charge sky-high rates. This, he thought, \"seemed like a better mousetrap.\"\n\nThere was, though, the issue of money. At one time, before the family moved to Florida, Jim Logan was a business mogul in Central Michigan, where he and his wife, Janice, had raised their two children. He owned a marina and a few different auto businesses. But court records indicate that, by 2009, he was in hot water with the Internal Revenue Service, and money was tight. It was also the height of the financial crisis - capital was hard to come by.\n\nOver drinks and oysters, the Logans began to court Engelke as an investor. Alexis had reservations about the potential business partnership, Engelke later recalled. But he was increasingly convinced that there were millions to be made in the Logans' new business, Smart Communications, which had by the summer of 2010 secured a contract to provide the email technology in a small county jail in southeastern Florida. In a few installments, Engelke put down $250,000.\n\nThat summer, Engelke and the Logans began what they called \"prospecting,\" meeting with different sheriffs across Florida and the South to try to sell the technology to county jails. But business was slow. Sheriffs were skeptical about the product. \"It was hard to get other jails to want to install this,\" Jon Logan later testified in court.\n\nThere was, though, something that Engelke thought could take the company national: the American Correctional Association (ACA). He called it their \"golden goose.\" \"The hub to the spokes, if you will, was, in my opinion, at that time the ACA,\" he said in a 2022 deposition.\n\nThe American Correctional Association, the venerable trade association for the corrections industry, a conduit to sheriffs and prison officials across the country, an incubator of cutting-edge prison technologies - Engelke saw the organization as the path to big profits. And he knew the guy who led it: Mike Wade, a sheriff in Virginia.\n\nThe company's efforts to win Wade's favor became the playbook it would follow with other targets in the years to come. An associate of Engelke's flew Wade down to Tampa so that the sheriff could \"talk with Jim and I more about potential with ACA,\" Engelke said in a deposition. The pair took the sheriff out for $100 steaks. They brought him to a party and to the Mons Venus, a strip club in Tampa. (Wade, who has since retired, did not respond to inquiries from the Lever . Engelke declined to comment on the events.)\n\nAs Engelke tells it in court pleadings, from that point forward, Wade was all in. \"I had [Wade] telling me, 'I think I can make this big, and I may not run again next term, and I may even come to you for a job,'\" Engelke recalled. The American Correctional Association seemed to be behind them. The winds in the prison technology business were shifting.\n\nAt the same time, cracks were emerging across the operation. Engelke's relationship with Alexis Logan was fraying; they had split by the end of 2010. He began to understand there was deep underlying strife among the members of the Logan family.\n\n\"[Alexis] and her brother hated each other,\" Engelke said. \"I think Jon hated his mom too.\" But the only way out was forward, he thought: \"I tried to, shall we say, guide through those waters, or manage around them, so as not to sink the empire.\"\n\nEngelke also began to have concerns about how corporate dollars were being spent. At lunch with Jon Logan early on, he recalls confronting the young executive about a company-expensed trip to the Florida Keys.\n\n\"This is my fucking company,\" Logan shot back, according to Engelke. \"And if I want to take a girl to the Keys for the weekend and charge it to the company, I'll do so.\"\n\n(\"Did you ever investigate whether Jon Logan took this trip to the Keys using [company] money?\" a lawyer asked Jim Logan years later. \"I didn't,\" he replied.)\n\nThere was another matter: Jon Logan was on probation for a criminal charge back in Michigan. And it was serious.\n\nIn one of his last communications to his son before his death in 2022, Jim Logan wrote of his son's early \"life of absolute indulgence.\" There were motorcycles, four-wheelers, snowmobiles, and jet skis; there were personal mechanics and personal trainers. \"Your mother and I even paid someone to do your school homework so you could race motorcycles,\" he wrote.\n\nBack then, the family lived in Lansing, Michigan. Jon Logan describes his relationship with his mother and sister as \"estranged\" from a young age.\n\n\"Ever since I was a young kid, she's kind of had this way about her,\" he has said of Alexis.\n\nBut he was closer with his father, and as an adult - following a stint doing professional motocross - he began working with him on a car-dealership venture. By 2007, when Logan was twenty-five, father and son were doing business with another car dealer in the neighborhood, a man named Blake Mossholder, who lived with his wife, Amy, and their three young children.\n\nAt some point, Mossholder and the Logans got into a dispute over money. There were allegations of more than $75,000 being stolen; beyond that, the details of the dispute are unclear from court records. The conflict quickly spiraled out of control. Mossholder accused Jon Logan of chasing him in a car and took out a restraining order against him. Then, in November 2007, a series of Craigslist ads appeared online in Lansing.\n\nThe posts were crude and clearly written by someone familiar with the Mossholders, since they included their cell-phone numbers and address. Under the category \"erotic services,\" they advertised sexual services provided by Mossholder's wife - \"My rates are the best in town\" - and requested that interested parties call or knock on the door. Each ended the same way: \"Ask for dirty amy.\"\n\nAt the time, Amy Mossholder was undergoing chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer; by the time that local authorities had traced the posts to Jon Logan and arrested him, the cancer had metastasized and spread to her lungs. She died in 2010. The Mossholders would recount in court the barrage of phone calls that came in response to the Craigslist ads, the cars that arrived at their home. \"We were in fear,\" Amy Mossholder testified at Logan's sentencing hearing in August 2008. \"He has not shown remorse for that, and I will never forget it.\"\n\nIn 2008, Jon Logan pleaded guilty to a charge of aggravated stalking, a felony. At his sentencing hearing, the judge said she was \"shocked beyond words at the extent of the course of conduct and the harassment that you engaged in with this family.\" It was, she said, \"viciously cruel what you did to them.\" She sentenced Logan to eleven months in county jail.\n\nIt was during these months in jail that Jon Logan says he developed the idea for Smart Communications, an origin story he repeated to the Lever .\n\n\"I know the experience of being incarcerated,\" he said. \"I know the pain that it causes. I know the separation you have from your loved ones, and that's why I created a system that has transformed this industry.\"\n\nBy the time he started the company in 2009, the Logans had moved to Florida, far from Michigan and the Mossholders. The first boat Jon Logan bought with his newfound riches, some years later, was a $1 million Nor-Tech. He named it Dirty Amy . \"Friends we will be taking #DirtyAmy out there and packing it full of loud music and cold drinks and epic times,\" Logan wrote on Facebook in June 2016. \"All aboard the #DirtyAmy.\"\n\nLogan claims that he did not write the Craigslist ads - \"I was intentionally framed,\" he told us - and emphasized that as part of his plea deal, the charges related to those posts were dropped. Yet he doesn't deny the boat's namesake. \"[The Mossholders] don't deserve sympathy,\" he said. \"I deserve justice.\"\n\nHe added: \"I want to do a tongue-in-cheek name on my boat, that's my right. I earned it.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Pennsylvania prison staff began getting sick. That August, according to state corrections officials, prison staff were sent to the emergency room for potential drug exposure forty-eight times. Prison guards were falling ill as they processed mail and searched jail cells. In fact, they were falling ill all around the country. The incidents fed into a growing hysteria about the potential dangers of airborne exposure to fentanyl and synthetic cannabinoids.\n\nExperts are dubious that it is possible for trace exposure to such drugs to cause illness, not to mention an overdose. But at the time, the Pennsylvania corrections agency was in a full-blown panic. All state prisons and their mail rooms were locked down. Officials believed that there were drugs being sent via the Postal Service, that the prison mail was, in the words of Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), \"saturated in fentanyl.\"\n\nWithin weeks of the 2018 lockdown, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections inked an emergency no-bid $15.8 million contract with Smart Communications for what was then the company's newest innovation: MailGuard, mail digitization software. Letters would be sent to Smart Communications instead of the prison, which would scan them and provide inmates a digital copy - in theory cutting off the flow of contraband.\n\nThe Pennsylvania contract represented a big break for Smart Communications.\n\n\"That was when they started to really build their business,\" said Bianca Tylek, the founder and executive director of Worth Rises, an advocacy group focused on prison industries. \"After [Smart Communications] got that contract, that practice started to spread around the country.\" Prisons and jails in more than two dozen other states now digitize their mail.\n\nBefore the Pennsylvania contract, Smart Communications was \"basically on the verge of extinction,\" Logan would later testify in court. The private-equity-owned prison telecom giants - companies like Securus and Global Tel Link - were moving into prison email, squeezing Smart Communications out of the market.\n\nMail scanning changed everything. While not particularly profitable on its own, Smart Communications used the technology as bait to win bigger contracts by bundling MailGuard with the company's phone and messaging services.\n\n\"MailGuard was the Trojan horse,\" Logan explained in court this February. \"If you need MailGuard, you are going to have other services exclusively by SmartComm.\"\n\nThose other services are the real moneymakers in the prison tech business: emails, video chats, music streaming, all provided on physical tablets that inmates must buy. Messaging income alone (the 50-cent charge per email) brought Smart Communications revenue of more than $25 million annually as of 2022.\n\n\"We actually . . . make more money by giving [MailGuard] away for free and getting all the revenue-generating services,\" Logan testified.\n\nWhile mail-scanning technology was an important point of entry to new profits for the company, its impact on incarcerated people is to further sever them from the outside world. Instead of handwritten letters from their loved ones, people in Pennsylvania's prisons receive digital scans, some so poorly rendered that they are illegible .\n\nEven when readable, there's a difference between receiving a birthday card or child's drawing that you can hold in your hands and one that is scanned in a warehouse in Florida, sent to you digitally, and then destroyed. As one mother whose son is incarcerated told the Nation , \"You cannot scan or copy the tears of a loved one!\"\n\n\"One of the greatest predictors of whether or not someone is going to successfully reenter society after their release is whether they have strong family and friendship connections that they can rely on as they work to reestablish their lives,\" said Mike Wessler, communications director at the Prison Policy Initiative, a research group that closely tracks prison technology and its impacts. Mail scanning was just one example of the ways that privatized prison services can erode those ties, Wessler explained. So too does paying exorbitant phone and messaging costs, which send prisoners and their families into debt .\n\n\"These millionaires have found a way to squeeze more money and sever these connections that are so important,\" he said. That, he said, was \"what those yachts represent.\"\n\nDespite the fervor that won Smart Communications its Pennsylvania contract, it's not clear that mail digitization solves the problem of drugs entering the prison system. In 2023, five years after the state started mail scanning, a PennLive report found that people inside Pennsylvania prisons are testing positive for drugs at an even higher rate than in 2018.\n\nThat leaves one clear beneficiary of the technology: Smart Communications.\n\n\"They've just inserted themselves as a middleman and are taking money off the top,\" Wessler said.\n\nLogan argues that his innovations - prison email in particular - have helped to connect people who are incarcerated with their loved ones on the outside.\n\n\"I let inmates use my kiosk system that I paid for, I built, I designed, and all I do is ask them to pay the same amount that they would pay the US Postal Service - only they get to instantly communicate with their family,\" he told the Lever .\n\nThese systems have made Logan rich. His company's growth since the 2018 contract has been rapid. Smart Communications now operates in twenty-nine states, in over one hundred jails and prisons. Between 2021 and 2023, its revenue jumped from $32.3 million to $56.2 million. Last year, he recorded a salary of $1.2 million (which he says he has since forfeited, given his legal troubles).\n\nAround that time, Logan bought his superyacht.\n\nThere came a moment, in the early days of Smart Communications, when Engelke began to feel nervous about the Logans' handling of finances, a story he told several times in court depositions. Back in 2010, he says, he lent some money to Alexis Logan. Some time later, he tried to recoup it, only to discover that her mother, Janice, had allegedly used the cash on a facelift. (Jon Logan's attorneys also allege in court pleadings that family members used company money for \"cosmetic and medical procedures.\")\n\nFrom that point forward, Engelke says, he was distrustful of the family.\n\n\"I was very uncomfortable with the way they were taking money out of the company and abuse of credit cards, things like that,\" Engelke said in a deposition. Still, he too had his eye on future riches: \"I want to make millions with you, then party like a rock star on our yacht!\" the investor wrote to Jon Logan in a 2010 email.\n\nBut he never saw the millions or the yacht. By the time Smart Communications began to take off in 2018, Engelke had been cut out of the company. He maintains that he is a 10 percent shareholder and has spent the better part of the last decade suing Smart Communications and the Logans to get his slice of the pie.\n\n\"I was the sole investor at the beginning,\" Engelke told the Lever . \"I kept the company alive by loaning substantial amounts of money for expansion.\"\n\nSo far, he has been outmaneuvered, and Smart Communications has remained a family business.\n\nThe Logans contest who among them rightfully controls the company, but all of them have been spending its money. This is made clear in court records, in which Jon Logan and his mother trade dueling accusations about the other's \"corporate waste.\"\n\nThere are the cars Jon Logan bought: the Rolls-Royce, the Ferrari, the Lamborghini. But his father, too, was allegedly buying cars with company cash before he died, including a $100,000 BMW as well as two Corvette Stingrays.\n\nJanice accuses her son of wasting company money on food and travel - a $1,600 sushi dinner, a $10,000 ski trip to Colorado, a $3,000 fishing charter - and on yacht trips. Jon accuses his parents of spending $150,000 on diamond jewelry. His mother points to his luxury $1.5 million condo in Downtown Miami and a $4 million waterfront home in Tierra Verde. Jon claims his mother and sister secretly bought a $1.2 million vacation home in Michigan with company funds, and that his sister was charging personal expenses to company credit cards for years after she left her position there.\n\nThen there is the Convict . The $10 million yacht, which the company owns, costs $10,000 a month to harbor at a marina in Miami. According to court pleadings, Logan employs a full-time captain, who is paid a six-figure salary, and a full-time deckhand. One person who worked on the Convict described to the Lever the parties Logan was \"always hosting\" on the boat: classic \"party-scene Miami,\" they said.\n\n\"Jon has treated the company's resources as a personal piggy bank and grossly wasted corporate assets,\" his mother's attorneys wrote in an August 2023 court filing.\n\nSuch extravagance, though, is in some sense a pillar of Smart Communications' business. The company sells its technology in part by promising a taste of the \" resort life \" that prison phone calls can buy. To its clients - sheriffs and prison officials - Smart Communications offers cruises and all-inclusive retreats at Florida resorts, in addition to generous cuts of the revenue from its prison services.\n\nIn 2022, Smart Communications came under scrutiny after the Appeal reported that the company had offered several sheriffs a complimentary cruise that \"sails out of Tampa Bay to the Caribbean.\" In some cases, the cruise was stipulated in contracts that jails signed with Smart Communications. At the time, Logan said that there had been no cruise to the Caribbean. \"This event never came to fruition and has never happened,\" he told us.\n\nWhat have taken place are Smart Communications' \"summits,\" retreats for clients in Clearwater Beach, Florida (\"famous for its white sands and clear blue waters,\" the company advertises). According to an itinerary of one of these events from 2022, the \"Elite Sheriff's and Leaders Summit,\" attendees were treated to a three-day, all-inclusive stay at the Hyatt Regency Beach Resort & Spa, where rates start at about $600 a night. Activities included dinner at a local steak house, spa treatments, golfing, and a \"sunset boat cruise.\"\n\nAccording to emails obtained by the Lever , the company extended a similar offer in September 2020 to Major Shaun Klucznik, the jail administrator at the Hernando County Sheriff's Office in West Florida.\n\n\"We will take you out to eat, put you up in the Hilton Clearwater Beach Resort,\" a Smart Communications sales representative wrote, offering \"a choice of fishing or golf and women having a beach excursion\" as well as \"a Booze Cruise in the gulf.\"\n\n\"I appreciate the offer but we cannot participate in events like this,\" Klucznik replied.\n\n\"Well darn!\" the company's sales representative wrote back. \"Just wanted to show appreciation to our clients!\"\n\nIn May 2024, the sales representative again reached out to Klucznik, who by that point was also serving as vice president of the board of the American Jail Association, a jail industry group. That spring, the association was holding its annual conference in Fort Lauderdale. Smart Communications, the representative wrote, already had \"something special planned for the board\" - but the company had an additional offer for Klucznik, a \"once in a lifetime experience\": a \"hospitality event\" on \"our 100 ft private yacht.\" (Klucznik says he also declined this proposition.)\n\nIn response to questions about the summits, Logan said that the events \"bring in outside educators for corrections professionals that teach classes that contribute to agency-required accreditation training hours each year, as well as showcase Smart Communications' newest technologies of the future.\" Attendance, he said, is \"open to all correctional professionals and has no relation to current, past, or future business involvement with Smart Communications.\"\n\nOther competitors and prospective clients have raised ethical concerns about the overtures. \"We felt the proposal was borderline criminal and definitely was unethical,\" one county jail administrator in Arkansas said of their dealings with Smart Communications. The 2019 contract bid included a promised \"three-day cruise to Mexico\" and an \"immediate\" $100,000 payout for the county, no strings attached. (Logan called the comments an \"intentional mischaracterization\" made amid an ongoing legal dispute between Smart Communications and another vendor.)\n\nOne rival of Smart Communications complained that the company was offering gratuities , which can be illegal , to win contracts, according to reporting from the Appeal .\n\nThe legality of such steak dinners, cruises, and hotel stays \"at the local level is dependent on state ethics laws, which vary,\" said Aaron Littman, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, whose research has focused on sheriffs and jails. But he called the offers \"really troubling.\"\n\nSmart Communications' brazen method of courting sheriffs, Littman said, highlighted just how little external accountability exists for sheriffs and local jail systems, despite the potential for conflicts of interest with vendors. \"Their insulation from public oversight is really on display here,\" he said.\n\nThe Lever reached out to eighteen sheriff's offices and jail administrators that contract with Smart Communications asking if they had participated in retreats or cruises. All twelve that responded said they had not, although some acknowledged receiving the offers. The rest did not reply.\n\n\"I am not one to fuck with on what I created with sheer willpower and brains,\" Jon Logan wrote to his father in September 2022, weeks before his death. \"If you, Janice, or Alexis try to take anymore [sic] from me, I am prepared to do things the normal human could never fathom.\"\n\nAs his health declined in the fall of 2022, Jim Logan had started making preparations for his death and the succession battle he expected was to come. Although he had taken a back seat in company operations in recent years - partly due to his reported struggles with alcoholism, which a Florida judge concluded had been \"getting the better of him\" by the end - father and son still owned 50 percent each of the company shares.\n\nJon Logan wanted to buy his father out. \"I want a simple contract and a simple buyout and clean separation,\" he wrote in the September email. His father refused.\n\nInstead, days before a risky surgery, the elder Logan transferred his shares in the company to a trust that he left in the hands of his wife, Janice. He wrote his son back days later, quoting the earlier email: \"Most humans could never fathom a son who says that to his family for any reason, let alone a son sitting atop his $10,000,000 yacht, next to his $2M condo, with a Rolls, a Lamborghini, and Ferrari parked at his $5,000,000 beach house. Exactly what did your family take from you?\"\n\nTwo different attorneys representing Janice Logan did not reply to multiple inquiries from the Lever for this story.\n\nIn his parents' telling, Jon Logan had gone to extraordinary lengths to convince his father to hand over his shares of the company. That included allegedly threatening them with a firearm. Jim Logan, in an email , claimed that his son had \"broken into our home and held us at gunpoint demanding that I sign my shares over,\" in addition to vandalizing his parents' cars and sending death threats.\n\nLogan says this is \"a false, baseless, zero evidence claim\" that his mother is using to win the court's sympathy. Despite the conflict, his father had been his \"best friend,\" Logan told the Lever . \"I don't think anyone could blame me for not being pleased that some of the worst communications I've had with my dead father now are being publicly displayed and rummaged through,\" he said.\n\nJim Logan died in October 2022, leaving Janice Logan, through the trust, as a 50 percent shareholder of Smart Communications. (Jon Logan claims that his mother removed him from the trust, leaving only herself and his sister as its beneficiaries.) Ever since, Janice and her son have been battling over the company's millions, a fight that has turned increasingly ugly.\n\nInitial negotiations between the two stalled after Jon Logan offered his mother a $20 million buyout, which she refused, instead demanding $100 million, according to text messages between the two. \"I said . . . 'Why would I accept $20 million?'\" Janice testified at a February trial. \"And he got real ugly with me and used language I don't use. So I just hung up on him.\" Instead, she sent him a letter demanding, among other things, that he sell the Convict and give her control over the company's spending.\n\nJanice Logan lives in a $4 million mansion owned by the company, a gated villa with a home movie theater, stables, and an indoor pool with a waterfall. It lies on a twenty-acre property on the outskirts of Sarasota, alongside an expanse of wild Florida marshlands and longleaf pine forest. This spring, Logan filed for eviction against his mother, demanding that she pay $35,000 a month in order to stay in the home.\n\nJon explained to the Lever that he wants to sell the property: \"When the company owns the asset, the company ought to have its right to do what it wants with the asset,\" he said.\n\nSo far, the courts have mostly rejected Jon Logan's attempts to wrest back control of the company. A Sarasota judge intervened and stopped the eviction case in July 2023, allowing Janice to stay in the mansion. Jon then attempted to move some of Smart Communications' subsidiaries to Delaware , seemingly to escape the Florida courts. A Delaware judge - noting the \"alarming nature of the allegations\" in the Florida case - froze the proceedings.\n\nThen in November 2024, days after a Sarasota probate judge had set a date for trial, Smart Communications filed for bankruptcy, claiming that it was in tens of millions of debt to a Delaware company owned by Jon Logan. On February 26, a judge also blocked that case, sending it once again back to Florida court, where the Sarasota judge has issued several rulings in favor of Janice.\n\n\"Jon Logan here has spite and animus towards his mother and his sister, and that's what's driving decisions, not business judgment, not what's good for the company,\" the judge said at a recent hearing.\n\n\"We haven't been getting a fair shake with these judges at all, and it's evident,\" Logan said of the litigation. In a subsequent email to the Lever , he said he was \"a victim of terrorism through the legal system\" and that his mother and sister were trying to \"extort\" money from the company.\n\nThere are, too, other \"storm clouds on the horizon,\" as one judge put it. In 2023, former President Joe Biden signed the Martha Wright-Reed Act into law, which directed telecom regulators to cap rates that prison phone providers, including Smart Communications, could charge. Although prison telecom companies and states have flooded the courts with litigation to stop them, the rate cuts went into effect in November 2024.\n\n\"It is completely gutting the business model of providers in our space,\" Logan testified in court in February. The rules required the company to cut fees, which, he said, represented a profit loss of \"half a million dollars a month.\"\n\nYet Smart Communications has found success through the years by identifying new, unregulated corners of the prison market.\n\n\"I think that's where Smart Communications was ahead of the game with some of their technology,\" Wessler said. \"They were moving into these unregulated market spaces before many of the other major players in the prison phone industry.\"\n\nThey have been, in other words, a bellwether of sorts in the prison technology market.\n\nWhere is Smart Communications pivoting now? Despite the legal drama, the company has been on the road advertising its flashy new products, marketing them at correctional industry conferences around the country: a supposedly first-of-its-kind smartwatch for inmates, a prison exercise bike. A recent PowerPoint presentation included in court documents advertising the company's latest innovations looks, at first glance, like the flyer for a yoga class, featuring a man standing in a grassy meadow, staring at an amorphous orb of light.\n\n\"What is the next Revolution of Corrections?\" it asks. \"Mind. Body. Spirit. Smart Communications welcomes you to the future of incarceration.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nKatya Schwenk is a journalist based in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

It was only the most recent episode in which politicized police forces have intervened to thwart democracy - and the US is far from immune to the problem.\n\nMilitary police soldiers walk near Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. (Mauro Pimentel / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThere's an important lesson for Americans in the Brazilian election that just ended in the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro's defeat. No, it's not about the fact that a less wealthy, more recently established democracy of over two hundred million people managed to get all their votes counted in a day, though this should obviously spark some reflection about the notoriously slow and chaotic nature of US elections.\n\nInstead, it's about the dangers of a politically extreme police.\n\nThe rapturous celebrations over the victory of left-wing challenger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva last night were preceded by alarm that Brazil's federal highway police were trying to steal the election from him. Reports of traffic jams and massive delays caused by police checkpoints on election day sparked fears of voter suppression, particularly since they were taking place overwhelmingly in Brazil's northeast, a pro-Lula stronghold. According to a police memo obtained by the Brazilian Report , searches of vehicles shot up by 80 percent on the day of the runoff compared to the general election at the start of October.\n\nYou didn't have to look far for other evidence of political motives. A shockingly large portion of Brazilian police already didn't trust the country's electoral system and preferred returning to dictatorship. The day before voting, the head of the highway police had urged his followers to vote Bolsonaro on Instagram, before deleting the post. And the scheme had reportedly been cooked up two weeks earlier in the Brazilian presidential residence by members of the Bolsonaro campaign.\n\n\"You wouldn't even need to give an explicit order for anything,\" a member of the campaign told O Globo , Brazil's paper of record. \"As the strength of these police forces is basically composed of supporters of the president, the consequence of such an operation is obvious.\"\n\nThe plot didn't work, with Lula eking out a narrow victory. But the effort almost certainly suppressed the pro-Lula vote in a race that had dramatically narrowed in the final weeks, and had it worked, it could've at minimum created a political crisis and all the attending chaos and danger that would've brought.\n\nThere's an important lesson here for the US public and politicians, about how a powerful, largely unchecked, and increasingly extreme law enforcement establishment can become a serious threat to democracy in the right conditions. While not every cop is a dangerous extremist, such elements are, alarmingly, no small part of the country's police forces.\n\nLeaked FBI files show that the Bureau has for many years been investigating the problem of white supremacist infiltration of police and other law enforcement agencies, with which they have \"active links.\" Police message boards and Facebook groups are rife with racism and paranoid, violent posts about Antifa and Black Lives Matter protesters. At least five police trainers who have trained hundreds of officers around the country were found to have similar records of far-right postings. A shocking number of cops subscribe to the QAnon \"theory,\" a delusional fantasy based on a series of anonymous social media posts that holds Donald Trump is at the head of a battle to save the country from a pedophilic cabal of Democratic elites. A recent survey of one-sixth of US sheriffs found they're a lot more conservative than the average American and backed Trump's actions while he was in office.\n\nAmericans have already gotten a taste of this with the events of January 6, where thirty off-duty police officers were among the crush of people who forced their way into the Capitol to try and stop the certification of the 2020 election result. Since then, we've learned there's a worrying degree of sympathy , or at best indifference, toward the extreme, violent elements of the riot and their motives among a variety of law enforcement agencies.\n\nWe've seen similar stories play out elsewhere. A police mutiny was a central part of the successful far-right coup in Bolivia in 2019, before democracy later prevailed. Meanwhile, as the New York Times reported in 2015, the disappearance of firearms from police stations and subsequent rumors that they were headed to the capital was a key precipitating factor in the toppling of Ukraine's president in 2014 - an episode that should be especially relevant to Americans, given the piles of dangerous military equipment that even local police forces have been given since September 11.\n\nAt minimum, the events in Brazil should spur a concerted program rooting out extremists from law enforcement agencies in the United States, as well as more ardently curbing the pipeline of dangerous military equipment to them. Ideally, it would also mean the revival of commonsense police reform legislation that died last year, and which an executive order signed by Joe Biden earlier this year did not make up for , since the order only affects the small corps of federal law enforcement officers.\n\nAll of this would be politically difficult of course, but it's one of several necessary steps for protecting democratic rights. Recent history shows how rogue police forces, even if they aren't an ever-present threat to democracy, can in the right political conditions - and if their politicization isn't checked - easily become one.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

The problem of racist policing won't be solved by more visibility.\n\nBystanders film police using smartphones and camcorders as they confront protesters in Harlem on May 30, 2020 in New York City. David Dee Delgado / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n\"How Many Weren't Filmed?!\" These words appeared on a cardboard sign held by a camo-clad man at a recent protest in Decatur, Georgia, against the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.\n\nThe words were also printed in block letters on a banner carried by demonstrators in Manchester, England, scrawled in pen on a woman's face mask in New York City, and Sharpied on poster boards in towns and cities elsewhere.\n\nThe question captures the complex reality of police brutality in the age of smartphones. It alludes, on the one hand, to how smartphones have been repurposed as a tool to fight the police, and on the other, to the limitations of smartphones as a tool to fight a mammoth, militarized, decentralized institution with a deep-rooted history of violence against poor people, particularly poor people of color.\n\nThe question also encourages us to look a bit more closely at our pocket computers, to see our smartphones as more than just a tool. Machines, Gilles Deleuze once argued, \"express those social forms capable of producing them and making use of them.\"\n\nSmartphones are incredibly expressive machines. The ways we use them reveal the social relationships and structures of power that undergird modern society - including its racial divides.\n\nBefore smartphones, police violence went mostly unseen. The deadly attack on Rodney King in 1991 stands out as an exception. It was an exception in part because the acquittal of the four LAPD officers who dealt out the vicious beating sparked a violent public response. But the assault also stands out because it was filmed by a stranger with a camcorder and sent to the local news station, providing relatively rare visual evidence of the reality of American policing.\n\nToday, smartphones are an integral part of strategies to rein in the police. Cop-watch organizations, which have been around for decades in cities across the country, immediately recognized how smartphones could be repurposed to document and potentially reduce the oppression of people of color by law enforcement.\n\nWhen Alton Sterling was killed by police for selling DVDs outside a Baton Rouge convenience store, the store's owner, Abdullah Muflahi, filmed the murder . So did the Baton Rouge nonprofit Stop the Killing, whose volunteers had been monitoring police scanner traffic.\n\nThe advent of livestreaming in particular has been a game changer, preventing police from creating a false narrative by confiscating phones and erasing video filmed by bystanders. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other groups have created smartphone apps such as Mobile Justice Michigan to make it easier for cop-watch volunteers and community organizations to film and stream interactions with police.\n\nThe digital strategies and sensibilities pioneered by cop-watch groups and civil rights organizations have permeated progressive movements in the past decade. Protesters of every stripe now come armed with smartphones and social media.\n\nWalter Scott was murdered in 2015 in North Charleston, South Carolina, by officer Michael Slager. Scott, unarmed, was shot five times in the back and legs as he tried to run from Slager and then handcuffed as he lay dying, face down in the dirt.\n\nAt Scott's funeral, the pastor thanked God for Feidin Santana , the man whose smartphone video of the killing brought Scott's killer to justice. \"Keep your phone handy, keep your charge up,\" the pastor implored the funeral attendees. \"You never know when you need to be around.\"\n\nFor many people of color, this sense of uncertainty, of never knowing when state-sponsored violence could strike, is inscribed in their relationship with their smartphone.\n\nDiamond Reynolds's impulse, after seeing her partner, Philando Castile, shot during a routine traffic stop in Minnesota in 2016, was to immediately pick up her phone and livestream his life being extinguished on the car seat next to her. Reynolds wanted the world to know that \"these police are not here to protect and serve us. They are here to assassinate us. They are here to kill us because we are black.\"\n\nTanya Marshall , a black mother, teacher, and active member of her community in Cambridge, Massachusetts, copes with uncertainty by treating her smartphone as a constant lifeline to her children. Marshall has a hard and fast house rule that her children are to keep their phones charged and handy at all times and must call her right away if they have a run-in with a police officer, so that she can intervene and hopefully prevent a violent interaction.\n\nMarshall's digital strategy for coping with the nagging fear that a police officer will harm one of her children is one that she says she shares with many other black parents. Yet this dynamic is largely absent in media narratives about smartphones. Popular treatments of phones, especially ones that focus on teens and their digital devices, tend to emphasize the dangers posed by smartphones, such as social media addiction, sexting, and cyberbullying.\n\nThese are serious concerns to be sure. But the fact that, over the past decade, phones have come to be seen as an essential element in the coping strategies of oppressed minorities, as well as broader political movements fighting for racial justice, suggests the need for a more nuanced understanding of technology that examines the ways our phones reflect and reconfigure long-standing divides over race, class, and gender.\n\nA closer look at our emerging smartphone norms also reveals the dense, and evolving, mechanisms of oppression that undergird police violence toward black and brown Americans - mechanisms that can diminish the power of digital strategies.\n\nIn the most basic sense, those who film cops have a target on their back. Stories pepper the web of people who've been intimidated, harassed, beaten, arrested, and jailed for filming interactions between law enforcement and civilians.\n\nCops also take advantage of people's perpetual connection to their phones to digitally monitor and harass activists. The Baltimore Police Department, for example, used a social media intelligence platform to monitor and arrest protestors during the unrest following the 2015 death of Freddie Gray, a young Baltimore man whose spinal cord had been severed nearly in half following a \"rough ride\" in the back of a police van.\n\nAt the same time, law enforcement agencies have responded to smartphone tactics by getting their own cameras. Six out of ten local police departments and nearly half of sheriffs' offices in the United States had deployed body-worn cameras by 2016.\n\nThis rapid uptake was initially viewed with enthusiasm by both police departments and civil rights groups. Both believed that body cameras would provide protection and accountability: cops thought cameras would protect and exonerate officers, while civil rights groups such as the ACLU believed cameras would reduce the use of force and increase police accountability.\n\nFrom the perspective of civil rights groups, the results have been disappointing. Ordinary people don't have a say in how police officers use their cameras, and cops turn their bodycams on and off at will. There is no body-camera footage, for example, from March 13, when Louisville police used a battering ram to bust into Breonna Taylor's apartment in the middle of the night, spraying her apartment with bullets, killing her in her bed.\n\nEven when police body cams are turned on, there are relatively few cases in which body-cam footage has led to officers being disciplined or jailed for violence. Moreover, while prosecutors have proven eager to use body-cam footage as evidence in court, civilians find it difficult to access the footage being used as evidence against them - footage that is shot without consent, often in private spaces.\n\nPerversely, the power of smartphones to create a vivid visual snapshot of police aggression has also had the effect of diminishing the salience of violent interactions that are not captured on film.\n\nSixteen-year-old Elena Mondragon was riding with her boyfriend in 2017 when undercover cops armed with AR-15 rifles fired on their vehicle, killing Mondragon. Few cases better exemplify gross police misconduct, yet as Melissa Nold, the civil rights attorney representing the family, told the Guardian , the case received little traction because it wasn't captured on film. \"When there's no video, that's a battle for us. People just tend to believe what is reported by the police.\"\n\nThese roadblocks and failures reinforce the obvious but important point that smartphones, body cams, and other digital devices are tools, not solutions; there is no technological fix for racist policing.\n\nNonetheless, the ways that people have woven their digital devices into the ongoing political struggle for racial justice over the past ten years are illuminating.\n\nTheir strategies reveal a dynamic terrain of resistance in which smartphones are being used to expand individual agency and to amplify a call for change that, increasingly, can no longer be ignored.\n\nNicole Aschoff is on the editorial board at Jacobin .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn recent weeks, as the coronavirus pandemic's devastation has spread, some attention has turned towards one of the most vulnerable groups in our society: those who are incarcerated, often in conditions that already posed great risks to health and safety before the coronavirus outbreak. Organizers around the country, from San Francisco to New York City to Pittsburgh , have called for a public health response that includes significant protections for incarcerated people, including the release of many prisoners.\n\nAt a moment like this, it is important to remember one of the most perverse elements of the American criminal justice system : all across the country, almost everyone incarcerated on a felony conviction loses their right to vote during the entire time they spend in prison, and often for long periods even after their release - a phenomenon advocates refer to as \"civic death.\"\n\nIn voicing support for the full restoration of voting rights to all incarcerated people in the United States, Bernie Sanders stood apart from all other candidates this primary season. While a number of current and former candidates - including Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Michael Bloomberg, Amy Klobuchar, and Elizabeth Warren - have gone on record supporting the limited restoration of voting rights for people released from prison, Sanders was alone in his call to restore the franchise to all Americans, including during the term of their incarceration.\n\nAt a CNN town hall last April, Sanders's response to an audience question about whether he would extend the vote even to people like Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber, was unequivocal. \"I think the right to vote is inherent in our democracy. Yes, even for terrible people .... If they're in jail, they're paying their price to society, [and so] they should be allowed to participate in our democracy.\" (When the moderator followed-up by informing Sanders that this position could be controversial in a general election, the senator quipped, \"I've written many thirty-second opposition ads in my life. This will just be another one.\")\n\nWhen it comes to stripping the vote from people with criminal convictions, the United States stands alone among the world's democracies. In no other democracy are people disenfranchised even after their release from prison.\n\nIn eighteen European countries, incarcerated people maintain full voting rights regardless of their offense, and eight more European countries preserve voting rights except in special cases, like when the crime committed specifically relates to electoral fraud or political manipulation. The United Kingdom, perhaps the United States' closest peer on the issue, has faced more than a decade of repeated condemnation from the European Court of Human Rights due to its own prisoner disenfranchisement policies.\n\nBernie Sanders is right. To strip voting rights away from anyone due to their entanglement with the US prison system - a world-historical achievement in detention and criminalization, more comprehensive than any other criminal justice apparatus in modern history - is an affront to democracy. And because the racial demography of incarceration skews dramatically towards African Americans and Latinos, this form of disenfranchisement disproportionately affects those who are already most likely to face barriers to voting, perpetuating a long history of racist exclusion from the American political system.\n\nBy calling for the re-enfranchisement of prisoners, Sanders is following in a proud tradition of American socialism. The socialist Eugene Debs , who in 1918 was incarcerated in a federal prison on sedition charges , once advocated a \"prison population organized upon a basis of mutuality of interest and self-government,\" with no guards or wardens in charge. \"Any honest warden would admit that 75 percent of the prison population consists of decent, dependable men,\" Debs wrote, \"and with this for a foundation I would proceed to build up the superstructure of the prison's self-determination.\"\n\nWe're a long way from Debs's vision of the self-governed penitentiary, and perhaps even further from the prison-less society he saw as an intrinsic objective of socialist politics. But in Bernie Sanders, we finally have a presidential contender willing to fight for the restoration of incarcerated voters' democratic rights - a long overdue, common sense reform that could have far-reaching implications for American prisons and the American political system.\n\nIf the United States prison population (2.3 million) were a state, it would rank thirty-sixth on the list of states by population, larger than New Mexico. If you were to add to that figure the number of people on parole or probation - 4.5 million, or about one in fifty-four Americans - this hypothetical \"Incarceration State\" would grow to the size of Tennessee or Indiana, the sixteenth and seventeenth largest states, respectively.\n\nIn 2010, a team of researchers estimated the total number of Americans with felony convictions to be about 24.7 million. If we were to take this figure as the Incarceration State's total population, it would become the third largest state in the union, smaller only than California and Texas. It would also be among the country's blackest states - 23 percent African American, about the same as North Carolina (22 percent) or New York (25 percent).\n\nThe residents of this Incarceration State - whether locked up, under supervised release, or free - face varying degrees of ballot access under the United States' current election laws. A 1969 US Supreme Court decision ( McDonald v. Board of Election Commissioners ) affirmed each state's right to limit the franchise for people with criminal convictions, so long as those policies were not explicitly discriminatory towards protected groups. (In other words, only the language of the law mattered; the disproportionality of its effects did not.)\n\nToday, involvement with the criminal justice system is the most significant predictor of voter disenfranchisement in the country, with forty-eight states limiting access to the ballot for people with felony convictions. (Incarcerated people enjoy full voting rights in Maine, Vermont, and the territory of Puerto Rico.) Restrictions range from lifetime disenfranchisement (Iowa) to the temporary loss of voting rights while serving time in prison (every state except Maine and Vermont).\n\nWhile many people with felony convictions have been re-enfranchised in recent years - including in Florida and Kentucky , which previously enforced lifetime voting bans - most people still can't vote while they're on parole (thirty-four states) or probation (thirty-one states). Nationwide, nearly every single person locked up on a felony conviction, whether they're held in a state prison, county jail, or federal penitentiary, forfeits their voting rights for the entire duration of their incarceration.\n\n\"There's this idea that once you have broken some kind of social contract, by committing a crime or whatever, you no longer have the right to participate in any part of society,\" Emmett Sanders, author of the report Full Human Beings: An Argument for Incarcerated Voter Enfranchisement , told me. (Emmett Sanders, who was incarcerated for more than twenty-two years in Illinois, has no relation to the presidential candidate of the same surname.) \"But to say that because you have trespassed, for example, you don't have the moral integrity to make a decision about issues like how the tax burden is distributed? It just doesn't make any sense. Those two things are not relatable.\"\n\nAccording to estimates from the Sentencing Project, 6.1 million people were disenfranchised due to a criminal conviction at the time of the 2016 national elections. This number represents one in forty voting-age Americans. For African Americans, the numbers are even more stark - one in thirteen voting-age African Americans was disenfranchised by a criminal conviction in 2016.\n\nChallenged to defend his position on incarcerated voters at that CNN town hall in April 2018, Sanders said, \"We live in a moment when cowardly Republican governors are trying to suppress the vote. ... I say to those people, if you don't have the guts to participate in free and fair elections, you get another job and get the hell out of politics.\"\n\nSanders is right to point out that disenfranchisement is becoming more pronounced as Republicans in many states attempt to impose minority rule. In 1979, 1.2 million people were disenfranchised due to felony convictions; this number grew steadily through 2000 (4.7 million) and 2010 (5.9 million), before reaching a possible peak in 2016 (6.1 million).\n\n\"Around the country, felony disenfranchisement has an incredibly racist past,\" said Henal Patel, director of the Democracy and Justice Program at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice. (The New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, as a nonpartisan organization, has not endorsed Bernie Sanders or any other candidate for public office.)\n\nPredictably, disenfranchisement by criminal conviction is rooted in the reactionary backlash to emancipation that has distorted American democracy since at least the nineteenth century. In their book Locked Out: Felon Disenfranchisement and American Democracy , authors Jeff Manza and Christopher Uggen show that the disenfranchisement of voters convicted of felonies was a state-by-state process that began around 1800 and reached a plateau in the 1890s.\n\nThe process took place in two distinct waves. The period between 1787 and the Civil War saw fourteen Northern and non-slave states (including New York, Pennsylvania, and California) impose new voting restrictions connected to criminal statutes: a clear response to anxieties about growing black populations in those areas. In the South, a wave of similar laws was passed as white supremacists regained control of state legislatures immediately following the Reconstruction era; between the end of the Civil War and 1899, eighteen more states barred people convicted of felonies from voting. By the turn of the twentieth century, only seven states - Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, Utah, and Vermont - had no voting prohibitions on the books for people convicted of crimes. Today, only Maine and Vermont have no such prohibitions.\n\nIn New Jersey, the state legislature first tied voting rights to conviction status through a constitutional amendment in 1844, the same year it limited the franchise to white men. That restriction has had a lasting effect on New Jersey politics. Last year, about 102,000 people were denied the right to vote because of a criminal conviction in New Jersey. African Americans comprised 43 percent of those disenfranchised voters, despite representing only about 15 percent of the state's total population.\n\nThe effects of felony disenfranchisement on rates of black political participation span generations by frustrating the formation of future voters. \"When you remove voting from the home [by disenfranchising parents], you remove a model of political participation that could affect the next generation coming up,\" Emmett Sanders told me. \"This kind of disenfranchisement is not just cutting out the voters as they exist. It's stemming the tide of future voters, as well. Entire generations are undermined in this way.\"\n\nThe disenfranchisement of incarcerated people is even more insidious when you consider the fact that prison populations are counted in the census as residents of the jurisdictions where they're housed, not where they were arrested. Through a process activists call \"prison-based gerrymandering,\" state prisoners - who disproportionately come from diverse urban centers - are usually included in the official population numbers of the majority white rural areas where most state prisons are located. This system, which resonates darkly with the history of the three-fifths compromise , distorts the districting process by artificially inflating the weight of rural votes, possibly contributing a conservative bias in the legislatures of states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\nAs Robert Saleem Holbrook, a prisoners' rights advocate who was incarcerated for twenty-seven years in Pennsylvania, put it recently, prison-based gerrymandering \"falsely bolsters the power of rural white areas, effectively using incarcerated people as voiceless tools in an unfair political system.\"\n\nEfforts to overturn lifetime voting bans - including the passage of Amendment 4 in Florida and Governor Terry McAuliffe's mass clemency measures in Virginia - have received increased attention in recent years. This has fortified efforts to restore voting rights to all people with criminal convictions, inside and outside of prison.\n\nThe first bill the House of Representatives' incoming Democratic majority introduced in 2019 was the For the People Act. This far-reaching election reform bill included a measure restoring voting rights to all people convicted of felonies immediately upon their release from prison. The bill, which would have eliminated parole and probation disenfranchisement nationwide, passed the House in a straight party-line vote (it now languishes in the Senate). Later, in November of that year, Representative Ayanna Presley (D-MA) introduced a house resolution known as the \" People's Justice Guarantee \" calling for even deeper reforms, including full re-enfranchisement for incarcerated people.\n\n\"We're in a different conversation now nationally than we were two years ago, when there was a lot of reticence [about re-enfranchising people in prison or on supervised release],\" Patel said. And while federal legislation has so far failed to pass, reformers have won key victories and significantly widened the franchise in states around the country.\n\nAs Bernie Sanders has noted, there are two states in which incarcerated people retain full voting rights, and he happens to be from one of them. (\"As it happens, in my own state of Vermont, from the very first days of our state's history... everybody can vote. People in jail can vote,\" he said in April 2018.) But as Patel pointed out, neither Maine nor Vermont provide an example of a state successfully repealing a conviction disenfranchisement policy; they're simply the only states where such policies were never enacted. (Patel also noted that Maine and Vermont are the two whitest states in the country - 95.3 and 95.2 percent white respectively, according to the 2010 census.)\n\nPatel acknowledged the need for a federal bill to restore voting rights to incarcerated people across the country, but also cautioned that the federal government is often \"slower on the uptake\" than state governments are. \"There are movements happening right now,\" Patel said. \"There are advocates in Virginia and New Mexico and Massachusetts and Illinois and California and Washington. You get one state to do it, you build momentum, and then it makes the idea of a federal bill a lot more viable.\"\n\nRecalling that federal interventions on issues like marriage equality have come only after the successful implementation of reforms at the state level, she said, \"No state has gone all the way yet. We need a state to do that. We're really pushing for New Jersey to be the first.\"\n\nIn New Jersey, advocates organize under the banner of the 1844 No More Campaign , invoking the year the state first introduced voting prohibitions for criminal convictions to draw attention to the policy's racist past. Last year, they succeeded in getting a bill through the state legislature that restored the franchise to people on parole or probation. When the new law took effect on March 17, it re-enfranchised about 83,000 voters. The New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, together with other groups, continues to organize for full restoration.\n\nActivists have made significant strides in California, as well. Taina Vargas-Edmond, founder and director of Initiate Justice , explained that California enforces a convoluted and uneven set of franchise restrictions, baring people in state prisons from voting but preserving voting rights for people incarcerated in county jails. As the California state prison system responds to concerns about overcrowding by transferring state prisoners to county jails - a phenomenon known as \" realignment \" - the state's web of voting restrictions has become even more difficult to navigate.\n\nState prisoners rehoused in county jails under realignment are allowed to vote under California law. In this way, realignment could represent an expansion of the franchise for incarcerated people in California. But in some cases, Vargas-Edmond said, jail employees fail to inform state prisoners of this right, whether out of negligence or because they're misinformed about the law themselves.\n\nThis problem is bigger than California. The sizable majority of the more than 750,000 people locked up in county jails across the country are held on charges for which they have not been convicted. A 1974 US Supreme Court decision ( O'Brian vs. Skinner ) affirmed that unconvicted prisoners, most of whom remain incarcerated simply because they can't afford bail, retain full voting rights. But very few people who find themselves in a jail cell on election day are able to actually exercise that right. (The sheriff of Cook County, where Chicago is located, recently made headlines by establishing a polling place inside his jail; were the federal government interested in preserving the Constitutional rights of unconvicted prisoners, it would require all sheriffs nationwide to follow suit.)\n\nLike in Maine and Vermont, people incarcerated in California jails must vote in the district where their last non-prison address is located, and they must vote by mail. Asked about the availability of election materials and absentee ballots, Vargas-Edmond said, \"It's a huge problem. A lot of people don't know they have the right to vote while they're incarcerated in a county jail. And unfortunately, a lot of sheriffs don't know the law themselves, or at least aren't going out of their way to make sure information about the law is available to people in their jails.\"\n\nLast year, Initiate Justice and other advocates introduced a bill in the California state legislature called the Free the Vote Act (ACA 6). If it passes, it will place the question of parole/probation re-enfranchisement on the November ballot as a state-wide referendum. If that ballot measure were to pass, California would join New Jersey as a national leader in re-enfranchisement, and about 50,000 Californians would recover their right to vote.\n\nNew Jersey and California are not the only states where the fight continues. In Massachusetts, which only introduced felony disenfranchisement in 2000, the Emancipation Initiative has knit together a coalition calling for that prohibition's repeal, in part by organizing voters outside of prison to \"donate\" their ballots to disenfranchised voters in prison.\n\nIt's true that a tremendous array of powerful pro-incarceration forces, from prison guards' unions to victims rights' groups to DAs' associations, consistently frustrate efforts to win even the most cautious reforms to the US criminal justice system. Still, both Patel and Vargas-Edmond told me that their campaigns for re-enfranchisement have had no organized opposition to speak of.\n\nOur opponents may come out of the woodwork as we move closer to nationwide re-enfranchisement. But for now, it appears this is our battle to win.\n\nIncarcerated people all over the country are eager to exercise their democratic rights. When the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice began sending surveys into state prisons, asking  incarcerated people for testimonials about their disenfranchisement, the organization only expected about ten or twelve responses, due to difficulties getting mail in and out of prisons. Instead, they received more than 100 replies, Patel told me.\n\nTheir report, A Value to the Soul , includes quotes from more than a dozen people disenfranchised by imprisonment in New Jersey. One of those people is Ron Pierce, a former Marine and lifelong New Jerseyan who was incarcerated in the state for thirty years. \"When I became a convicted person, I became relegated to the shadows,\" Pierce wrote. \"Losing my most fundamental human right - the right that protects all other rights - made me less than a full citizen, a member of the marginalized society.\"\n\nInitiate Justice conducted a similar survey of more than 1,000 people in prison and on supervised release in California, publishing their results in a report called Democracy Needs Everyone . In both states, the researchers found that incarcerated people care deeply about issues that affect their loved ones outside of prison - notably health care, education, and public safety. \"A lot of people expressed really wanting to vote for their kids' school board elections,\" Patel said.\n\nThis resonates with Emmett Sanders's own experiences while incarcerated in Illinois. \"Incarcerated people care about criminal justice reform, but they care about other things too,\" he said. \"People in prison are concerned about whether or not their children can go to school. They care about their loved ones having access to medical care, to old age care, to mental health care.\"\n\nOf course, the policy area in which incarcerated voters could likely have the most impact is criminal justice. \"In prison, your whole entire life is impacted by policy,\" Vargas-Edmond said. \"You know that policy at the administrative level determines everything, from what time you get up in the morning, to when you eat, what you can wear, how often you can contact your loved ones outside. People become acutely aware of the importance of policy and the importance of having their voice heard.\"\n\n\"People in prison are, in every way, wards of the state, with no way to demand accountability from those who are in control of them,\" added Patel. \"It's a big reason why we have a terrible criminal justice system, and mass incarceration is what it is. If they had the right to vote, you would actually see differences.\"\n\nEmmett Sanders agreed. \"What the right to vote demands, above all, is observation. There are human rights abuses happening in prison, and they'll continue as long as people aren't watching. If you have people who can vote, there's some kind of oversight,\" he told me.\n\nThe effects of incarcerated voter enfranchisement would probably be felt most strongly in local elections, particularly for those offices connected to the criminal justice system, like judges and district attorneys. (In fact, incarcerated organizers have already been instrumental in the election of reform DAs like Philadelphia's Larry Krasner .) And allowing incarcerated people to choose whether they register at their last address or in the district where they're housed - as any full enfranchisement bill should - would enhance this power still further, while also correcting some of the electoral distortions caused by prison-based gerrymandering.\n\nWhile the racial demographics of the US prison population do suggest that the Incarceration State is a blue one, when it comes to identification with particular political parties, the partisan breakdown among incarcerated people more or less mirrors the breakdown outside of prisons.\n\nStill, while the possible effects of incarcerated voter enfranchisement on national election results are impossible to predict, we shouldn't underestimate the power of re-enfranchisement to transform the national political conversation on incarceration.\n\n\"Let's think about presidential campaigns, and think about Iowa, which is the first state to weigh in during nomination season,\" Patel told me. \"Right now, Iowa is also the only state that permanently disenfranchises people because of a criminal conviction. Imagine if people incarcerated in Iowa could vote.\"\n\n\"Imagine if, every four years, when the most powerful elected officials in the country descend on Iowa to fight for every single vote, they had to campaign seriously in prisons,\" Patel continued. \"Imagine what that would mean for the candidates' platforms. Some of the brightest policy minds in the country work for these campaigns. You would see a major push for criminal justice reforms, simply because those votes would matter!\"\n\nSanders continues to struggle for the Democratic nomination for president, having emerged bruised from Super Tuesday and the subsequent round of voting on March 11, but still alive. His only viable opposition is Joe Biden, a mass incarceration zealot who has spent his decades as a lawmaker endorsing and expanding the catastrophic law-and-order policies that produced the carceral crisis we live with today. When it comes to the urgent issue of criminal justice reform, the choice for Democratic primary voters couldn't be more stark.\n\n\"I am hopeful,\" Emmett Sanders told me when I asked him about the future. \"Now we have a candidate who's actually willing to stand up and say that incarcerated people need to be heard. And I think that's very important.\"\n\nJonah Walters is a researcher at Jacobin and a graduate student in geography at Rutgers University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nThe US carceral state is a monstrosity with few parallels in history - destroying untold millions of lives and families in just a few decades. But most accounts fail to understand how it was created in the first place, and how we can finally dismantle it.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThere is a growing consensus that American mass incarceration is not only wrong but a moral abomination.\n\nWith an incarceration rate exceeding 700 people for every 100,000, Americans have built a monstrosity that has few parallels in history - destroying untold millions of lives and families in just a few decades. Future generations will no doubt wonder how the wealthiest, most developed country in the world ever tolerated such barbarism.\n\nBut when it comes to the policies necessary to deconstruct this leviathan, there's not much consensus at all - even among the Left. And that's likely because no one can agree on what exactly led to its construction in the first place.\n\nPublished in 2010, Michelle Alexander's book The New Jim Crow was a sensation. Here, finally, was the answer to why we built so many prisons: racism. The American carceral state, in her telling, was just another form of racialized social control little different than Jim Crow before it.\n\nNaomi Murakawa's The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America (2014) and Elizabeth Hinton's From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America (2016) was built on this thesis, going so far as to argue that, despite what the statistics say, there was no crime wave in American in the 1960s through 1980s. It was, in fact, a racist fiction created by political elites of both parties in order to support the mass jailing of black Americans.\n\nBut, as John Clegg and Adaner Usmani argue in Catalyst: A Journal of Theory and Strategy , this is an answer that looks less persuasive every year. Their groundbreaking essay \"The Economic Origins of Mass Incarceration\" argues that, far from a fiction, the crime wave that swept America beginning in the late 1960s was very real. And the mass imprisonment of Americans was the direct, though not necessary, consequence.\n\nClegg and Usmani argue that the choice to respond to that crime wave with more incarceration lay not in white racial animus but in the failure to build an egalitarian welfare state in America - the direct result of the underdevelopment of this country's labor movement.\n\nWithout a strong working-class movement to force the state to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor, social democracy was a dead letter in America. This meant the American state was left with only one other, far less expensive option to address the violence brewing among the poorest and most vulnerable: prisons.\n\nJacobin spoke with coauthor Adaner Usmani about how and why mass incarceration was built, and why today, nothing less than a revived labor movement is the only way to tear it all down.\n\nWhat makes your story of mass incarceration in America so different is that it starts not with diabolical reactionaries, but with a staggering rise in violent crime in America beginning in the 1960s that - despite recent narratives - was very much a real phenomenon and not some middle-class delusion. What were the conditions that led to this enormous spike in crime?\n\nYou're right that our story starts earlier, not with what politicians were doing, but with what they and the public were responding to, which is this large, decades-long increase in the rate of violence in the United States, starting in the 1960s. Crime rose massively in the United States to levels much higher than those seen in any other developed country in the postwar period.\n\nOur view is that, to understand the reasons for the rise in violence to exceptional levels, one has to understand certain exceptional facts about American economic development. This is why we focus so much in the first half of our piece on the comparative political economy of the United States.\n\nLet me just explain what I mean. We all know that America's industrial boom is a story of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Industry in the United States was taking off, with America becoming an economic power in the world.\n\nKey to our story is the observation that, in the United States, this process unfolds differently than it does elsewhere. European countries all industrialized with their own peasantries. But in the United States, the peasantry was locked in the Jim Crow South in the plantation economy - they didn't migrate north in large numbers to take those jobs. Plantation owners were adamant that they stay. So the booming industries in the North sought labor where they could find it - Italian and Polish immigrants and whoever else.\n\nThe reason this is so important to the story of crime is that it is at the heart of the labor market difficulties that African Americans confront once they do later migrate to American cities. Jobs from the first wave of industrialization didn't employ African Americans in substantial numbers. Once Jim Crow collapsed and African Americans finally came to the North in large numbers, those jobs had begun to disappear. What's more, African Americans arrived in cities and labor markets in which European immigrants had already established themselves, and in which they used America's highly local institutions to hoard jobs, housing, access to schooling, and other scarce resources.\n\nThat's how I would start the story of the rise in violence in the United States.\n\nMost people know about the black migration from the South to the North starting at the end of the First World War. But your argument is that, as poorly prepared as Northern cities were for that influx as far as job openings and housing go, there was a second African-American migration from the South in the 1940s and early '50s that truly brought things to a boil.\n\nI think that the 1940s through '50s migration from the South, numerically, was the more significant one. And it was rooted in the final, complete death of Southern agriculture - the cotton plantation economy - as well as the wartime economic boom in the '40s and then the postwar boom in the '50s and '60s.\n\nIt's important to remember that it's not just a South-to-the-North phenomenon. It's also an intra -South phenomenon - people moving from the rural South to the urban South as well. It's a story about both urbanization and migration. It's a significant transfer of people from agriculture to industry that happens in the '40s and '50s.\n\nThe way to think about all this is to observe that American industry never replaces - for African Americans in general and African American men in particular - the jobs lost to the collapse of agriculture. That is the single-fact summary of our argument about the rise in violence. In the early twentieth century, employment rates for African American men are higher than comparable rates for white men. By the middle of the twentieth century, the picture has totally changed, and African American neighborhoods in American cities are blighted by chronic joblessness.\n\nBy the early '60s, you see the beginnings of employment troubles in Northern and Southern cities for low-skilled men. You see the start of the economic transformation that becomes full-blown deindustrialization already beginning in the 1960s. And so that's one very important thing that is happening to these new migrants to American cities - the jobs that were once relatively easy to find for low-skilled young men start to leave the city, first to the suburbs, but very quickly to the Sunbelt and abroad.\n\nSo, if you're a African American migrant in the '40s or '50s, you're coming to a Northern city that already is over capacity in terms of jobs?\n\nThere is job growth in the 1940s and the 1950s, but by the 1960s, it's starting to stagnate and decline, particularly for low-skilled black men. At the same time, people with wealth are leaving American cities and moving to the suburbs, stimulated by a massive construction boom subsidized by the federal government. And that means that cities are starting to hemorrhage their tax revenues and become more difficult places in which to live.\n\nSo, the way to think about this is that, by the 1960s, jobs are leaving American cities, and people with money are leaving American cities. And those two things obviously start to reinforce each other, and social services, public services in cities start to deteriorate. And this is the context in which crime and violence start to increase - that's the big argument of the first half of the piece. To understand the rise in crime that happens in the 1960s through the 1990s, you have to understand the crisis of the American city in the North and South.\n\nNow, so far, we're still in the standard left-liberal explanation, because what you just described was white people being horrified that black people have arrived and all fleeing to the suburbs to get away. But your essay has a strong critique of that \"white flight\" narrative.\n\nOur criticism is not at all that there isn't racial animus in white America - there's no doubt that there are plenty of racist people in white America. The question is not whether this exists, but what it explains.\n\nThe point that we try to emphasize is that white Americans - both racist and not - are leaving American cities. Yes, white Americans are leaving areas of American cities in which black Americans have arrived in great numbers - but they're also leaving, in large numbers, areas of American cities and neighborhoods where black Americans have not arrived, or not arrived in great numbers. They're leaving for suburbs because cities are starting to tax them to pay for social services. All that white middle-class Americans have to do is jump across city lines and flee the grubby hands of these city governments.\n\nFleeing the prying hands of the state is, sadly, a perfectly rational, ordinary thing for a middle-class person to do. Today, white Americans have far less racist beliefs than they did in the 1960s, but this pattern still prevails everywhere.\n\nOur point is that, to understand the flight to the suburbs, you have to understand the fiscal limits on American cities. Because they are not able to tax the suburbs, it was and remains rational for people with wealth to jump ship. In this sense, you don't need racial animus to explain something like white flight. Many white Americans were animated by it, of course. But in a world in which no white American had been committed to white supremacy, I'm not sure these patterns would have looked all that different.\n\nSo, when exactly does the violent crime wave begin?\n\nCrime begins to increase in the 1960s. There's some evidence that juvenile delinquency has begun to increase by the late 1950s. But really, the kinds of crime that come to public attention - violent crimes and serious property crimes - those begin to increase in the early 1960s.\n\nWhat I find really shocking is that, in your last article for Catalyst , you reviewed two books by well-respected scholars that argued that this crime wave is a fiction of white racial animus to justify a carceral crackdown. You're extremely skeptical of that.\n\nYes, very skeptical. There are two questions here.\n\nFirst, are they right that the crime wave was fictitious? As we explain in the article, they are not. Our best data suggest otherwise. Mortality statistics and surveys of victims point in the same direction and indicate staggering increases in the level of violence.\n\nIf this is right, it raises a second question. Why do so many scholars deny the increase in crime, if it was real?\n\nMy view is that they deny it because they believe that to accept it would be to suggest that the rise in punishment was the simple, necessary result of the rise in crime. In other words, they deny it because they want to emphasize that there was something politically mediated about the rise in punishment - that the rise in punishment was not a necessary response to the rise in crime, but something that politicians chose to do.\n\nNow, my view is that these critics are right to say that punishment is political, in the sense that the state is making a policy choice to punish when it could conceivably do other things. But this need not imply that the crime wave was concocted by these politicians.\n\nOur view is that the right way to think about this problem is to observe that the crime wave was a necessary but not sufficient reason for the rise in punishment. To understand the American punitive turn, one has to understand why the American state responded to the very real rise in violence in a particular way - with penal policy rather than social policy. And this, as the big argument of the second half of our piece goes, is explained by the underdevelopment of social policy in the United States. The United States has mass incarceration because it doesn't have social democracy.\n\nBut the liberal left today is really afraid of this argument. They see it as a slippery slope to justifying a police state.\n\nExactly, and this is the critical mistake that these scholars make, which is to assume that to observe that crime is occurring is to justify a punitive response to that crime. But the second thing just doesn't follow from the first.\n\nYes, if crime is occurring, one could make the argument that the right way to respond to crime is through police and prisons. But one could also make the argument that the right way to respond to crime is through a combination of rehabilitative penal policy and generous social policy. Nothing in the observation that crime is occurring entails the conclusion that mass incarceration or mass policing is justified. And that has been a basic conceptual confusion. It has marred a lot of this critical literature.\n\nLet's get back to the 1960s, because at the same time the crime wave was happening, you have, for the first time in many years, the liberal left taking power in the United States. This is the Kennedy-Johnson \"Great Society\" era. In your earlier Catalyst essay, you point out that a lot of what the Great Society liberals proposed as solutions to the crime wave were, in fact, rooted in broad social democratic analysis with big, social democratic prescriptions. Do I have that right?\n\nI think that's absolutely right. If you read the Kerner Commission's report on the riots, or even if you read the Katzenbach Commission's report on crime in American cities, a lot of the language there is thoroughly social democratic, and the analysis is structural in nature. Fundamentally, the argument is effectively the argument that I was making before, which is that the root problems here lie in unemployment and poverty in American cities.\n\nThe issue in the 1960s was not, as these books I reviewed argued, that liberals had a flawed analysis or even had the wrong policy prescriptions. It is fundamentally - and this is the big argument of the piece - a story of the incapacity of American liberals to carry out the social policy they supported.\n\nAs we argue in the piece, to understand that incapacity, one has to appreciate the enduring underdevelopment of social democracy in the United States. Fighting crime with social policy is expensive. It requires massive redistribution from rich to poor. That's something that has just not been a political possibility in the United States over the course of the twentieth century.\n\nSo, is the problem that the Democratic Party is actually a very poor replacement for an actual social democratic party? If we had a labor movement that hadn't been so violently repressed, if it had managed to form its own party, as labor movements in the rest of the developed world did, and bring about social democratic reforms, would that have prevented the carceral state from developing?\n\nYes. I think that if you had to pinpoint a root cause, it is the underdevelopment of the American labor movement. It has meant that the closest thing we have to what's thought of as a social democratic party in the United States is the Democratic Party, which is this terrible coalition in the 1960s of Southern Democrats and Northern liberals. It is nothing like a social democratic party either in form or content. That fact profoundly constrained American social policy before the 1960s, in the 1960s, and it continues to do so to this day.\n\nTo be clear, one of the big arguments of our essay is that the failure to fight the root causes of crime shouldn't just be understood as a failure of the 1960s. A focus on the 1960s encourages a focus on one or two key actors or one or two administrations. That is a mistake. The underdevelopment of social policy in the United States is a persistent feature of American government since at least the 1930s, which is when the divergence in spending on social policy between the United States and the rest of the developed world becomes clear.\n\nIn fact, as I said already, the story of the rise in violence - not just the penal response to violence, but the rise in violence itself - is also, in some significant part, a story of the underdevelopment of American social democracy. In other words, if we'd had a labor movement that could have forced social policy in the United States through its own party, you might never have had something like the rise in crime and violence that you saw in the 1960s. By that, I mean that the social problems that lay behind the rise in violence may never have been allowed to fester as they did. It is an optimistic counterfactual, but it is far from an absurd one.\n\nBut how is it possible that the divergence begins in the 1930s - isn't that when the New Deal starts to make the Democratic Party look more like a social democratic party?\n\nThat's certainly true. There is an increase in spending over time. The United States in 1940 is spending more on social policy than it was in 1930, no question.\n\nBut here I am thinking about the contrast between the United States and Europe. As we show in our piece, it is between 1890 and 1930 that the gap between America and European countries first opens up. And that's because 1890 to 1930 is a period of massive tumult and agitation in Europe, from the growth of the European social democratic movement, revolutionary movements, the World War, massive working-class formation, strikes - that's the kind of turmoil that has no parallel in the United States.\n\nIt is that turmoil that I think explains this great divergence between the European countries and the United States.\n\nThe way our readers probably think of Great Society liberals like Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who famously wrote the Moynihan Report, is that his answer was a bunch of racist bullshit, since it's a narrative touted by conservatives like Rush Limbaugh all the time.\n\nThere is a great book on the Moynihan Report and its reception, which has a wonderful essay by civil rights leader Bayard Rustin. The point that Rustin makes about the report is that, in its analysis, it is basically social democratic. Rustin criticizes the report for not being more explicit about the policies it would recommend, but he specifically defends Moynihan from the charge that the report was racist. He argues that, in Moynihan's analysis, the root cause of violence and disorder is obviously economic. Causality runs first from mass unemployment and poverty to family breakdown and then whatever problems follow from that.\n\nIt's worth remembering, after all, that the Moynihan of the mid-1960s helped write LBJ's famous address at Howard University, which ends in a call for jobs, homes, welfare, and health care. That's way to the left of anything a centrist Democrat would say today. I'd take the 1960s Moynihan over Joe Biden any day.\n\nAnother one of your criticisms of the New Jim Crow thesis and others like it is that the idea that our carceral state was built by federal actors is just wrong.\n\nYes. In some ways, this is the biggest mistake that those books you cited earlier by Elizabeth Hinton and Naomi Murakawa make, which is that they make the story of mass incarceration entirely a story of what was happening inside presidential administrations and the federal government. Really, the story of mass incarceration is written at the state and local levels. It is a story of what happens at the state and local levels, because these are the governments that made most of the relevant legislation, that housed most of the prisoners, and that funded most of the police. The federal government matters to penal policy, but only at the margins.\n\nNote that this is not the same as saying that the federal government doesn't matter. It does, but in a complicated way. It is important, but not because it is the agent of mass incarceration, as these books imply. Rather, the federal government matters because it is only the federal government that has the fiscal authority to advance aggressive, social policy solutions to the problem of violence.\n\nSo the way we tell the story is this: when the federal government failed - for all of these long, deep, enduring historical reasons - to fight the rise in violence with social policy, it fell to local and state officials to do something about crime. After all, as we show in the piece, a lot of these officials (DAs, sheriffs, judges, state legislators) are democratically elected, and their constituents were panicking about crime. They had to do something about it if they were to be electable.\n\nAnd, at the local and state level, it's just impossible to fight crime and violence with social policy. Social democracy is just far too expensive for localities, and so it falls to these authorities to fight the rise in crime with the penal tools at their disposal instead.\n\nWhy can't a municipality or state in this country do their own full employment program and do their own welfare state?\n\nObviously, the basic reason that they can't is the same one that I gave earlier, which is that the underdeveloped character of the labor movement in the United States makes it very difficult to redistribute from rich to poor. That applies as much to localities as it does to the national scene. But there are some additional reasons that are very important here.\n\nOne reason has to do with compositional facts about where the rich live and where the poor live. Crime concentrates in poor areas, but the rich don't live in those areas. The rich live elsewhere. And so, if you're looking at a poor locality, like a Ferguson, Missouri, the mayor of Ferguson can't tax rich people living in St. Louis, let alone rich people living in San Francisco or in New York, to fund social programs in Ferguson. At the local level, what governments are dealing with is always tight budgets, very little money. And when you have very little money, you cannot fight crime at its roots - fighting crime at its roots takes massive amounts of investment.\n\nThis is really the critical point. As we explain in the piece, fighting crime in punitive ways is relatively inexpensive because it means fighting crime in a hyper-targeted way - governments arrest, charge, convict, and imprison only a small fraction of poor people. And, whatever the outcome, the penal arms of the state deal with them only over a short period of their life. Social programs, on the other hand, are investments in all poor people (and sometimes, to be politically feasible, all people) for a much larger duration of time. They are thus much more expensive, as we explain in the piece. The United States has the largest penal state in world history and the stingiest welfare state in the advanced world, but it still spends anywhere from four to twelve times what it spends on penal policy on social policy. Localities just don't have enough tax revenue.\n\nThe second reason that localities find it difficult is that they have to worry that rich people will run away with their money. They'll either hide it or they'll stop investing or whatever else. This is true for all states in capitalist societies in general, but the problem is much more acute at the local level, since the costs of exit for rich people at the local level are so low. If you're in charge of a city government, and you're thinking about raising taxes on rich people, well, rich people can just jump across jurisdictional lines and flee to the suburbs, and then you're stuck. And so that problem is much more acute at the local level than at the national level, because the costs of fleeing the local state are much lower than the cost of fleeing the national state.\n\nI want to get back to the 1960s moment, because you have a really shocking quote from Martin Luther King, Jr, after the Watts riots - he's enraged about the police for not doing enough to fight crime before the riots. In your piece, you and Clegg mention the professionalization of police forces in the 1960s recommended by liberals, when today's activists tend to view such changes as reactionary. You seem to be arguing that a lot of that professionalization was progressive.\n\nWell, one way of thinking about it is that the only thing worse than being policed by paid professionals is being policed by underpaid amateurs. And that was the story in the 1950s and the 1960s - the police were brutal. So there was no shortage of legitimate grievances that required very significant reforms of policing.\n\nAlongside that, however, was the view that King was articulating, which was the view that crime was a massive, growing problem. Not especially for rich, white Americans, but for the poor and disproportionately black communities in which crime concentrated. Residents of those communities were extremely upset about rising crime and violence. This is clear if you look at public opinion polls, as we do in our piece. Recent histories of Washington, DC, and Harlem over this period also show that residents were enraged about the level of crime and violence. Their most common complaint was not about over-policing, per se, although over-policing was also a problem and has become much more of a problem as the carceral state has grown. But one of the most common complaints in this period was one of under-protection by the police, the systematic and racist under-protection and neglect of these communities.\n\nThis is something that I think the Left needs to understand. It is possible to complain both about heavy-handed policing and about under-policing and under-protection. Because even today, there is a lot of very serious violence in the United States. St. Louis is, today, the fifteenth most violent city in the world. A program of \"prison and police abolition\" makes a lot of sense in a world in which you think crime is fictitious and concocted by racist politicians. But it makes much less sense in the world in which we live.\n\nThere are a few reasons we don't think much about this today. First, crime has declined massively in the United States. It's not an issue that dominates American politics in the way that it did in the 1980s and '90s. The other reason is arguably that most of the academic left is composed of relatively well-off people in gentrifying cities who don't have firsthand experience of this kind of crime and violence anymore. This has hampered our ability to think credibly about police reform. No doubt, reform is urgent. Policing in America is barbaric. But reform must address issues of over-policing and under-protection.\n\nSo what did Black Lives Matter get right, and what did they get wrong?\n\nWhat Black Lives Matter (BLM) gets right is that American criminal justice today is degrading and inhumane. It is punitive in the extreme. I think that BLM has the right indictment of the way in which we do criminal justice. We live in the largest police state the world has ever seen, and that should scandalize all of us. BLM has been instrumental in bringing that to people's attention.\n\nWhat activists associated with BLM often miss is that the problem of the overdevelopment of the American penal state is intimately linked to the problem of violence, and thus to the under development of the American welfare state. It is the underdevelopment of social policy that explains both high levels of interpersonal violence and the brutally violent state response to it. So they are absolutely right that there needs to be a reform program aimed at the criminal justice system. But we must also transform how we do social policy in the United States. In other words, we need a reform program that responds not just to the fact that people are brutalized by police and prisons, but also to the fact that people have legitimate grievances about high levels of violence.\n\nBut the problem you run into is that, if you take everything you just said, and you go to the American Left and say, \"The solution to our huge carceral state is to vote Bernie Sanders and support the labor movement,\" at the end of the day, a person who wanted to argue with you could look at American prisons and correctly point out that black people are 12 percent of the general population - but they're an enormous part of the prison population. So how could the solution be that simple?\n\nYes, that is a great question. To be clear, the questioner is absolutely right to identify the racial disparity in mass incarceration as one of its most significant and outrageous features. One of the things that makes American mass incarceration such a blot on American civilization is its combination of severity and inequality. Because it is both so severe and so racially unequal, you see statistics like the fact that something like 33 percent of African American men born in a certain period will go to prison over their lifetime. Prison becomes a normal event for a certain demographic.\n\nSo the questioner is absolutely right that mass incarceration is, in some ways, defined by racial injustice. Now, the intuitive way that one would wage war against this kind of racial disparity is to argue that we should eliminate racism inside the criminal justice system. The criminal justice system exhibits these racial disparities, so let's do away with racism at each stage of the criminal justice process. Let's do away with racist police, let's do away with racist prosecutors, let's do away with racist juries, let's do away with racist judges, let's do away with racist prison guards, et cetera.\n\nBut the problem is that, in a world in which we did away with all racism inside the criminal justice system - and, to be clear, that racism does exist; there's lots of evidence that similarly situated black and white offenders are treated differently - even in that world, racial disparities would still be outrageous. That's because something like 70 to 75 percent of the racial disparity is explained by racial inequality in the life course before people make contact with the criminal justice system. Because African Americans live in America's worst neighborhoods and at the bottom of its class structure, they are more likely to commit crime than white Americans. A reform program that says nothing about that fact and speaks only about racism inside the criminal justice system will render leftists ineffective warriors against racial disparities in punishment.\n\nWhat you just said is a very controversial statement - so controversial that, for many people on the Left, if they hear that, they'll reject it out of hand, or suspect you're pushing some reactionary political vision. That's a major barrier to getting the Left on board.\n\nFair enough. Let's take this in three stages. The first stage is an evidentiary stage: What evidence do we have that this is true? The second stage is an analytical stage: What explains it? And the third stage is a normative stage: What do we do about it?\n\nSo, the first question, which is a very good question, is: How do we know that this is true? How do we know that African Americans are overrepresented in the ranks of criminal offenders? The reason this is a really good question is because we know that police are racist. So, as many academics say, we should be skeptical of crime data that suggests that African Americans commit more crime than do white Americans. That's a totally reasonable worry. If, say, police decide to patrol more in certain African American neighborhoods and less in white neighborhoods, we'll observe that African Americans commit more crime, even if underlying levels of offenses are the same. Or, if they deliberately tend to apprehend black offenders but not white offenders, we'd observe a racial disparity that doesn't reflect differences in behavior. So it's right to worry about the reliability of police data.\n\nAs we explain in the article, what criminologists do to deal with that difficulty is that they cross-check police statistics against statistics we get from other sources. Primarily, we have two other ways of estimating racial disparities in crime commission. The first is through victimization surveys. These are surveys of people who have been victims of crime. The racial disparities that we estimate from these surveys are not that different from the racial disparities we get from police data. The second way is to look at mortality statistics. So, we can look at people who have been victims of homicides. And because we know that most homicides are intraracial, we can use the victimization disparity, which is the ratio of black Americans who have been victims of homicides and compare it to white Americans who've been victims of homicide, and use that disparity as an estimate of the disparity in violent offending. That disparity is also similar to the disparity we estimate from police data.\n\nOur best academic work on this subject suggests that the racial disparity is real in an evidentiary sense: most (but not all) of the observed racial disparity in arrests, convictions, and incarceration reflects actual racial disparities in offending.\n\nOnce we've established that racial disparity is real - that it is a fact rather than simply a concoction of racist policing - we have to ask the second question: What explains it? As I have argued already, and as we argue in the piece, African Americans live disproportionately in neighborhoods in which poverty is highly concentrated, in which jobs are scarce, schools and housing are subpar, and community institutions are under-resourced. It is this inequality that explains disparities in crime. Crime is an index of oppression. Racial disparities in crime are an index of racial disparities in oppression.\n\nWe can then ask a third question, which is a normative question: What should we do about it? What is the right policy response? I think the reason that people find the issue of crime so challenging to talk about is because they're unable to disentangle these three very different questions.\n\nSo many people on the Left seem to believe that simply to note the fact of racial disparities in crime is to have argued that impoverished racial minorities are to blame for these disparities. And so, because we want at all costs to avoid victim blaming (or, worse, justifying mass incarceration), we ignore racial disparities in crime.\n\nBut this is preposterously bad normative reasoning! Simply noting the fact of racial disparities in crime does not commit you to victim blaming or to supporting mass incarceration. That requires additional arguments, which we reject. In fact, if you take our analysis seriously, our view is that there is only one reasonable response to racial disparities in crime, and that is to demand that the state tackle the racial inequalities that are its root cause, rather than to tackle it punitively once it manifests as crime.\n\nSo, to that activist who's thinking, \"Look, maybe you're right and the current lefty view on this stuff is incorrect or incomplete. But is it really that important to get right?\" Why can't they just nod along with other activists who say the problem is enduring white supremacy and a racist criminal justice system? You're potentially asking them to alienate a lot of people.\n\nIf these activists are serious about tackling the injustice of American mass incarceration, then they have to take seriously the root causes of that problem. If you want to change the world, you have to interpret it correctly first.\n\nTake the example we were discussing earlier. If we are serious about undoing the enormous, scandalous, black-white racial disparity in incarceration rates, we have to take seriously the fact that this is mostly a consequence of racial inequality outside the criminal justice system rather than inside the criminal justice system. No amount of implicit bias training, minority hiring programs, et cetera, will get the job done.\n\nSo, my message to these activists is that it is much more important to be right than to be favorably retweeted. This is far too important an issue to be treated as a popularity contest.\n\nOkay, so if it's beyond just racial disparities, can you tell me what American incarceration looks like now for white Americans?\n\nWell, American incarceration rates are extreme for white Americans as well. They're extreme by any reasonable standard. The rate of white incarceration in America is higher than the incarceration rate in any European country. And so, in this sense, white Americans also live under a historically barbaric penal state.\n\nWhat does incarceration look like in a state like Idaho, which is almost entirely white?\n\nRight, Idaho has a very high incarceration rate! It's maybe a little over the national average of about 700 people per 100,000. Even if it were its own country, it would be on par with the United States and one of the most barbaric states, in these terms, in world history.\n\nThis certainly flies in the face of a lot of the narratives.\n\nIt certainly poses a problem for the narrative that American incarceration is a system of racialized social control. Such a large share of the population that suffers American penal excess is white. This is much more than simply \"collateral damage.\"\n\nAnd remember two things. First, as we describe in the piece, racial disparities in punishment both increased and then decreased during the era of mass incarceration. In that sense, the era of mass incarceration is not defined by rising racial disparities. In fact, what changed most dramatically over this period were class disparities.\n\nSecond, it's not true that rates of incarceration have increased for all classes of African Americans. They've increased dramatically - extremely dramatically - for very poor African Americans in particular. But they've actually gone down for college-educated African Americans between 1970 and the present. In this sense, a certain fraction of the African American community has escaped the worst consequences of mass incarceration.\n\nWell, what about the \"police don't check your class card\" response?\n\nIt has some truth to it. All else equal, a black person is much more likely to be harassed by the police than a white person is. Of course. There is a lot of good social scientific evidence that policing is marked by all kinds of racial disparities.\n\nBut this is different from arguing there are no class disparities in policing. There are, and they are quite pronounced.\n\nPartly, this is because policing is so neighborhood-based. For instance, stop-and-frisk is, above all else, a program to saturate certain high-violence neighborhoods with police, with some terrible consequences for the residents of those areas. Of course, if you can escape these neighborhoods, you can also escape much of the awful consequences of policing in these neighborhoods.\n\nAnother way of putting this is that the more severe the penal outcome we are discussing - say, from a spectrum of police harassment to actual imprisonment - the less true this statement is. So, someone like Henry Louis Gates can be harassed and even arrested in his own home. And that is a scandal, of course. But as Gates himself said in a recent interview, his experience was, in the end, nothing like the experience of those who have less class and status than he does.\n\nThat is a decent summary of the story of the last fifty years of American criminal justice. As the carceral state has grown, the burden of its punitiveness has fallen very disproportionately on the poor and not the rich.\n\nAt the end of the article, you mention that the American liberal left is beginning to sound more like the American right in terms of punishment. And one of the things you talk about is the \"victim's rights\" movement. Can you explain what you mean by that, and why that is a problem?\n\nLet me first just say something sociological about this talk of \"victim's rights\" among progressives. And then I'll say something about how I think we should deal with it.\n\nI think the reason that it's been common to hear this kind of talk from progressives is because the American left has bought the standard story about mass incarceration. And in that standard story, people who are in American prisons are mostly not really guilty of anything. Maybe they are guilty of smoking or dealing a little weed, but they're not really guilty of anything very severe. And, as a consequence, you can be both a prison abolitionist and also extremely punitive about serious forms of crime - you can hold those two positions simultaneously.\n\nHowever, once you understand that American prisons are actually full of people who have committed serious offenses, you have to rethink either your criticism of American mass incarceration or your punitiveness. The American left has not yet had to think this through, because we are still in the thrall of the standard story.\n\nNow, I think we should still be committed to the position that American mass incarceration is barbaric. But to do this, once we dispense with the standard story, we will have to rethink our punitiveness. We will have to rethink how a state should deal with offenders who have done terrible things to other people.\n\nWhat we argue throughout the article is that if somebody is committing a serious crime, this is typically a consequence of the fact that the state and society have failed that person over the course of their lives. The right thing to do would have been to address those deficits by means of social policy. That's a start, but it's not a sufficient answer to the problem, because there will always be people who commit serious offenses. We should have something to say about what the state should do about these people. I worry that many activists haven't really thought about this problem.\n\nSo how should we think about it? The short answer is that we should think about crime as a kind of public health problem. The state has an obligation to protect victims, of course. It has a duty to protect people from both present and future crimes. This establishes cause for incapacitation and confinement. But the state also has a duty to offenders. It must respect their rights. So it only has the right to confine them in the least punitive way possible, and it must always do so with an eye to their rehabilitation and release as soon as is feasible.\n\nAs with many other institutions, the American left finds itself looking to the Nordic countries on this question: they have the very lowest incarceration rates in the world. But I want to ask you, do they achieve this by policies that would be hard for Americans to swallow - even the American liberal left?\n\nWhat the Nordics do very well is that they attack crime at its roots by means of social policy - through social democracy. Now, that is not very controversial or tough for the American left to endorse. But what the Nordics also do is that they treat offenders like human beings with significant rights and freedoms that are not surrendered when they commit a crime. Unsurprisingly, rates of recidivism in the Nordic system are significantly lower than rates of recidivism in the American system.\n\nNow, one of the things that we have to note about this is that the Nordics spend much more per prisoner than the United States. A system of humane incarceration would actually be a system in which we spent much more on prisoners - in which we attended to the various problems that have led them to crime. It would be a system in which we treat them like human beings rather than denounce them for the awful things that they've done.\n\nBut politicians here can argue that, sure, our system might be brutal - but it keeps murderers and rapists from committing crimes again by just locking them up and throwing away the key. In Nordic countries, there are no life sentences - they get back out. How do we even begin to make that case to the public?\n\nIt's a question that the American right posed to the public very effectively as crime was rising. The Right was able to argue something to the American public that liberals didn't manage to counter. But ultimately, the progressive response to this kind of argument requires an affirmation of the idea that if we invest resources in people, if we invest in their rehabilitation, if we invest in their physical and mental health care, if we invest in giving them opportunities upon return, we have little to fear.\n\nIt amounts to an affirmation of the rehabilitative ideal. This ideal came under severe attack in American policy-making circles - there's been no alternative to the punitive view for a long time. The progressive position has to be an affirmation of exactly the opposite view - that there is an alternative. It may, in fact, be an expensive alternative, but so be it. We must take from the rich and give to the poor. We must invest in the lives of the poor and the oppressed in ways that we do not do. This is the way forward.\n\nAdaner Usmani is an assistant professor of sociology and social studies at Harvard University and a Catalyst editorial board member.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But as small-town economies have declined, county jails have expanded - and rural incarceration rates have jumped dramatically.\n\nJail cells in Caldwell County Jail in Lockhart, Texas.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen the coal industry dried up in Kentucky, the state's criminal justice policies helped subsidize impoverished counties by trucking money (and prisoners) to county jails. The result was a sharp rise in county jail populations - a 39 percent increase between 2008 and 2016. As researchers Jack Norton and Judah Schept have pointed out, if Kentucky's jail incarceration rate were to continue to rise as it has since 2000, it would only take 113 years before every single Kentuckian was locked up.\n\nKentucky provides just one example of a much larger national trend. For decades, many people thought of mass incarceration as a disproportionately urban problem, with major cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles contributing the lion's share of new arrests and prison commitments. But in reality, it's thousands of smaller cities and towns that suffer the highest incarceration rates today.\n\nAcross the United States' rural and deindustrialized landscape, economic decline has gone hand in hand with jail expansion and increased incarceration. And as county jails increasingly turn to the federal government for revenue - including by detaining immigrants on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) - the problem is only becoming more pronounced.\n\nThe In Our Backyards project , a research initiative from the Vera Institute of Justice, was launched to capture this shifting geography of mass incarceration in real time. This project has taken researchers all over the country, from Pennsylvania's disinvested steel region to the desert towns of southern Colorado, to monitor the nationwide buildup in carceral infrastructure and connect with local anti-jail organizers. Jacobin 's Jonah Walters spoke with researcher Jack Norton and campaign director Jasmine Heiss about the social costs of county jail expansion and the problem of jail incarceration in small communities.\n\nIn your recent Guardian op-ed , you drew attention to a facet of rural America that is generally left out of mainstream media accounts: the massive buildup of carceral infrastructure in rural counties over the past several decades.\n\nWhy is mass incarceration key to understanding life in rural America?\n\nThe immediate reason for the op-ed was the release of the People in Jail report by a team of our colleagues at the Vera Institute of Justice, with other researchers. The study shows that jail incarceration in rural counties has risen 27 percent since 2013, while urban incarceration - what we call \"big city\" incarceration - actually declined 18 percent during that period.\n\nAcross the country, county after county is building newer and bigger jails. In many cases, those jails are fulfilling functions that used to be fulfilled by state or federal prisons. In a state like Kentucky , for example, the state is sending people serving state prison sentences to county facilities, driving jail expansion. As a result, people are starting to serve out longer sentences in jails.\n\nCounty jails are also increasingly being used for ICE detention. That's something we're seeing all over the county - county jails incarcerating immigrants on behalf of federal agencies.\n\nThere are nearly eighteen times more admissions to jails each year than to prisons. In the United States, someone is booked into jail 11 million times each year - that's an astronomical number. The People in Jail report reveals that jail incarceration has actually been rising steeply since its most recent low in 2015. That naturally begs the question: Why are people in small places getting put behind bars more and more?\n\nTo really understand rural incarceration, you have to situate this rebounding jail population in the context of everything that's happening outside of the jail doors. We're coming to see incarceration as something that happens in the wake of economic collapse, whether it's through the loss of local industries or the decline of state funding to localities.\n\nThere is an inextricable link between rising incarceration, on the one hand, and economic abandonment and decline in small communities, on the other.\n\nHow has the overdose crisis contributed to rising incarceration in rural counties?\n\nWe need to frame the question differently. Incarceration has fueled the overdose crisis. Recent research has shown that the two major predictors of rising overdose rates in a county are economic decline and jail incarceration. In a typical county, the jail incarceration rate has a bigger effect on rates of overdose than even the opioid prescription rate. We need to start looking at jailing not as a response to poverty, drug addiction, and widespread despair, but as a cause of those problems.\n\nThis has come up in our fieldwork. In Binghamton, New York , for example, which is in a county with one of the highest incarceration rates in the state, people have been organizing against the expansion of the jail's purview, and organizers there understand quite well that incarceration kills people.\n\nFor one thing, there are people dying in the jail. But there's also the fact that using jail as a response to drug problems not only exacerbates those problems on a social level, but actually causes overdoses for individuals. People with substance use disorders go into the jail, they receive little to no treatment to help them recover from addiction, they lose some of the tolerance they had built up as regular drug users, and then when they return to the streets they overuse and overdose, resulting in death. This is a well-documented phenomenon across the country. Jail incarceration is actively contributing to the overdose crisis, rather than simply responding to it.\n\nThe notion that we're bringing a more compassionate and public health-oriented approach to the overdose crisis doesn't hold up. Our response has really been punishment and control, sometimes packaged in public health language.\n\nWhen you look closely at who is in jail, you see increasing punitiveness for crimes related to substance use, especially around low-level dealers. For example, in several Pennsylvania counties (and in other states as well), cases of drug delivery resulting in death are routinely prosecuted as homicides . People who share drugs are being held accountable for people around them dying. In Indiana, the most prevalent felony filings are possession of meth and syringe possession. And even the ostensibly progressive solutions of drug courts and other so-called problem-solving courts betray an enduring fixation on punishment and control. These kinds of solutions are driven by the same logic that allows people to applaud the massive expansion of electronic monitoring as a supposedly de-carceral measure that creates a \"gentler\" system.\n\nHow are county jails different from state or federal prisons, and what does mass incarceration actually look like at the county level?\n\nJails are a key part of the infrastructure of social control and criminalization in the United States. They're a major piece of that infrastructure at the county level. Above the county jail system, you have the state prison system, and then you also have the federal prison system and various immigration detention centers around the country.\n\nThere's still a lot to learn about what's going on at the county level. How do you capture a system of mass incarceration that is actually more than three thousand local systems all across the country?\n\nWe've done fieldwork for this project in California, rural Colorado , Florida , Georgia , rural Indiana , Kentucky , New York , Pennsylvania , Texas, and other states as well. If you travel the country and stay on the lookout for new or expanded jails, you see county after county increasing its capacity to lock people up. We're witnessing a massive increase of carceral infrastructure across the landscape of the rural United States. It's staggering.\n\nThe key distinction between jail populations and prison populations is that the vast majority of people in jail on any given day are unconvicted - they are awaiting sentencing or disposition of a charge or charges that haven't been proven. Jail incarceration is increasingly being used to \"manage\" people, especially those who have been accused of violating the terms of their supervision (probation or parole).\n\nSeveral states house significant portions of their state prison populations in county jails. In some states, you increasingly have people serving multi-year sentences at the county jail level. Oftentimes, this comes with the promise of revenue from the state system, which counties use to offset the cost of detaining people.\n\nThe expansion of jail capacity you describe is taking place even as many state governments boast about reductions in prison populations at the state level. How is it that, in many states, bipartisan prison reforms coexist with jail expansion?\n\nI think we have to look at the system of mass criminalization as holistically as possible. We also need to understand that changes to this system unfold through a process of co-optation, repression, and struggle. If you examine reforms closely, you often end up feeling like you're watching a shell game , in which the crisis moves continually to a different scale or to a different level of government. We're seeing that now in the expansion of county jails.\n\nIn Indiana, for example, former governor Mike Pence signed House Bill 1006 in 2015, which was designed to reduce the number of people in state prison by housing people convicted of low-level felonies in county jails or putting them on local supervision like probation or electronic monitoring. What the policy actually did was move certain people from Indiana's state prison system into county jails, while also hardening sentences for certain state prisoners. The state prison population dropped a little bit, then went right back up (very predictably). But the legislation's major effect was to cause a crisis at the county level, by creating an influx of new people into jails in Indiana. As a result, county after county after county in Indiana started to build bigger jails.\n\nThis was an example of bipartisan prison reform. But what was the end result? An even more vast infrastructure of incarceration across Indiana. Forty percent of Indiana counties planned or broke ground on new jail construction projects, according to an Indiana Sheriffs' Association estimate . Infrastructure doesn't just go away after a new election. Generations of people are going to pay for and live with and be incarcerated in those jails.\n\nYou mentioned ICE detention. How does the federal government, and especially federal immigrant detention, contribute to county jail expansion?\n\nLocal counties receive revenue - called a \"per diem\" - for every day that their jail holds somebody for the federal government. If you're a sheriff or a county commissioner, holding prisoners for a federal agency gets you a revenue stream. This applies to the US marshals, who hold people in local county jails after arrest and during transport, and it also applies to ICE.\n\nThis situation has given many counties an incentive to build bigger jails , since they can offset the cost of that investment by housing more and more federal or state prisoners. The end result of this devolution has been the quiet jail boom we're seeing across the country. The United States Department of Agriculture even provides financial assistance for jail expansion in some counties.\n\nFederal per diems provide a partial explanation for widespread jail expansion, but they're not the whole story. In states where corrections departments hold people at the county level, like Louisiana and Kentucky, that revenue comes from the state government, not the federal one.\n\nBuilding up that infrastructure creates and reinforces political alignments, and it contributes to a carceral common sense about what's in the \"best interest\" of the county.\n\nIf you create an ever-deepening reliance on the detention of immigrants and other people facing federal charges to offset the costs of pre-trial detention, then you will lock more people up before trial as long as there are beds and dollars available. It will be in the \"best interest\" of your county to sustain a local system of punishment that relies on incarcerating some people to generate revenue, which offsets the cost of even more incarceration.\n\nThis creates a situation in which people who should absolutely never be thinking about immigration enforcement - county sheriffs, county commissioners - suddenly see immigrant detention as a tool for economic survival, or at least as a valuable source of revenue that balances out other policy decisions being made locally.\n\nYou mentioned the connection between economic decline - whether through deindustrialization or reductions in state assistance - and rising incarceration. How does jail expansion affect economic development in small places?\n\nIf a small rural county decides to build a new jail, that's likely going to be the most significant investment in infrastructure the county makes for a long time, because there's only so much debt you can go into. If you put 30 million dollars into a new jail, that precludes other investment in social infrastructure to deal with the actual problems that jails not only don't solve, but make worse - things like poverty, mental illness, and drug use.\n\nAfter an initial investment in the jail, the jail becomes the key piece of infrastructure through which other investments are made. If the county identifies a need for mental health services, for example, that becomes a call to put a mental health wing in the jail. If the county sees the need for drug treatment or counseling in the community, it establishes a drug rehabilitation program in the jail. Investments in county-level carceral infrastructure are political investments. They affect what policymakers imagine to be possible.\n\nI see it when I do this fieldwork. It's like I'm not just traveling around to study jails, but that I'm doing a tour of post-2008 recession America. After all these cuts, oftentimes the only part of the local state that has any resources left is the sheriff's department.\n\nIt's a kind of carceral austerity.\n\nIt's a carceral austerity that's self-created, in many cases.\n\nBudgets and policies are not just technocratic. They're moral documents. They reveal so much about how state and county governments see the humanity of the people who live there.\n\nBecause of the legacy of siting state and federal prisons in rural communities as a part of an empty promise of \"economic salvation\" organized by state and federal authorities and local elites, I think there's often an immediate assumption that jails are also built as a jobs program, to enlist the working poor in the project of mass incarceration. Even leaving aside the dubious economic impact of prison construction and the dehumanization inherent to working in a prison, jails require a fundamentally different frame.\n\nAlthough smaller jails increasingly house people for state and federal governments, the overwhelming majority of people in a local jail on a given day are generally from the very same community in which the jail is located. You have a small number of people charged with managing and punishing people whom they've often known their entire life. A colleague once described an overcrowded North East Pennsylvania jail as a place where the guards were being paid to \"torture their own family members.\"\n\nAt the local scale, the cost of generations of investment into carceral infrastructure becomes even clearer. People who work at the jail are also driving to work on the county's crumbling roads, they're sending their kids to underfunded schools, or they're watching their own family members land in jail for poverty or substance use. And they're being told, over and over again, that a newer, bigger jail is the most legitimate investment of public dollars - that it's the only thing that will produce safety. And in some cases, even as the local commissioners and sheriff pursue ever-expanding jails, they can't adequately staff the facilities they're currently running.\n\nWhen we shift our focus away from state corrections departments and toward a decentralized network of jail systems administered by county sheriffs, the task of organizing against mass incarceration starts to seem even more daunting.\n\nWhat kinds of challenges does the trend toward jail incarceration present for reformers?\n\nOne thing that comes to mind is the incredible proximity of the people who work in the system and the people who live in the county. I've seen editorials written about anti-jail organizers in local papers, calling them obstructionists or accusing them of not caring about the well-being of the county or the people in the jail. There's a level of social risk and social vulnerability that comes with being a voice that challenges the status quo in a small place.\n\nOf course, that also means that you have the social proximity to build much closer relationships and find points of leverage. Most of the people who actually execute the justice system - not necessarily probation or parole officers, but certainly sheriffs, judges, district attorneys, and county commissioners - are elected. In terms of organizing, that provides a real opportunity for holding people accountable and articulating local visions of safety that do not rely on intensified incarceration.\n\nThe fundamental objective, however, needs to be shifting resources outside of the justice system. We don't want to be in the position of constantly demanding that the already bloated criminal justice bureaucracy establish new and better programs for reducing harm. In reality, we should be pushing elected officials to put resources elsewhere so that people never end up entangled with the criminal justice system.\n\nI think one of the things that's so important about this project is pointing out to people that if you see mass incarceration as a local issue - \"In Our Backyards,\" as our framing goes - you see it also as something that it is possible to organize around locally. To a large extent, mass incarceration is the result of decisions made by local politicians who you elect.\n\nThe most remarkable part of this story is that, even in places that are perpetually described as sad and self-defeating, people are organizing to resist jail expansion and punitive carceral policies.\n\nEven in small places, where there are such high social costs for organizers, where local justice practitioners and \"system stakeholders\" have a tremendous amount of power, people are pushing back. They are fighting jail construction tirelessly, year after year.\n\nGiven the shifting geography of mass incarceration, what do we need to keep in mind moving forward?\n\nTo start, I want to acknowledge that in some places we have seen some incredible wins, often sustained by movement work and organizing. For example, the city jail in Atlanta recently closed as a result of successful organizing around a number of issues - such as decriminalizing municipal-level offenses, eliminating the city's ICE contracts, and bail and pre-trial detention reform. Now, advocates and activists are actually working to transform that jail site into a facility that serves the community. That's a momentous win, and it's not the only one. I wouldn't want to erase the progress that has been made. But criminal justice reform has been extremely uneven - things look different county by county and state by state.\n\nWe need to look at what's happening elsewhere. We pay so much attention to big cities like Atlanta that we too often end up characterizing much of the rest of the country as a vast land of defeat. But in deindustrialized small cities and rural counties, people are still fighting really tenaciously against jail expansion and often being personally attacked for doing so.\n\nI'm from a rural area of upstate New York. Since the 2016 election, we've seen all kinds of articles about \"what's wrong with rural America,\" and they almost invariably paint rural places as vivid Boschian hellscapes. Almost all of these portraits ignore the fact that incarceration rates are rising. More and more people are getting locked up and criminalized in rural areas. That can't be left out of the story anymore.\n\nWhat I want people to realize is that incarceration is actually a technology of the immiseration and premature death that we see in all those bleak portraits of rural America. I want people to understand that mass incarceration is a rural issue. It's an element of deindustrialization, just as it's an element of the semifeudal racist status quo in some counties in the South.\n\nCounty jails exist to produce and reproduce social relations of a certain kind. As the work of Ruth Wilson Gilmore demonstrates, mass incarceration is part of the making and remaking of rural and urban political and economic landscapes through new combinations and relationships. To understand this at the local scale demands that we apply class analysis to rural counties. When we're talking about jail construction, we're really talking about certain class fractions winning control over state resources and using them toward carceral ends, in a very organized way.\n\nIf we want to contribute to this fight, a first step is refusing to see rural places as homogenous. Rural America isn't all white, and rural America has class variation. We need to understand that there is class struggle happening there.\n\nJasmine Heiss is the campaign director for the In Our Backyards project at the Vera Institute of Justice.\n\nJack Norton is a researcher at the Vera Institute's Center on Sentencing and Corrections.\n\nJonah Walters is a researcher at Jacobin and a graduate student in geography at Rutgers University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Wasted Funds, Destroyed Property: How Sheriffs Undermined Their Successors After Losing Reelection\n\nSheriff at the courthouse in a town road in South Carolina Pgiam/Getty\n\nThis story was originally published by ProPublica, which produced the article in partnership with AL.com , a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network .\n\nShortly after Phil Sims became the sheriff of Marshall County, Alabama, at 12 a.m. on Jan. 14, he found a cardboard box in a storage closet containing five government-issued smartphones, each with multiple holes drilled clear through them.\n\nIt was the first time Sims had been allowed to enter the sheriff's office, a red-brick building overlooking Lake Guntersville, a foggy bass-fishing mecca, since he defeated longtime Sheriff J. Scott Walls in the June primary election.\n\nIt didn't take long for Sims to learn that the destroyed iPhones and Androids had belonged to his predecessor and his top brass. Sims also discovered that the hard drives had been removed from the computers in his and his chief deputy's offices, and reams of records were nowhere to be found.\n\nThe records Walls did leave behind revealed that in the months following his electoral loss, he was wired tens of thousands of dollars from the sheriff's office's general fund, and more than $30,000 was missing from its commissary fund. The records, which were reviewed by AL.com and ProPublica , show that the sheriff's office spent tens of thousands of public dollars on expenditures that Sims described as unnecessary and excessive, including over 20,000 rolls of toilet paper, hundreds of boxes of garbage bags and 10 massive drums of dishwashing liquid.\n\nDonald Rhea, a lawyer for Walls, didn't respond to repeated emailed requests for comment on a detailed list of claims made by Sims. Walls' wife declined to connect a reporter with her husband and hung up the phone, and Walls did not respond to text and voice messages left at multiple numbers listed as his in public records.\n\nSims is not the only new sheriff who accused his predecessor of taking advantage of the power of his office as his term wound down. In fact, his predicament is just one example of a dubious but little-known tradition of Alabama sheriffs hobbling those who defeat them at the polls.\n\nAL.com and ProPublica interviewed nine of the 10 new sheriffs who won elections against incumbents last year. All nine said that last-minute actions by their predecessors had negative impacts on their offices and, by extension, the public. A captain in the office of the tenth, Jefferson County Sheriff Mark Pettway, said there were no problems during his transition.\n\nMany of the sheriffs alleged that their predecessors acted in ways that could be described as vindictive hazing: One failed to have a badge made for the new sheriff; another threw all the sheriff's office's unmarked keys in a pile, leaving his replacement to figure out which went to which door or vehicle.\n\nBut seven of the sheriffs made more serious accusations against their predecessors, many of which were corroborated by internal office records. Among their claims: Outgoing sheriffs pocketed public money, fudged financial reports, wasted sheriff's office funds and destroyed or stole public property.\n\nThe findings are part of a yearlong examination by AL.com and ProPublica into how Alabama sheriffs are overseen and the vast county-by-county disparities in how they execute their duties and enforce the law.\n\nAll the former sheriffs who responded to a reporter's inquiries denied wrongdoing, often insulting their successor or providing a counter-narrative aimed at disproving the claims.\n\nIn Alabama, sheriffs are the law beyond city limits, ruling over small towns, unincorporated farmlands and suburbs. Unlike police chiefs appointed by mayors and beholden to city councils, sheriffs answer to no one but the voters who elect them. State legislators and other county officials are typically unwilling to cross them.\n\nEvery day, the state's 67 sheriffs make decisions about what laws to enforce, what their deputies should focus on and who they should arrest. They run county jails, partner with the federal government and other agencies, and campaign to stay in office. Many of them oversee multimillion-dollar budgets, and every sheriff is largely responsible for deciding what county law enforcement activities taxpayers should pay for.\n\nLisa Graybill, deputy legal director for the Montgomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center, called for authorities to \"fully investigate whether any laws were broken\" by outgoing sheriffs after they were defeated in last year's elections. The SPLC has long studied sheriff's offices and other law enforcement agencies across the U.S., and it has sued sheriffs in several states, including Alabama, in recent years over alleged misconduct and abuse of power.\n\n\"At the very least, the conduct described and evidenced is a severe violation of the public's trust and at worst, may violate the law,\" Graybill said.\n\nAt least three sheriffs found ways to take home public money on their way out the door.\n\nLast year, AL.com reported that Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin pocketed more than $750,000 worth of funds initially allocated to purchase food for jail inmates between 2015 and 2017, and purchased a $740,000 beach house.\n\nSheriff's office financial documents recently obtained by ProPublica and AL.com via public record request show that in the six months after his June electoral loss, Entrekin personally received an additional $269,184 worth of checks from sheriff's office accounts. The records show that the money was initially allocated to feed federal immigration detainees and state and municipal inmates housed in the county jail.\n\nEntrekin did not respond to requests for comment via phone and text message, and Rhea, who is also his attorney, did not respond to emailed questions. Rhea instead provided a short statement denying new Sheriff Jonathon Horton's assertion that Entrekin refused to speak with him after the election.\n\nLast year, Entrekin said publicly that he had a legal right to leftover jail food funds under a Depression-era law. The state Legislature has since passed a law prohibiting sheriffs from keeping funds allocated to feed state inmates that they didn't use for that purpose.\n\nBut lawyers and law professors have said that Entrekin likely ran afoul of federal law by also keeping federal jail food money, as AL.com reported in December. In July, Entrekin told AL.com that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General was investigating his handling of inmate-feeding funds. No charges have been filed, and Rhea, Entrekin's lawyer, denied any misconduct at the time.\n\n\"He stands ready to cooperate fully and completely in the investigation that, hopefully, will begin immediately,\" Rhea, said in a July statement. \"That is what innocent people do.\"\n\nSix sheriffs say that they have requested state audits of their offices' finances and that they will decide how to proceed once they have the results in hand. The other three say they are handling the fallout themselves and want to avoid causing more bad blood.\n\n\"As far as criminal or unethical, we will see,\" Sims said. \"I've asked for an audit from the [Alabama Department of Examiners of Public Accounts] to address any issues.\"\n\nSheriff Blake Turman of Covington County said that he filed a complaint last month with the state Ethics Commission, which has not been previously reported, and that he also plans to submit a report to local prosecutors. Both are related to former Sheriff Dennis Meeks' spending during the transition period and what Turman alleges to be missing public funds and property. Meeks denies wrongdoing.\n\nThough other public officials in Alabama often face growing pains and hostile staffs after displacing incumbents, sheriffs are especially vulnerable to the whims of their predecessors. Sheriffs wield far greater power than most other elected officials to spend public funds as they see fit, and they are subject to far less oversight.\n\nIn Marshall County, Sims' first priority when he became sheriff wasn't finances. It was feeding the hundreds of people in the jail one floor below his office. The jailhouse kitchen's refrigerators and shelves were empty when he walked in, he said.\n\n\"There was no food,\" Sims said. An inmate told his chief deputy, Doug Gibbs, that there had been 40 pounds of rice in the pantry the weekend before Sims became sheriff, but an employee of the outgoing sheriff had instructed the inmate to pour it down a garbage disposal. Gibbs confirmed the interaction in an interview.\n\nJames Hutcheson, chairman of the Marshall County Commission, said that Roto-Rooter had to be hired to clean out the disposal, which Sims said was still clogged with soggy rice when he took office.\n\n\"I was there at midnight that night Sheriff Sims took office, and I was aware of the rice being poured down the drain and everything,\" Hutcheson said. \"I was concerned about the situation.\"\n\nBut Sims had planned for the worst and arranged ahead of time for a food distributor to make a delivery in the early morning of Jan. 14, just in time to prepare breakfast and serve it to the inmates.\n\n\"That's the kind of childish crap we deal with,\" he said, referencing the dumping of the rice down the drain. \"It was food that was bought and reimbursed by the state that was bought for the purpose of feeding the inmates.\"\n\nTwenty new sheriffs took office in Alabama on Jan. 14. Half of them replaced sheriffs who retired or otherwise left their positions without running for reelection, handling the transition in a manner the new sheriffs generally described in public statements as fair and congenial. The other 10 sheriffs beat incumbents - eight of whom had held the position for at least 12 years - in last year's primary, runoff or general elections.\n\nThe handover appears to have gone smoothly for only one of the 10 newly elected sheriffs. Capt. David Agee, of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, said the transfer of power from former Sheriff Mike Hale to Pettway proceeded without incident. Pettway is the first black sheriff in the history of Jefferson County, the most populous county in Alabama and home to Birmingham, the largest city in the state.\n\n\"We don't have any issues to report,\" Agee said. \"The men and women of the sheriff's office are professionals and they're adjusting well and we're moving forward with everything we need to do.\"\n\nBobby Timmons has served as executive director of the Alabama Sheriffs Association since 1975. The bolo tie-wearing octogenarian, who previously served as a state legislator and sheriff of Jefferson County, has been such a powerful advocate for sheriffs over the course of his career that the association named its headquarters in downtown Montgomery after him.\n\nTimmons said outgoing sheriffs with grudges have long blown through funds, refused to communicate with incoming sheriffs and have even been known to pull trucks up to the backs of their county jails and fill them with any remaining food, leaving their replacements scrambling to feed inmates.\n\nIn most of the counties that saw sheriffs voted out of office last year, their replacements said they believed the former sheriffs took detrimental steps that were motivated by pettiness or anger.\n\nFor over six weeks, Terry Mears, the sheriff of Crenshaw County, did not have a badge. Though his new deputies had shiny golden stars awaiting them when Mears assumed office on Jan. 14, the rural county's new sheriff says he had to order one for himself that he didn't receive until Feb. 27.\n\nThe previous sheriff, Mickey Powell, had badges made for every sheriff's office employee who required one except, Mears said, for him. Powell did not respond to repeated requests for comment made via email and telephone.\n\nTimmons said it's common for sheriffs to engage in small feuds with their successors.\n\n\"The one that gets defeated, he doesn't want to be defeated, he doesn't want to lose,\" he said. \"And it may have been a dirty campaign, so you've got a hate pattern then.\"\n\nAs they settle into their jobs, newly elected sheriffs say moves by their predecessors near the ends of their terms have made it more difficult for them to keep the public and their deputies safe, enforce laws and execute the essential duties of their offices.\n\nBarbour County Sheriff Tyrone Smith said the transition from former Sheriff Leroy Upshaw \"has really been a challenge\" for his office. Following his defeat in the June primary election, Upshaw stopped selling pistol permits and halted the jail's work-release program, two vital revenue streams in the cash-strapped county of about 25,000 people near Alabama's southeastern corner, Smith said.\n\nOver the 46 months ending April 30, 2016, Barbour County brought in an average of about $5,400 per month from pistol permit fees and hundreds of dollars per month from its work-release program, according to the state's most recent audit of the sheriff's office.\n\nSmith said those moves and several other decisions Upshaw made in his final months left the department temporarily unable to pay for better equipment.\n\nHis deputies' cars needed new radar detectors. Their body cameras were outdated and needed to be replaced, Smith said.\n\n\"There's some things that my deputies need right now that the funding is not available for right now.\"\n\nUpshaw did not respond to repeated requests for comment made via email, voicemails left at multiple numbers listed as his in public records and phone messages left with his current employer, the sheriff's office in neighboring Russell County.\n\nThough counties foot the bill for most sheriff's office salaries, building upgrades and other major and recurring expenses, discretionary funds are a lifeblood for sheriffs, who use them for everything from uniforms and ammunition to vehicles and office software. The money is generated by assessing fees for pistol permits, auctioning off confiscated items, selling items in jail commissaries and other efforts. It is then divided into separate accounts.\n\nThe Alabama Department of Examiners of Public Accounts periodically audits sheriff's finances, including discretionary accounts, and they are generally subject to review by county financial officers. Sections of the state code that govern individual counties bar most sheriffs from using the funds for anything other than legitimate sheriff's office needs. But only sheriffs have the authority to decide what their offices purchase with the funds, and they largely spend them as they please.\n\nSo it's a major blow to new sheriffs when they find that their discretionary funds have been depleted.\n\nTurman, the new Covington County sheriff, said he could have used the discretionary funds the former sheriff, Meeks, spent on his way out of office to better equip his deputies, who each carry one of a variety of mismatched pistols, many of which require different types of ammunition.\n\n\"When it comes down to a firefight, if you run out of ammo and you look at your buddy and say, 'Hey, throw me a magazine,' but you can't throw them a magazine because your ammo is a different caliber, that's a problem,\" Turman said during a March interview in his modest office in rural Andalusia.\n\nInternal financial records provided to AL.com and ProPublica show that in September, two months after he lost his reelection bid, Meeks used more than $6,200 of sheriff's office funds to purchase coloring books, Frisbees, pencils and other promotional items emblazoned with his name.\n\nMeeks confirmed that he purchased the promotional items with office funds and left them behind in the sheriff's office. He said he bought a similar cache of items to distribute at the county fair every year he was sheriff.\n\n\"It was not bought just to be spending money,\" he said. \"It was bought for the county fair, but I had something come up so I couldn't make it this year.\"\n\nTurman also said he's been unable to locate about $40,000 from the state to pay for feeding inmates in December 2018 and January 2019. He provided an internal sheriff's office record suggesting a $39,900 shortfall in the jail food fund that he said corroborates his claim.\n\n\"I have no idea where it went,\" Turman said. \"It did not come here though.\"\n\nIn a phone interview, Meeks called his successor a liar, adding that, \"every bit of that money is in that account.\"\n\n\"I could've spent every bit of [the discretionary money] if I wanted to, because I was the sheriff, but I didn't,\" Meeks said. \"Until Jan. 14, I was still sheriff and I still had to operate the sheriff's office and had to spend money. I couldn't wait for his little butt to get there.\"\n\nBack in Marshall County, in north Alabama, Sims says he could have used the tens of thousands of dollars of sheriff's office funds Walls spent on what Sims called unnecessary items in the final months of his term. Sims said he would have replaced bulletproof vests and purchased new Tasers. He says he would have also bought new handguns to replace the aging ones many of his deputies were carrying when he took office, some of which were 20-plus years old.\n\nSims says that since Jan. 14, the Marshall County Commission has spent more than $900,000 on equipment, training, building repairs and other sheriff's office expenses that he says were neglected while Walls was sheriff. In March, the county announced it was accepting bids to complete upgrades to the county's jail that were requested by Sims and are expected to cost taxpayers around half a million dollars.\n\nHutcheson said he was \"disappointed\" to learn of the poor state of the sheriff's office's equipment, training and facilities under Walls.\n\n\"I believe in law enforcement having the equipment they need, and it should be kept in good working condition because they go out and put their lives on the line every day for the citizens and they should have good, updated equipment,\" Hutcheson said. \"We're working day and night trying to update the sheriff's [office] as quickly as possible.\"\n\nNick Smith, the new sheriff of Walker County who, at 35, is the youngest sheriff currently serving in Alabama, cut his teeth as a small-town police chief. Smith looks the part of sheriff with his crisp, bright-white uniforms and close-cropped hair. He takes pride in his ability to run a tight ship and limit costs, but he says he believes many sheriffs, including his predecessor Jim Underwood, fail to live up to that mission, in part because they act as if discretionary funds are \"their money\" to spend.\n\nInternal Walker County Sheriff's Office financial records reveal that discretionary fund spending skyrocketed after Underwood lost his reelection bid in July. Underwood spent approximately $162,000 worth of the funds in just three months, from August through October 2018. That's $9,000 more than was spent in the 10 previous months.\n\nUnderwood's last-minute purchases with discretionary money included more than $9,000 worth of black rubber gloves purchased at $69.99 per box about a week before he left office and $13,050 to buy a new washing machine and have it delivered to the jail.\n\nSmith said that he was able to quickly find the same model of gloves retailing online for $10 a box, and that he found a similar washing machine for sale online for over $10,000 less than the outgoing sheriff spent.\n\nThe records show that Underwood also used discretionary funds to purchase four brand-new sheriff's office vehicles, including a $32,671 Toyota Camry.\n\nUnderwood said in an interview at his home in a quiet community on the outskirts of Jasper that he did not personally order the gloves, that a county employee made the decision about which washing machine to buy and that he would have bought the cars even if he had won the election.\n\n\"I don't know about the gloves. I didn't order the gloves. It sounds like an excessive amount for whoever ordered them,\" he said. \"It's like anything else you purchase. You can always find cheaper somewhere, but it's to your own detriment to buy cheaper.\"\n\nUnderwood said that he left Smith \"somewhere around $150,000\" in the sheriff's office's discretionary accounts, which is in line with what the records show.\n\n\"Whatever money was spent out of that discretionary money was lawful,\" Underwood said. \"There's no way I would jeopardize a 45-year career in law enforcement for some monetary amount.\"\n\nSmith says the thousands of sheriff's office dollars Underwood spent on such big-ticket purchases should have instead been left behind for him to use.\n\n\"I would rather have the money,\" Smith said in an interview. \"When someone is going out of office, I would rather, not just here but statewide, [they] just leave that money and let the next incoming sheriff spend that for what he sees fit for his administration.\"\n\nAaron Littman, staff attorney at the Southern Center for Human Rights, an Atlanta-based nonprofit civil rights law firm that advocates for criminal justice reform in Alabama and has sued sheriffs across the state for financial records, said in a statement that sheriffs \"are not feudal kings\" and need to be held accountable.\n\n\"These allegations, along with a long track record of sheriffs misappropriating jail food funds, make clear that increased transparency and aggressive oversight is necessary,\" he said.\n\nToday, five months after he became Marshall County's top law enforcement officer, Sims is still trying to sort out the finances of the office he won.\n\nBetween December 2017 and August 2018, more than $81,000 worth of wire transfers were made from the Marshall County Sheriff's Office's general fund into one of Walls' personal bank accounts, according to internal sheriff's office records and interviews with two sheriff's office employees who reviewed the documents.\n\nThe records show that no other wire transfers were made from the fund over the nine-month period, and the two sheriff's office employees said they did not know why the disbursements - more than $29,000 of which took place after Walls lost his reelection bid - were made.\n\nThis is not the first time questions have been raised about how Walls managed sheriff's office funds. In August 2015, the state Department of Examiners of Public Accounts released an audit report stating that between January 2012 and February 2014 the sheriff's office used over $12,000 of public funds on \"payments made without legal authority\" and expenditures that \"were not for a law enforcement purpose.\" The report stated that the office spent $750 to pay \"property taxes of an individual\" and thousands more on unauthorized uniform allowances, travel expenses, and food, coffee and flower purchases. Walls repaid most of the money, but he declined to pay back over $1,000, prompting the agency to \"certify it to the district attorney for collection,\" according to the report.\n\nThat same month, the Alabama Ethics Commission alleged that Walls had violated ethics law, though it did not disclose details of the allegations, and referred the results of its investigation into his conduct to the state attorney general's office. Charges were never filed, and a special prosecutor's investigation into the alleged violation was dropped in August 2016. Walls denied any wrongdoing in a statement he provided at the time to media outlets, including the Sand Mountain Reporter newspaper.\n\nSims also complained about a series of large purchases the sheriff's office made over the final months of Walls' term, including an outlay of more than $20,000 for 24,000 rolls of toilet paper and $9,000 for 450 cases of trash bags. The sheriff's office also purchased 10 55-gallon drums of dishwashing liquid, but Sims has not been able to determine how much they cost. To put that spending in context, the sheriff's office has just $15,000 budgeted for janitorial supplies this year.\n\nIn October, The Advertiser-Gleam reported that Walls defended the five-figure toilet paper purchase. Sims says he was ultimately able to return around $5,000 worth of the rolls.\n\n\"We have always bought supplies for the jail in bulk for the year when we bought and kept it in the warehouse,\" Walls said, according to the Guntersville newspaper. \"But if [county officials] don't want us to do that, we will buy just enough to get by.\"\n\nGibbs, Sims' chief deputy, says he believes all the spending amounts to nothing more than a cynical ploy to undermine the new sheriff.\n\n\"They bought a bunch of unnecessary items just to spend the money, to keep us from having it.\"\n\nProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

      "text": "Wasted Funds, Destroyed Property: How Sheriffs Undermined Their Successors After Losing Reelection\n\nSheriff at the courthouse in a town road in South Carolina Pgiam/Getty\n\nThis story was originally published by ProPublica, which produced the article in partnership with AL.com , a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network .\n\nShortly after Phil Sims became the sheriff of Marshall County, Alabama, at 12 a.m. on Jan. 14, he found a cardboard box in a storage closet containing five government-issued smartphones, each with multiple holes drilled clear through them.\n\nIt was the first time Sims had been allowed to enter the sheriff's office, a red-brick building overlooking Lake Guntersville, a foggy bass-fishing mecca, since he defeated longtime Sheriff J. Scott Walls in the June primary election.\n\nIt didn't take long for Sims to learn that the destroyed iPhones and Androids had belonged to his predecessor and his top brass. Sims also discovered that the hard drives had been removed from the computers in his and his chief deputy's offices, and reams of records were nowhere to be found.\n\nThe records Walls did leave behind revealed that in the months following his electoral loss, he was wired tens of thousands of dollars from the sheriff's office's general fund, and more than $30,000 was missing from its commissary fund. The records, which were reviewed by AL.com and ProPublica , show that the sheriff's office spent tens of thousands of public dollars on expenditures that Sims described as unnecessary and excessive, including over 20,000 rolls of toilet paper, hundreds of boxes of garbage bags and 10 massive drums of dishwashing liquid.\n\nDonald Rhea, a lawyer for Walls, didn't respond to repeated emailed requests for comment on a detailed list of claims made by Sims. Walls' wife declined to connect a reporter with her husband and hung up the phone, and Walls did not respond to text and voice messages left at multiple numbers listed as his in public records.\n\nSims is not the only new sheriff who accused his predecessor of taking advantage of the power of his office as his term wound down. In fact, his predicament is just one example of a dubious but little-known tradition of Alabama sheriffs hobbling those who defeat them at the polls.\n\nAL.com and ProPublica interviewed nine of the 10 new sheriffs who won elections against incumbents last year. All nine said that last-minute actions by their predecessors had negative impacts on their offices and, by extension, the public. A captain in the office of the tenth, Jefferson County Sheriff Mark Pettway, said there were no problems during his transition.\n\nMany of the sheriffs alleged that their predecessors acted in ways that could be described as vindictive hazing: One failed to have a badge made for the new sheriff; another threw all the sheriff's office's unmarked keys in a pile, leaving his replacement to figure out which went to which door or vehicle.\n\nBut seven of the sheriffs made more serious accusations against their predecessors, many of which were corroborated by internal office records. Among their claims: Outgoing sheriffs pocketed public money, fudged financial reports, wasted sheriff's office funds and destroyed or stole public property.\n\nThe findings are part of a yearlong examination by AL.com and ProPublica into how Alabama sheriffs are overseen and the vast county-by-county disparities in how they execute their duties and enforce the law.\n\nAll the former sheriffs who responded to a reporter's inquiries denied wrongdoing, often insulting their successor or providing a counter-narrative aimed at disproving the claims.\n\nIn Alabama, sheriffs are the law beyond city limits, ruling over small towns, unincorporated farmlands and suburbs. Unlike police chiefs appointed by mayors and beholden to city councils, sheriffs answer to no one but the voters who elect them. State legislators and other county officials are typically unwilling to cross them.\n\nEvery day, the state's 67 sheriffs make decisions about what laws to enforce, what their deputies should focus on and who they should arrest. They run county jails, partner with the federal government and other agencies, and campaign to stay in office. Many of them oversee multimillion-dollar budgets, and every sheriff is largely responsible for deciding what county law enforcement activities taxpayers should pay for.\n\nLisa Graybill, deputy legal director for the Montgomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center, called for authorities to \"fully investigate whether any laws were broken\" by outgoing sheriffs after they were defeated in last year's elections. The SPLC has long studied sheriff's offices and other law enforcement agencies across the U.S., and it has sued sheriffs in several states, including Alabama, in recent years over alleged misconduct and abuse of power.\n\n\"At the very least, the conduct described and evidenced is a severe violation of the public's trust and at worst, may violate the law,\" Graybill said.\n\nAt least three sheriffs found ways to take home public money on their way out the door.\n\nLast year, AL.com reported that Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin pocketed more than $750,000 worth of funds initially allocated to purchase food for jail inmates between 2015 and 2017, and purchased a $740,000 beach house.\n\nSheriff's office financial documents recently obtained by ProPublica and AL.com via public record request show that in the six months after his June electoral loss, Entrekin personally received an additional $269,184 worth of checks from sheriff's office accounts. The records show that the money was initially allocated to feed federal immigration detainees and state and municipal inmates housed in the county jail.\n\nEntrekin did not respond to requests for comment via phone and text message, and Rhea, who is also his attorney, did not respond to emailed questions. Rhea instead provided a short statement denying new Sheriff Jonathon Horton's assertion that Entrekin refused to speak with him after the election.\n\nLast year, Entrekin said publicly that he had a legal right to leftover jail food funds under a Depression-era law. The state Legislature has since passed a law prohibiting sheriffs from keeping funds allocated to feed state inmates that they didn't use for that purpose.\n\nBut lawyers and law professors have said that Entrekin likely ran afoul of federal law by also keeping federal jail food money, as AL.com reported in December. In July, Entrekin told AL.com that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General was investigating his handling of inmate-feeding funds. No charges have been filed, and Rhea, Entrekin's lawyer, denied any misconduct at the time.\n\n\"He stands ready to cooperate fully and completely in the investigation that, hopefully, will begin immediately,\" Rhea, said in a July statement. \"That is what innocent people do.\"\n\nSix sheriffs say that they have requested state audits of their offices' finances and that they will decide how to proceed once they have the results in hand. The other three say they are handling the fallout themselves and want to avoid causing more bad blood.\n\n\"As far as criminal or unethical, we will see,\" Sims said. \"I've asked for an audit from the [Alabama Department of Examiners of Public Accounts] to address any issues.\"\n\nSheriff Blake Turman of Covington County said that he filed a complaint last month with the state Ethics Commission, which has not been previously reported, and that he also plans to submit a report to local prosecutors. Both are related to former Sheriff Dennis Meeks' spending during the transition period and what Turman alleges to be missing public funds and property. Meeks denies wrongdoing.\n\nThough other public officials in Alabama often face growing pains and hostile staffs after displacing incumbents, sheriffs are especially vulnerable to the whims of their predecessors. Sheriffs wield far greater power than most other elected officials to spend public funds as they see fit, and they are subject to far less oversight.\n\nIn Marshall County, Sims' first priority when he became sheriff wasn't finances. It was feeding the hundreds of people in the jail one floor below his office. The jailhouse kitchen's refrigerators and shelves were empty when he walked in, he said.\n\n\"There was no food,\" Sims said. An inmate told his chief deputy, Doug Gibbs, that there had been 40 pounds of rice in the pantry the weekend before Sims became sheriff, but an employee of the outgoing sheriff had instructed the inmate to pour it down a garbage disposal. Gibbs confirmed the interaction in an interview.\n\nJames Hutcheson, chairman of the Marshall County Commission, said that Roto-Rooter had to be hired to clean out the disposal, which Sims said was still clogged with soggy rice when he took office.\n\n\"I was there at midnight that night Sheriff Sims took office, and I was aware of the rice being poured down the drain and everything,\" Hutcheson said. \"I was concerned about the situation.\"\n\nBut Sims had planned for the worst and arranged ahead of time for a food distributor to make a delivery in the early morning of Jan. 14, just in time to prepare breakfast and serve it to the inmates.\n\n\"That's the kind of childish crap we deal with,\" he said, referencing the dumping of the rice down the drain. \"It was food that was bought and reimbursed by the state that was bought for the purpose of feeding the inmates.\"\n\nTwenty new sheriffs took office in Alabama on Jan. 14. Half of them replaced sheriffs who retired or otherwise left their positions without running for reelection, handling the transition in a manner the new sheriffs generally described in public statements as fair and congenial. The other 10 sheriffs beat incumbents - eight of whom had held the position for at least 12 years - in last year's primary, runoff or general elections.\n\nThe handover appears to have gone smoothly for only one of the 10 newly elected sheriffs. Capt. David Agee, of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, said the transfer of power from former Sheriff Mike Hale to Pettway proceeded without incident. Pettway is the first black sheriff in the history of Jefferson County, the most populous county in Alabama and home to Birmingham, the largest city in the state.\n\n\"We don't have any issues to report,\" Agee said. \"The men and women of the sheriff's office are professionals and they're adjusting well and we're moving forward with everything we need to do.\"\n\nBobby Timmons has served as executive director of the Alabama Sheriffs Association since 1975. The bolo tie-wearing octogenarian, who previously served as a state legislator and sheriff of Jefferson County, has been such a powerful advocate for sheriffs over the course of his career that the association named its headquarters in downtown Montgomery after him.\n\nTimmons said outgoing sheriffs with grudges have long blown through funds, refused to communicate with incoming sheriffs and have even been known to pull trucks up to the backs of their county jails and fill them with any remaining food, leaving their replacements scrambling to feed inmates.\n\nIn most of the counties that saw sheriffs voted out of office last year, their replacements said they believed the former sheriffs took detrimental steps that were motivated by pettiness or anger.\n\nFor over six weeks, Terry Mears, the sheriff of Crenshaw County, did not have a badge. Though his new deputies had shiny golden stars awaiting them when Mears assumed office on Jan. 14, the rural county's new sheriff says he had to order one for himself that he didn't receive until Feb. 27.\n\nThe previous sheriff, Mickey Powell, had badges made for every sheriff's office employee who required one except, Mears said, for him. Powell did not respond to repeated requests for comment made via email and telephone.\n\nTimmons said it's common for sheriffs to engage in small feuds with their successors.\n\n\"The one that gets defeated, he doesn't want to be defeated, he doesn't want to lose,\" he said. \"And it may have been a dirty campaign, so you've got a hate pattern then.\"\n\nAs they settle into their jobs, newly elected sheriffs say moves by their predecessors near the ends of their terms have made it more difficult for them to keep the public and their deputies safe, enforce laws and execute the essential duties of their offices.\n\nBarbour County Sheriff Tyrone Smith said the transition from former Sheriff Leroy Upshaw \"has really been a challenge\" for his office. Following his defeat in the June primary election, Upshaw stopped selling pistol permits and halted the jail's work-release program, two vital revenue streams in the cash-strapped county of about 25,000 people near Alabama's southeastern corner, Smith said.\n\nOver the 46 months ending April 30, 2016, Barbour County brought in an average of about $5,400 per month from pistol permit fees and hundreds of dollars per month from its work-release program, according to the state's most recent audit of the sheriff's office.\n\nSmith said those moves and several other decisions Upshaw made in his final months left the department temporarily unable to pay for better equipment.\n\nHis deputies' cars needed new radar detectors. Their body cameras were outdated and needed to be replaced, Smith said.\n\n\"There's some things that my deputies need right now that the funding is not available for right now.\"\n\nUpshaw did not respond to repeated requests for comment made via email, voicemails left at multiple numbers listed as his in public records and phone messages left with his current employer, the sheriff's office in neighboring Russell County.\n\nThough counties foot the bill for most sheriff's office salaries, building upgrades and other major and recurring expenses, discretionary funds are a lifeblood for sheriffs, who use them for everything from uniforms and ammunition to vehicles and office software. The money is generated by assessing fees for pistol permits, auctioning off confiscated items, selling items in jail commissaries and other efforts. It is then divided into separate accounts.\n\nThe Alabama Department of Examiners of Public Accounts periodically audits sheriff's finances, including discretionary accounts, and they are generally subject to review by county financial officers. Sections of the state code that govern individual counties bar most sheriffs from using the funds for anything other than legitimate sheriff's office needs. But only sheriffs have the authority to decide what their offices purchase with the funds, and they largely spend them as they please.\n\nSo it's a major blow to new sheriffs when they find that their discretionary funds have been depleted.\n\nTurman, the new Covington County sheriff, said he could have used the discretionary funds the former sheriff, Meeks, spent on his way out of office to better equip his deputies, who each carry one of a variety of mismatched pistols, many of which require different types of ammunition.\n\n\"When it comes down to a firefight, if you run out of ammo and you look at your buddy and say, 'Hey, throw me a magazine,' but you can't throw them a magazine because your ammo is a different caliber, that's a problem,\" Turman said during a March interview in his modest office in rural Andalusia.\n\nInternal financial records provided to AL.com and ProPublica show that in September, two months after he lost his reelection bid, Meeks used more than $6,200 of sheriff's office funds to purchase coloring books, Frisbees, pencils and other promotional items emblazoned with his name.\n\nMeeks confirmed that he purchased the promotional items with office funds and left them behind in the sheriff's office. He said he bought a similar cache of items to distribute at the county fair every year he was sheriff.\n\n\"It was not bought just to be spending money,\" he said. \"It was bought for the county fair, but I had something come up so I couldn't make it this year.\"\n\nTurman also said he's been unable to locate about $40,000 from the state to pay for feeding inmates in December 2018 and January 2019. He provided an internal sheriff's office record suggesting a $39,900 shortfall in the jail food fund that he said corroborates his claim.\n\n\"I have no idea where it went,\" Turman said. \"It did not come here though.\"\n\nIn a phone interview, Meeks called his successor a liar, adding that, \"every bit of that money is in that account.\"\n\n\"I could've spent every bit of [the discretionary money] if I wanted to, because I was the sheriff, but I didn't,\" Meeks said. \"Until Jan. 14, I was still sheriff and I still had to operate the sheriff's office and had to spend money. I couldn't wait for his little butt to get there.\"\n\nBack in Marshall County, in north Alabama, Sims says he could have used the tens of thousands of dollars of sheriff's office funds Walls spent on what Sims called unnecessary items in the final months of his term. Sims said he would have replaced bulletproof vests and purchased new Tasers. He says he would have also bought new handguns to replace the aging ones many of his deputies were carrying when he took office, some of which were 20-plus years old.\n\nSims says that since Jan. 14, the Marshall County Commission has spent more than $900,000 on equipment, training, building repairs and other sheriff's office expenses that he says were neglected while Walls was sheriff. In March, the county announced it was accepting bids to complete upgrades to the county's jail that were requested by Sims and are expected to cost taxpayers around half a million dollars.\n\nHutcheson said he was \"disappointed\" to learn of the poor state of the sheriff's office's equipment, training and facilities under Walls.\n\n\"I believe in law enforcement having the equipment they need, and it should be kept in good working condition because they go out and put their lives on the line every day for the citizens and they should have good, updated equipment,\" Hutcheson said. \"We're working day and night trying to update the sheriff's [office] as quickly as possible.\"\n\nNick Smith, the new sheriff of Walker County who, at 35, is the youngest sheriff currently serving in Alabama, cut his teeth as a small-town police chief. Smith looks the part of sheriff with his crisp, bright-white uniforms and close-cropped hair. He takes pride in his ability to run a tight ship and limit costs, but he says he believes many sheriffs, including his predecessor Jim Underwood, fail to live up to that mission, in part because they act as if discretionary funds are \"their money\" to spend.\n\nInternal Walker County Sheriff's Office financial records reveal that discretionary fund spending skyrocketed after Underwood lost his reelection bid in July. Underwood spent approximately $162,000 worth of the funds in just three months, from August through October 2018. That's $9,000 more than was spent in the 10 previous months.\n\nUnderwood's last-minute purchases with discretionary money included more than $9,000 worth of black rubber gloves purchased at $69.99 per box about a week before he left office and $13,050 to buy a new washing machine and have it delivered to the jail.\n\nSmith said that he was able to quickly find the same model of gloves retailing online for $10 a box, and that he found a similar washing machine for sale online for over $10,000 less than the outgoing sheriff spent.\n\nThe records show that Underwood also used discretionary funds to purchase four brand-new sheriff's office vehicles, including a $32,671 Toyota Camry.\n\nUnderwood said in an interview at his home in a quiet community on the outskirts of Jasper that he did not personally order the gloves, that a county employee made the decision about which washing machine to buy and that he would have bought the cars even if he had won the election.\n\n\"I don't know about the gloves. I didn't order the gloves. It sounds like an excessive amount for whoever ordered them,\" he said. \"It's like anything else you purchase. You can always find cheaper somewhere, but it's to your own detriment to buy cheaper.\"\n\nUnderwood said that he left Smith \"somewhere around $150,000\" in the sheriff's office's discretionary accounts, which is in line with what the records show.\n\n\"Whatever money was spent out of that discretionary money was lawful,\" Underwood said. \"There's no way I would jeopardize a 45-year career in law enforcement for some monetary amount.\"\n\nSmith says the thousands of sheriff's office dollars Underwood spent on such big-ticket purchases should have instead been left behind for him to use.\n\n\"I would rather have the money,\" Smith said in an interview. \"When someone is going out of office, I would rather, not just here but statewide, [they] just leave that money and let the next incoming sheriff spend that for what he sees fit for his administration.\"\n\nAaron Littman, staff attorney at the Southern Center for Human Rights, an Atlanta-based nonprofit civil rights law firm that advocates for criminal justice reform in Alabama and has sued sheriffs across the state for financial records, said in a statement that sheriffs \"are not feudal kings\" and need to be held accountable.\n\n\"These allegations, along with a long track record of sheriffs misappropriating jail food funds, make clear that increased transparency and aggressive oversight is necessary,\" he said.\n\nToday, five months after he became Marshall County's top law enforcement officer, Sims is still trying to sort out the finances of the office he won.\n\nBetween December 2017 and August 2018, more than $81,000 worth of wire transfers were made from the Marshall County Sheriff's Office's general fund into one of Walls' personal bank accounts, according to internal sheriff's office records and interviews with two sheriff's office employees who reviewed the documents.\n\nThe records show that no other wire transfers were made from the fund over the nine-month period, and the two sheriff's office employees said they did not know why the disbursements - more than $29,000 of which took place after Walls lost his reelection bid - were made.\n\nThis is not the first time questions have been raised about how Walls managed sheriff's office funds. In August 2015, the state Department of Examiners of Public Accounts released an audit report stating that between January 2012 and February 2014 the sheriff's office used over $12,000 of public funds on \"payments made without legal authority\" and expenditures that \"were not for a law enforcement purpose.\" The report stated that the office spent $750 to pay \"property taxes of an individual\" and thousands more on unauthorized uniform allowances, travel expenses, and food, coffee and flower purchases. Walls repaid most of the money, but he declined to pay back over $1,000, prompting the agency to \"certify it to the district attorney for collection,\" according to the report.\n\nThat same month, the Alabama Ethics Commission alleged that Walls had violated ethics law, though it did not disclose details of the allegations, and referred the results of its investigation into his conduct to the state attorney general's office. Charges were never filed, and a special prosecutor's investigation into the alleged violation was dropped in August 2016. Walls denied any wrongdoing in a statement he provided at the time to media outlets, including the Sand Mountain Reporter newspaper.\n\nSims also complained about a series of large purchases the sheriff's office made over the final months of Walls' term, including an outlay of more than $20,000 for 24,000 rolls of toilet paper and $9,000 for 450 cases of trash bags. The sheriff's office also purchased 10 55-gallon drums of dishwashing liquid, but Sims has not been able to determine how much they cost. To put that spending in context, the sheriff's office has just $15,000 budgeted for janitorial supplies this year.\n\nIn October, The Advertiser-Gleam reported that Walls defended the five-figure toilet paper purchase. Sims says he was ultimately able to return around $5,000 worth of the rolls.\n\n\"We have always bought supplies for the jail in bulk for the year when we bought and kept it in the warehouse,\" Walls said, according to the Guntersville newspaper. \"But if [county officials] don't want us to do that, we will buy just enough to get by.\"\n\nGibbs, Sims' chief deputy, says he believes all the spending amounts to nothing more than a cynical ploy to undermine the new sheriff.\n\n\"They bought a bunch of unnecessary items just to spend the money, to keep us from having it.\"\n\nProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

      "text": "How Some Sheriffs Force Their Inmates Into Medical Debt\n\nIn Alabama, jail inmates' health care costs could depend on the county they're arrested in. Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n\nThis story was published in partnership with ProPublica , a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica 's Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.\n\nIn Alabama, the county in which you're arrested could be the deciding factor in who will be financially responsible for your medical bills behind bars.\n\nIn Baldwin County, known for its white-sand Gulf Coast beaches and waterfront communities, the sheriff's office ensures that inmates in the county jail do not have to pay anything more than a $15 copayment for medical care.\n\n\"Inmates are not billed for the full cost of any medical care either inside or outside\" the jail, Sheriff Hoss Mack said in an email. \"Alabama Code Title 14 assigns financial responsibility of inmates' medical treatment to the department where they are being held.\"\n\nJust across the bay in Mobile County, home to one of the busiest ports in the U.S. and the eponymous city of nearly 200,000 people built around it, Sheriff Sam Cochran takes a different tack: Some of his inmates are personally on the hook for the full cost of medically necessary care they receive from outside doctors while incarcerated, even if they are awaiting trial.\n\nThe difference between the two sheriffs' approaches demonstrates the unique power Alabama sheriffs have to set their own rules and answer only to voters. Legal experts and civil rights advocates say sheriffs like Cochran are likely violating both state law and the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines.\n\nIt's not just happening in Mobile County. In multiple instances confirmed by AL.com and ProPublica , inmates have had medical bills sent to collections while they were still behind bars, damaging their credit and putting pressure on their family members to pay up to ensure the care continued.\n\nBrandon DeLaFosse is among them. He was arrested on domestic violence, burglary and robbery charges and booked into the Mobile County Metro Jail in November 2018, three months after he underwent surgery on his inner ear. Since then, he has received bills totaling thousands of dollars for necessary follow-up appointments and tests, some of which have gone to collections while he remains behind bars.\n\n\"He keeps getting bills in the mail,\" said Alicia DeLaFosse, Brandon's mother, who has paid hundreds of dollars for care he has received while in custody. \"It's all money he owes from going back and forth to the doctor.\"\n\nLike many inmates, DeLaFosse doesn't have significant income or access to public or private insurance in jail.\n\nAlabama law is clear: If an \"inmate develops a medical condition which requires immediate treatment at a medical-care facility outside the county jail, the department shall be financially responsible for the cost of the treatment of the inmate.\"\n\nBut Cochran said when the jail's doctors determine inmates need care that goes beyond what in-house medical staff and contracted outpatient providers can handle, they are often taken to private medical professionals who do not have contracts with the jail. And he allows those medical providers to bill at least some of those inmates directly.\n\n\"When that person is taken out to that private medical facility or something like that, then, yeah, they're going to bill him for that treatment,\" Cochran said during an interview in his office last month. \"It's a more than reasonable thing to do.\"\n\nAsked later about the details of Brandon DeLaFosse's case and how the practice squares with state and federal law, Cochran provided an email written by Trey Oliver, warden of the Mobile County Metro Jail.\n\nOliver wrote that inmates are required to pay \"when they have a follow-up procedure or visit from a surgery conducted prior to being booked.\"\n\nAs for DeLaFosse, Oliver wrote, \"There was a follow up visit or two and his mother agreed to pay it beforehand.\"\n\nMost jails and prisons across Alabama and the U.S. either have doctors and nurses on staff or contract with outside companies to provide medical care in their lockups. It's not uncommon for inmates to be charged low copays-typically less than $20-for medications and medical services.\n\nBut requiring inmates to foot the bill for their health care takes that practice to another level.\n\nThat's \"like charging them for their own food,\" said John Lentine, a Birmingham criminal defense attorney and adjunct law professor at Samford University's Cumberland School of Law and the Birmingham School of Law. \"To me it's a basic human rights kind of thing.\"\n\nMichele Deitch, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin's School of Law and Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, said the practice is \"absolutely\" unconstitutional.\n\n\"There is a constitutional obligation to provide health care that meets the serious medical needs of people who are incarcerated,\" said Deitch, who co-wrote the American Bar Association's Standards on Treatment of Prisoners . \"That's not negotiable.\"\n\nThe tactic is another way in which sheriffs across Alabama are avoiding financial responsibility for inmate medical care. AL.com and ProPublica reported in September that many sheriffs in Alabama and across the country are finding ways to release inmates from jail just before they incur expensive hospital bills, a tactic known as \"medical bond.\"\n\nIn several recent cases, incarcerated people around the country have successfully challenged policies restricting their access to free medical care in prison.\n\nLast year, a federal court ruled that transgender inmates in Missouri's state prisons have a right to receive hormone therapy free of charge while incarcerated, regardless of whether they were already receiving the treatments when they were taken into custody. And this year, prisoners in Minnesota reached a settlement with the state's Department of Corrections that requires the prison system to provide prisoners who have Hepatitis C with expensive drugs that often cure the infection.\n\nAL.com and ProPublica attempted to contact the sheriffs of all 67 counties in Alabama via email or phone to ask whether they allow inmates to be billed for care they receive while incarcerated. Of those, 13 sheriffs and one chief deputy responded. The sheriff of Mobile County and chief deputy of Jackson County each said they allow providers to bill inmates for necessary care in certain situations. Ten sheriffs said they do not allow inmates to be billed. Two others declined to comment.\n\nDays after Thanksgiving last year, Brandon DeLaFosse was arrested in Mississippi on outstanding warrants stemming from an incident earlier that month in Mobile County, Alabama.\n\nThe then-28-year-old was driven back to Mobile, where he stayed in the county jail until Feb. 28, when he was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nDeLaFosse's health problems continued behind bars. Since his ear surgery last year, he has suffered from persistent ear infections and severe hearing loss.\n\nAnd his bills are piling up.\n\nIn between Marlboro Lights and peanut butter-and-syrup sandwiches at her Irvington home last month, DeLaFosse's mother, Alicia, said she spends many hours each week making calls, sending emails and conducting research to advocate on behalf of her son.\n\nShe said a steady stream of medical bills addressed to her son has arrived at her house since his arrest. Billing records show that she has spent more than $600 on his care since his arrest, and more than $1,000 in outstanding bills have gone to debt collection.\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2018, while he was in the Mobile County Metro Jail, Brandon DeLaFosse was taken to see an ear, nose and throat specialist at Providence Hospital in Mobile for a surgery follow-up visit recommended by the doctor. But first, his mother said, jail staff required her to make a payment to the doctor's office. After the appointment, the hospital's billing department sent a bill for $729 for tests he underwent that day to Alicia DeLaFosse's house.\n\n\"The way the nurse at the jail explained it to me is because it was something that didn't happen at the jail, it's preexisting. ... I had to go pay for it myself,\" she said. \"For the jail to allow him to go see the doctor, I had to go to the doctor's office and pay $125 first.\"\n\nA registered nurse at the jail in Mobile noted in Brandon DeLaFosse's medical record that his mother made a payment and that the nurse had scheduled a follow-up visit for later that month. In January 2019, a nurse practitioner at the jail wrote a note in his file stating she would request another follow-up appointment with his doctor \"with the expectation that it is handled in the usual fashion with his mother arranging for payment.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's fair. They're responsible for my medical care, so why should it be coming out of my pockets or my family's pockets?\" Brandon DeLaFosse said in a jailhouse phone call.\n\nCochran, the Mobile County sheriff, said via email that he views the situation as a \"legal dispute between [Brandon DeLaFosse], us and our contracted provider. I know of no complaint or claim made against us.\"\n\n\"The mom agreed to pay [the] bill. Looks like she reneged,\" Cochran wrote. \"Otherwise if it would have been medically necessary our contracted folks would have handled.\"\n\nAlicia DeLaFosse said she \"didn't renege\" and paid for all of the medical costs she knew about in advance.\n\nBrandon DeLaFosse continued to be billed for outside medical care after he was moved to state prison. On July 23, nearly five months after his sentence began, he saw a doctor and underwent tests at Providence Hospital. He was sent a bill for $224.70 for outpatient diagnostics administered that day, plus $71.98 for the doctor visit.\n\nThat shouldn't have happened, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement.\n\n\"By ADOC'S policy, all inmates in the care, custody, and control of any ADOC correctional facility are not charged or responsible for community-based medical care or mental health services,\" the spokeswoman, Samantha Banks, said.\n\nAny state prisoners \"incorrectly\" billed for outpatient medical care should notify the provider that they were incarcerated at the time, the statement explained. \"The medical provider should submit to the Department the appropriate paperwork and any outstanding inmate medical bills will be directed to the appropriate payer.\"\n\nState prisoners in Arizona have reported similar issues with providers billing them directly for medical care they received while incarcerated, as KJZZ radio reported this year. Like in Alabama, the Arizona Department of Corrections has said the bills were sent out in error and that the department or its medical contractor would pay the inmates' bills.\n\nBut that's a vastly different situation than the one facing inmates in some Alabama counties, where sheriff's offices are not chalking up such bills to error and are in fact deliberately choosing to avoid paying medical bills for inmates in their charge.\n\nThough the public often has little sympathy for inmates, incarcerated people do have clear rights, particularly when it comes to health care behind bars.\n\nAlabama law states that \"necessary clothing and bedding must be furnished by the sheriff or jailer, at the expense of the county, to those prisoners who are unable to provide them for themselves, and also necessary medicines and medical attention to those who are sick or injured, when they are unable to provide them for themselves.\"\n\nIn another section of the state code, a definition of a county inmate includes an explicit reference to their health care being provided for: \"any person being held in a public institution under the administrative control and responsibility of the county sheriff and for whom the county is responsible for the provision of medical care.\"\n\nBrandon Blankenship, an assistant professor of law and ethics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that allowing inmates to be billed for care that they receive while incarcerated amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and that the bills are excessive fines.\n\n\"I don't think it's ever been challenged in court in Alabama, but from where I'm sitting, the answer to me is that, no, it's certainly not constitutional under the Eighth Amendment.\"\n\nThe tactics of some Alabama sheriffs stand in sharp contrast to what's going on elsewhere in the country. This year, California and Illinois banned the practice of charging inmates copays, and a number of other states have taken, or are considering, steps to rein in the practice.\n\n\"They usually cannot afford even a $5 copay, so the idea that they could pay thousands of dollars for these services is laughable from a practical perspective and it's downright evil on many different levels,\" said Deitch, the University of Texas at Austin professor.\n\nIn 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a seminal case, City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital , involving a person who was hurt during an arrest and taken to a hospital. The court ruled that \"as long as the governmental entity ensures that the medical care needed is in fact provided, the Constitution does not dictate how the cost of that care should be allocated as between the entity and the provider of the care. That is a matter of state law.\"\n\nBut that ruling did not answer the question of whether inmates can be stuck with the bill.\n\n\"We don't have any clear Supreme Court ruling,\" said Fred Cohen, a professor emeritus at the University at Albany's School of Criminal Justice who has decades of experience in corrections law and serves as executive editor of Correctional Law Reporter.\n\nCohen said he believes there is a good case to be made that the practice of allowing inmates to be billed for medical care violates their constitutional rights.\n\n\"I don't think it's an open policy question in that inmates should not be required to pay,\" he said. \"I think it could be held unconstitutional by the right court.\"\n\nSeveral days after Charles Tillman was booked into the Washington County Jail in March 2018, his left testicle became severely inflamed. He told a guard, and on March 22, Tillman was taken to Washington County Hospital for treatment and an ultrasound.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who has a long rap sheet, was driven back to the jail following the appointment and was released from the facility the following day. (The Washington County Sheriff's Office confirmed the dates of his incarceration. But the nature of his offense was not clear based on court records, and the sheriff's office would not discuss his charges during a phone call with Tillman and a reporter.)\n\nIt wasn't until weeks later that Tillman learned that he had been billed directly for that visit and that the debt had been sent to a collector, upending his credit. He showed AL.com and ProPublica a copy of his credit report showing it had been negatively affected by unpaid medical bills.\n\n\"They tried to get me to sign paperwork but I refused to sign it, the hospital bill saying I was responsible for it.\"\n\nAs of this month, Tillman still owed $1,856.42 for medical care he received at Washington County Hospital. The hospital confirmed that it treated him during each of his brief incarcerations in the jail in February 2017, March 2018 and September 2018.\n\n\"I got the bills at my [home] address,\" said Tillman, who has since been released. \"They're on my credit report now as negative marks-that's what's keeping me from getting a car right now.\"\n\nWashington County Sheriff Richard Stringer was unable to explain Tillman's situation, saying the county's policy is to pay for all medical costs for inmates who aren't covered by insurance.\n\n\"That's not standard procedure,\" Stringer said. \"It would have to be an unusual case for that to happen, and I don't keep up with every case that comes in. But no, that's not our policy.\"\n\nHundreds of miles northeast, Rocky Harnen, chief deputy of the Jackson County Sheriff's Office, said preexisting conditions should be inmates' responsibility.\n\n\"If it's something preexisting, say diabetes or something, and you've got to go to the doctor every now and then, then that's their responsibility to pay for that,\" he said.\n\n\"If it's going to your own doctor, they would be responsible for that. I guess they would bill them at their house. The taxpayers shouldn't be responsible for ongoing issues that are preexisting.\"\n\nHarnen referred subsequent questions about the legality of the practice to County Attorney John Porter, who did not cite any laws that allowed it.\n\n\"I can't say that there's not any medical care that they have to pay for,\" Porter said.\n\nAsked if inmates sometimes have to pay for outpatient care for preexisting conditions, he said, \"I wouldn't say that that's incorrect. ... I can't give you a blanket answer to that but it would be depending on the circumstances.\"\n\nThat's not the way inmate health care works in many county jails across Alabama. In Etowah County, northeast of Birmingham, inmates are never billed for care they receive while incarcerated, according to Sheriff Jonathon Horton.\n\n\"We provide medical services for inmates in our care so they should not receive any bills,\" Horton said. \"They shouldn't be billed. That's my understanding.\"\n\nLauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said that he would love to have inmates in his jail in northwest Alabama foot the bill for certain types of medical care, but that he is not legally able to do so. For instance, he said he would like to have avoided the $300,000 the county once had to pay for open heart surgery for \"the town drunk\" arrested on a public intoxication charge.\n\n\"If they're in jail on public intoxication and they've got preexisting health conditions, I don't think the taxpayer should have to foot the bill to pay for it,\" Singleton said. \"If they get injured inside the jail or they get sick inside the jail, we of course pay for it. But my issue is with having to pay for preexisting conditions. But we have to do it.\"\n\nProPublica and AL.com will be investigating the extraordinary power of Alabama sheriffs all year.

      "text": "How Some Sheriffs Force Their Inmates Into Medical Debt\n\nIn Alabama, jail inmates' health care costs could depend on the county they're arrested in. Rich Pedroncelli/AP\n\nThis story was published in partnership with ProPublica , a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica 's Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.\n\nIn Alabama, the county in which you're arrested could be the deciding factor in who will be financially responsible for your medical bills behind bars.\n\nIn Baldwin County, known for its white-sand Gulf Coast beaches and waterfront communities, the sheriff's office ensures that inmates in the county jail do not have to pay anything more than a $15 copayment for medical care.\n\n\"Inmates are not billed for the full cost of any medical care either inside or outside\" the jail, Sheriff Hoss Mack said in an email. \"Alabama Code Title 14 assigns financial responsibility of inmates' medical treatment to the department where they are being held.\"\n\nJust across the bay in Mobile County, home to one of the busiest ports in the U.S. and the eponymous city of nearly 200,000 people built around it, Sheriff Sam Cochran takes a different tack: Some of his inmates are personally on the hook for the full cost of medically necessary care they receive from outside doctors while incarcerated, even if they are awaiting trial.\n\nThe difference between the two sheriffs' approaches demonstrates the unique power Alabama sheriffs have to set their own rules and answer only to voters. Legal experts and civil rights advocates say sheriffs like Cochran are likely violating both state law and the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines.\n\nIt's not just happening in Mobile County. In multiple instances confirmed by AL.com and ProPublica , inmates have had medical bills sent to collections while they were still behind bars, damaging their credit and putting pressure on their family members to pay up to ensure the care continued.\n\nBrandon DeLaFosse is among them. He was arrested on domestic violence, burglary and robbery charges and booked into the Mobile County Metro Jail in November 2018, three months after he underwent surgery on his inner ear. Since then, he has received bills totaling thousands of dollars for necessary follow-up appointments and tests, some of which have gone to collections while he remains behind bars.\n\n\"He keeps getting bills in the mail,\" said Alicia DeLaFosse, Brandon's mother, who has paid hundreds of dollars for care he has received while in custody. \"It's all money he owes from going back and forth to the doctor.\"\n\nLike many inmates, DeLaFosse doesn't have significant income or access to public or private insurance in jail.\n\nAlabama law is clear: If an \"inmate develops a medical condition which requires immediate treatment at a medical-care facility outside the county jail, the department shall be financially responsible for the cost of the treatment of the inmate.\"\n\nBut Cochran said when the jail's doctors determine inmates need care that goes beyond what in-house medical staff and contracted outpatient providers can handle, they are often taken to private medical professionals who do not have contracts with the jail. And he allows those medical providers to bill at least some of those inmates directly.\n\n\"When that person is taken out to that private medical facility or something like that, then, yeah, they're going to bill him for that treatment,\" Cochran said during an interview in his office last month. \"It's a more than reasonable thing to do.\"\n\nAsked later about the details of Brandon DeLaFosse's case and how the practice squares with state and federal law, Cochran provided an email written by Trey Oliver, warden of the Mobile County Metro Jail.\n\nOliver wrote that inmates are required to pay \"when they have a follow-up procedure or visit from a surgery conducted prior to being booked.\"\n\nAs for DeLaFosse, Oliver wrote, \"There was a follow up visit or two and his mother agreed to pay it beforehand.\"\n\nMost jails and prisons across Alabama and the U.S. either have doctors and nurses on staff or contract with outside companies to provide medical care in their lockups. It's not uncommon for inmates to be charged low copays-typically less than $20-for medications and medical services.\n\nBut requiring inmates to foot the bill for their health care takes that practice to another level.\n\nThat's \"like charging them for their own food,\" said John Lentine, a Birmingham criminal defense attorney and adjunct law professor at Samford University's Cumberland School of Law and the Birmingham School of Law. \"To me it's a basic human rights kind of thing.\"\n\nMichele Deitch, a senior lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin's School of Law and Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, said the practice is \"absolutely\" unconstitutional.\n\n\"There is a constitutional obligation to provide health care that meets the serious medical needs of people who are incarcerated,\" said Deitch, who co-wrote the American Bar Association's Standards on Treatment of Prisoners . \"That's not negotiable.\"\n\nThe tactic is another way in which sheriffs across Alabama are avoiding financial responsibility for inmate medical care. AL.com and ProPublica reported in September that many sheriffs in Alabama and across the country are finding ways to release inmates from jail just before they incur expensive hospital bills, a tactic known as \"medical bond.\"\n\nIn several recent cases, incarcerated people around the country have successfully challenged policies restricting their access to free medical care in prison.\n\nLast year, a federal court ruled that transgender inmates in Missouri's state prisons have a right to receive hormone therapy free of charge while incarcerated, regardless of whether they were already receiving the treatments when they were taken into custody. And this year, prisoners in Minnesota reached a settlement with the state's Department of Corrections that requires the prison system to provide prisoners who have Hepatitis C with expensive drugs that often cure the infection.\n\nAL.com and ProPublica attempted to contact the sheriffs of all 67 counties in Alabama via email or phone to ask whether they allow inmates to be billed for care they receive while incarcerated. Of those, 13 sheriffs and one chief deputy responded. The sheriff of Mobile County and chief deputy of Jackson County each said they allow providers to bill inmates for necessary care in certain situations. Ten sheriffs said they do not allow inmates to be billed. Two others declined to comment.\n\nDays after Thanksgiving last year, Brandon DeLaFosse was arrested in Mississippi on outstanding warrants stemming from an incident earlier that month in Mobile County, Alabama.\n\nThe then-28-year-old was driven back to Mobile, where he stayed in the county jail until Feb. 28, when he was sentenced to three years in prison.\n\nDeLaFosse's health problems continued behind bars. Since his ear surgery last year, he has suffered from persistent ear infections and severe hearing loss.\n\nAnd his bills are piling up.\n\nIn between Marlboro Lights and peanut butter-and-syrup sandwiches at her Irvington home last month, DeLaFosse's mother, Alicia, said she spends many hours each week making calls, sending emails and conducting research to advocate on behalf of her son.\n\nShe said a steady stream of medical bills addressed to her son has arrived at her house since his arrest. Billing records show that she has spent more than $600 on his care since his arrest, and more than $1,000 in outstanding bills have gone to debt collection.\n\nOn Dec. 6, 2018, while he was in the Mobile County Metro Jail, Brandon DeLaFosse was taken to see an ear, nose and throat specialist at Providence Hospital in Mobile for a surgery follow-up visit recommended by the doctor. But first, his mother said, jail staff required her to make a payment to the doctor's office. After the appointment, the hospital's billing department sent a bill for $729 for tests he underwent that day to Alicia DeLaFosse's house.\n\n\"The way the nurse at the jail explained it to me is because it was something that didn't happen at the jail, it's preexisting. ... I had to go pay for it myself,\" she said. \"For the jail to allow him to go see the doctor, I had to go to the doctor's office and pay $125 first.\"\n\nA registered nurse at the jail in Mobile noted in Brandon DeLaFosse's medical record that his mother made a payment and that the nurse had scheduled a follow-up visit for later that month. In January 2019, a nurse practitioner at the jail wrote a note in his file stating she would request another follow-up appointment with his doctor \"with the expectation that it is handled in the usual fashion with his mother arranging for payment.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's fair. They're responsible for my medical care, so why should it be coming out of my pockets or my family's pockets?\" Brandon DeLaFosse said in a jailhouse phone call.\n\nCochran, the Mobile County sheriff, said via email that he views the situation as a \"legal dispute between [Brandon DeLaFosse], us and our contracted provider. I know of no complaint or claim made against us.\"\n\n\"The mom agreed to pay [the] bill. Looks like she reneged,\" Cochran wrote. \"Otherwise if it would have been medically necessary our contracted folks would have handled.\"\n\nAlicia DeLaFosse said she \"didn't renege\" and paid for all of the medical costs she knew about in advance.\n\nBrandon DeLaFosse continued to be billed for outside medical care after he was moved to state prison. On July 23, nearly five months after his sentence began, he saw a doctor and underwent tests at Providence Hospital. He was sent a bill for $224.70 for outpatient diagnostics administered that day, plus $71.98 for the doctor visit.\n\nThat shouldn't have happened, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement.\n\n\"By ADOC'S policy, all inmates in the care, custody, and control of any ADOC correctional facility are not charged or responsible for community-based medical care or mental health services,\" the spokeswoman, Samantha Banks, said.\n\nAny state prisoners \"incorrectly\" billed for outpatient medical care should notify the provider that they were incarcerated at the time, the statement explained. \"The medical provider should submit to the Department the appropriate paperwork and any outstanding inmate medical bills will be directed to the appropriate payer.\"\n\nState prisoners in Arizona have reported similar issues with providers billing them directly for medical care they received while incarcerated, as KJZZ radio reported this year. Like in Alabama, the Arizona Department of Corrections has said the bills were sent out in error and that the department or its medical contractor would pay the inmates' bills.\n\nBut that's a vastly different situation than the one facing inmates in some Alabama counties, where sheriff's offices are not chalking up such bills to error and are in fact deliberately choosing to avoid paying medical bills for inmates in their charge.\n\nThough the public often has little sympathy for inmates, incarcerated people do have clear rights, particularly when it comes to health care behind bars.\n\nAlabama law states that \"necessary clothing and bedding must be furnished by the sheriff or jailer, at the expense of the county, to those prisoners who are unable to provide them for themselves, and also necessary medicines and medical attention to those who are sick or injured, when they are unable to provide them for themselves.\"\n\nIn another section of the state code, a definition of a county inmate includes an explicit reference to their health care being provided for: \"any person being held in a public institution under the administrative control and responsibility of the county sheriff and for whom the county is responsible for the provision of medical care.\"\n\nBrandon Blankenship, an assistant professor of law and ethics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that allowing inmates to be billed for care that they receive while incarcerated amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and that the bills are excessive fines.\n\n\"I don't think it's ever been challenged in court in Alabama, but from where I'm sitting, the answer to me is that, no, it's certainly not constitutional under the Eighth Amendment.\"\n\nThe tactics of some Alabama sheriffs stand in sharp contrast to what's going on elsewhere in the country. This year, California and Illinois banned the practice of charging inmates copays, and a number of other states have taken, or are considering, steps to rein in the practice.\n\n\"They usually cannot afford even a $5 copay, so the idea that they could pay thousands of dollars for these services is laughable from a practical perspective and it's downright evil on many different levels,\" said Deitch, the University of Texas at Austin professor.\n\nIn 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a seminal case, City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital , involving a person who was hurt during an arrest and taken to a hospital. The court ruled that \"as long as the governmental entity ensures that the medical care needed is in fact provided, the Constitution does not dictate how the cost of that care should be allocated as between the entity and the provider of the care. That is a matter of state law.\"\n\nBut that ruling did not answer the question of whether inmates can be stuck with the bill.\n\n\"We don't have any clear Supreme Court ruling,\" said Fred Cohen, a professor emeritus at the University at Albany's School of Criminal Justice who has decades of experience in corrections law and serves as executive editor of Correctional Law Reporter.\n\nCohen said he believes there is a good case to be made that the practice of allowing inmates to be billed for medical care violates their constitutional rights.\n\n\"I don't think it's an open policy question in that inmates should not be required to pay,\" he said. \"I think it could be held unconstitutional by the right court.\"\n\nSeveral days after Charles Tillman was booked into the Washington County Jail in March 2018, his left testicle became severely inflamed. He told a guard, and on March 22, Tillman was taken to Washington County Hospital for treatment and an ultrasound.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who has a long rap sheet, was driven back to the jail following the appointment and was released from the facility the following day. (The Washington County Sheriff's Office confirmed the dates of his incarceration. But the nature of his offense was not clear based on court records, and the sheriff's office would not discuss his charges during a phone call with Tillman and a reporter.)\n\nIt wasn't until weeks later that Tillman learned that he had been billed directly for that visit and that the debt had been sent to a collector, upending his credit. He showed AL.com and ProPublica a copy of his credit report showing it had been negatively affected by unpaid medical bills.\n\n\"They tried to get me to sign paperwork but I refused to sign it, the hospital bill saying I was responsible for it.\"\n\nAs of this month, Tillman still owed $1,856.42 for medical care he received at Washington County Hospital.

      "text": "Want to Know How Your Local Jail Operates? Sorry, That May Be a Trade Secret.\n\nJoan Wong\n\nFour days before Christmas 2016, Heather Ashton Miller, an inmate in Davis County Jail outside Salt Lake City, slipped while climbing down from her bunk bed. The 28-year-old, who had been arrested a day earlier for alleged drug-related misdemeanors, fell five feet and landed with a thud. When she tried to stand, she couldn't-the fall had ruptured her spleen. As her lips turned purple , jail staffers gave her ibuprofen. It took nearly three hours for emergency medics to arrive; she died shortly after reaching the hospital.\n\nWhen lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah asked for the jail's operational standards, hoping to find out what had happened to Miller and other inmates who had died, they were told they couldn't see them: The guidelines had been written by a contractor named Gary DeLand, who insisted that sharing his copyrighted work would jeopardize his business of developing jail guidelines and would open sheriffs to lawsuits. In April 2018, the Utah State Records Committee agreed , ruling that Davis County Jail did not need to release its guidelines because the county did not own them.\n\nMany jails have guidelines to ensure they comply with constitutional requirements to keep inmates safe and healthy. These standards can govern virtually all aspects of a jail's operations, from its medical care and food safety to the dimensions of its cells and mailroom procedures. \"If the jail wrote and kept these standards itself, they would be public,\" says David Reymann, an attorney who is representing the ACLU of Utah and the Disability Law Center in a lawsuit seeking access to the Davis County Jail guidelines. The idea that \"you can contract out to a third party and put your governmental records into a black box is very troubling,\" says ACLU attorney Leah Farrell.\n\nDeLand sold his jail standards to the Utah Sheriffs' Association for $15,000 in the 1990s, not long after his seven-­year tenure as chief of the state corrections department. A self-described \"Idaho country boy who never spent a day in law school,\" he wrote his first jail manual around 1965 while working as a sheriff's deputy. He found he could earn much more as a private correctional expert than as a public servant. In 2003 , the Bush administration tapped DeLand to help renovate Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, where he established a corrections academy. He says he has conducted workshops for the FBI and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and spoken at correctional trainings in dozens of states.\n\nSince the 1970s, DeLand has written or helped develop jail standards in at least 19 states, striking agreements with counties and sheriffs' groups to keep his model guidelines private. When lawyers requested to see the DeLand-inspired standards for Oregon's Deschutes County Jail as part of a wrongful death lawsuit in 2015, the sheriffs' association there claimed they were a \"trade secret\" like \"the formula for Coca-Cola or the recipe for KFC.\" Making them public \"would destroy their value,\" the association's executive director said. A federal district court ruled that the documents must remain confidential. A representative of the local sheriffs' association in Wyoming, which has worked with DeLand, explained to me that Walmart probably wouldn't release its personnel rules to me-so why should county jails?\n\nJails are keeping more than their rules out of the public eye. When the Utah State Records Committee sided with DeLand, it also found that Davis County had no obligation to release its jail's audit reports, which would reveal whether employees were complying with the operational standards. In Utah, audit reports are typically stored with software owned by Accreditation, Audit & Risk Management Security , which is helmed by Tate McCotter, whose father, Lane, ran the Utah corrections department in the mid-1990s and worked with DeLand at Abu Ghraib. Jails in more than a dozen states, from Alabama to Pennsylvania, use the company's auditing system.\n\nAccording to DeLand, ensuring that all these records stay private improves jails' accountability. If their audit results were shared, he says, many sheriffs would not use his standards, fearing lawsuits or negative press. \"The standards have had a tremendous effect,\" DeLand told me. \"If you can find any other state where the jails have had more success than Utah has had in preventing losses in court cases, I'd sure as hell like to know.\"\n\nUtah lawmakers obtained temporary access to DeLand's standards after half a year of negotiating with him, but they were barred from releasing them to the public. The state corrections department announced in January 2018 that it would develop its own publicly accessible version of the jail guidelines. Amid a flurry of bad press, DeLand allowed the sheriffs' association to post a redacted version of his standards online. He says less than 10 percent of the material is now public.\n\nKeeping jails accountable \"is not served by moving the entire process behind a veil of secrecy,\" the ACLU's lawyers argue in their suit. They also note that opening the records could shed light on why Utah has the highest rate of jail deaths in the country: At least 25 inmates died in 2016; six were in the Davis County Jail.\n\nAfter Heather Miller's death, Davis County Jail employees were cleared of criminal wrongdoing. A spokesman for the sheriff's office defended the jail's actions. \"Our practices are sound,\" he told the Salt Lake Tribune . But in a deposition, the sheriff at the time of the incident noted that the jail had gotten rid of its health care protocols about six years earlier and hadn't developed new ones. Investigators from neighboring Weber County who looked into the incident raised a series of troubling questions: Why had the jail asked an inmate to quickly clean up the mess in Miller's cell, which should have been preserved like a crime scene? Why hadn't anyone notified her family?\n\nMiller's mother, Cynthia Stella, found out about her death not from the jail, but from her daughter's old roommate. Stella is now suing Davis County for failing to provide her daughter with adequate medical care. Early last year, she wiped away tears as she stood at a press conference to discuss Miller's death. \"I told myself I wasn't going to cry about it and I wasn't going to be emotional about this, but the thing is this: I do hold DeLand-or, I want answers from him.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Inside Colorado's Epic Battle Over a Popular Gun Safety Law\n\nWhen ex-Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale was tackled, detained, and hospitalized late last month after his wife alleged he was violent and trying to hurt himself, Fort Lauderdale police confiscated 10 firearms from his home. Candice Parscale later said that her husband \"was not violent towards me that day or any day prior,\" but police began a legal process to try to keep those guns away from Pascale for a longer time under Florida's \"red flag\" law, enacted after the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. Red flag laws like Florida's (sometimes called \"extreme risk protection orders\" or \"gun violence restraining orders\") give authorities varying abilities to temporarily seize guns from someone deemed to be an immediate threat to themselves or others, as reported by family members (or in some states, others). Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have adopted such laws, according to a count by the Trace , with many more proposed-but not without fierce opposition from gun rights groups, county supervisors, and local sheriffs' departments.\n\nOne such battleground is Colorado, which became the 17th state to enact a red flag law this year, after voters elected Democratic majorities to both houses of the state legislature. The law has been used 73 times in its first seven months, but opposition has been swift: In the aftermath, nearly half of the state's counties have declared themselves \"Second Amendment sanctuaries\" and passed local ordinances or other rules that buck the state law. The fight is now intensifying in Colorado's race for the US Senate. In Sanctuary , the latest short film in our series of election-year documentaries about gun control, produced by Chicken & Egg Pictures, director Brett Story follows a handful of Coloradans with sharply differing perspectives on the controversial issue, including a state legislator and domestic abuse survivor, a member of a local militia, and a Colorado county sheriff.\n\nThat sheriff, Weld County's Steve Reams, has become a torch bearer for a \"resistance\" movement against the law, telling a CNN crew in April that he'd rather be a prisoner in his own lockup than abide by something he views as unconstitutional. His county's board of commissioners passed a resolution to declare itself a \"Second Amendment sanctuary county\" in March . \"There's just a lot of places in the law where it can be misused or abused in a way that could absolutely negatively impact someone,\" he says in the film. \"The list of what qualifies as a household member is pretty broad. So broad that I've had an inmate in my jail attempt to file a red flag petition against me three times in the last, probably six months.\"\n\nBut state Rep. Daneya Esgar, serving Pueblo County, argues that the law is essential to preventing the escalation of domestic violence. \"We've been way too quiet for way too long when it comes to standing up for domestic violence survivors,\" she says in the film. \"And giving them a tool to keep them safe is absolutely something we need to talk about.\"\n\nThe film also shows Sandy Anderson, an organizer with the gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action, taking her message to the streets to elicit support in the form of honks from passing cars. \"As a mother of adult biracial men who are seen by society as Black men and who are constantly, from the time they were little boys, targeted, I just couldn't stand by and not do anything,\" she says. \"I do it for my kids. I do it for my nieces and nephews. I do it for my new granddaughter who will have to face this.\"\n\nAs these individuals respond to the culture war erupting over this issue in their state,  Sanctuary  offers a timely meditation on the meaning of safety in the United States today, in a state that is haunted by its own tragic share of mass shootings, from Columbine to Aurora and beyond.\n\nSanctuary is the newest addition to our library of investigative reporting on the gun violence epidemic. You can also check out our previous short documentary film in this series produced by Chicken & Egg Pictures, called I Am Not Going to Change 400 Years in Four , directed by Angela Tucker and Kristi Jacobson. It's a profile of Satana Deberry, the progressive district attorney of Durham County, North Carolina. Her election made history, but now she's grappling with what it means to run a law enforcement system that locks up people who look like her. More recently, Mother Jones published One Shot One Kill , a documentary that follows a father and two of his sons as they embark on a deer hunting trip in rural Tennessee, a deeply held family tradition that connects the Neal family to the beauty of the land, the tradition of hunting, and what it means to be both a hunter and gun owner in 2020. When a mid-hunt conversation between them turns to the Second Amendment, the trip becomes an opportunity for Peabody-nominated filmmaker Nancy Schwartzman to train her lens on how one of America's most fraught cultural battles, gun control, plays out in a single family.\n\nAbout the filmmaker:\n\nBrett Story is a filmmaker and writer based in Toronto. Her films have screened internationally at festivals such as CPH-DOX, the Viennale, SXSW, True/False, and Sheffield Doc/Fest. Her 2016 feature documentary,  The Prison in Twelve Landscapes , was nominated for a Canadian Screen Award, and her most recent feature documentary,  The Hottest August , continues to screen around the world. She is an assistant professor in the School of Image Arts at Ryerson University.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "ICE Is Giving More Local Cops the Powers of Immigration Agents. It's Been a Disaster.\n\nCharles Reed/AP\n\nLess than a week after President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, he issued executive orders packed with plans to jumpstart an immigration crackdown, including hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 5,000 new Border Patrol agents. But Trump's so-called \"deportation force\" did not stop there. To the \"maximum extent permitted by law,\" one of the orders said, his administration would also expand a long-running and long-troubled program known as 287(g), which basically turns local cops into de facto immigration officers.\n\nThe program, named after a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act , lets ICE sign agreements with local sheriff's departments empowering some of their deputies to act as \"designated immigration officers\" in local jails. Those deputies would then be allowed to interview people already locked up in the local jail, make immigration arrests, and initiate deportation proceedings against them.\n\nSince Trump's inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security has more than doubled its number of agreements, expanding the number of participating departments from 36 to 76 within 14 months, according to a new report from the DHS Office of the Inspector General. In some counties, sheriffs have paired 287(g) agreements with a federal contract to hold immigration detainees in their local jails-meaning ICE pays those departments to detain people arrested under the 287(g) program. But management and training did not keep pace with the growth of the program, according to investigators, and ICE remains unable to monitor how closely sheriffs are following the agency's own standards and whether the local officers it has deputized are even fully trained to enforce immigration law.\n\nTo untangle the details of the 287(g) program and understand the implications of the inspector general's report on how ICE is failing to monitor local departments participating in the program, I talked to Chris Rickerd, a Houston-based policy counsel working on immigration issues for the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nMother Jones: How did the 287(g) program get so big, so fast?\n\nChris Rickerd: The Obama administration used to have more agreements, close to 100, but whittled them down in part because of Department of Justice investigations into how certain jurisdictions were conducting their agreements. The most notorious [investigation] was into Joe Arpaio, [the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who was sued by the DOJ for racially profiling Latinos]. By the end, the Obama administration said 287(g) wasn't needed-in part because Secure Communities, the program that shares with DHS fingerprints of everyone who's arrested and booked into jail, was rolled out in all these facilities.\n\nTrump's executive order went back on that and said, \"We want to expand this.\" They would like, at the extreme, to have every single law enforcement agent in the country, whether they're federal, state, or local, involved in immigration enforcement. And I think they were running out in front of themselves, in terms of budget and oversight, to fulfill this executive order.\n\nMJ: Local sheriffs have to apply for a 287(g) agreement. Why do some of them choose to do it?\n\nCR: This is a politically driven expansion. This was not driven by immigration enforcement needs, neither on a national level nor on the individual locality level. [In] the jurisdictions that are being added, the sheriff wants to show he or she is tough on immigration and wants to be part of Trump's deportation force. Or, if their jail is struggling financially, they may see this as a boon and a way out. Some of the new agreements also are twinned with detention contracts : They designate certain beds in the jail as detention beds, and [ICE] pays a daily rate for them. That creates the incentive structure to book people, because the sheriff knows their bottom line is helped by having as many people as they can put into those detention beds.\n\nMJ: The new inspector general report says ICE is falling short on overseeing all these new partnerships, partially because it hasn't hired enough \"program managers.\" What are program managers, and what has gone wrong?\n\nCR: They are responsible for implementing what is called a memorandum of agreement-a very detailed, contractual-type document which requires training, reporting, and complaint mechanisms and lays out how the entire mechanism for how this is supposed to work. It's not as if designated immigration officers are outside ICE. They are supposed to report, just like an ICE agent does, through a chain of command. And that's what's really breaking down. If you don't have enough program managers, you can't oversee the agreement or [know] if there are problems.\n\nField office directors are giving additional tasks to program managers that are crowding out their already heavy load. The Texas expansion, which I think was 16 new jurisdictions, ended up with one [program manager] overstretched in fulfilling these responsibilities. That has a bottom-line effect on people who are detained and deported, and, of course, their families.\n\nMJ: The report says the problem is bigger than not having enough supervisors-it also has to do with how local officers are trained under the program. What are the issues there?\n\nCR: The certification process [for designated immigration officers] not only includes initial training, but refresher training and some online certifications that are very important in terms of immigration law, knowledge, and updates. Not only was it not tracked whether the officers were doing that online training, but those who weren't recorded as having fulfilled the requirements weren't terminated from the program, as they're required to be under ICE rules. If that's not happening then there are people who are doing 287(g) functions without proper credentialing. There isn't the correct knowledge of immigration law and procedure that is necessary for each processing.\n\nMJ: What does all this mean for the people in those communities where local law enforcement has signed a 287(g) agreement?\n\nCR: On the most pressing level, mistakes will be made in greater numbers. We've had incidents in the past of US citizens being detained . We've had people with green cards , lawful status, being put into this system. If there's not oversight, those mistakes will multiply.\n\nIn one respect, it's important to look at those jurisdictions that have rejected agreements. Just recently, the new sheriff in Charlotte, North Carolina, said he would end the agreement . We've had Harris County, which is Houston, end the agreement right at the beginning of the Trump administration. Large urban communities realize the importance to public safety of having community trust. If people know the 287(g) agreement exists and that there's entanglement between state and local police and immigration enforcement, they'll be reluctant to come forward if they are victims or witnesses or survivors of crime.\n\nMJ: ICE responded to the report by saying it was going to fix the training and management problems by next April. Will they be able to get it done?\n\nCR: I don't think it's entirely in ICE's hands to remedy some of this. They have said they asked for 40 more positions in the future budget. That hasn't been approved by Congress yet. It's hard to see how a pledge to put these reforms into effect is going to come to fruition without Congress either appropriating more or overseeing this better.\n\nMJ: Bottom line: Does this all mean more people are going to continue to be brought into ICE custody and then, potentially, deported?\n\nCR: I think that's right. You've added these 100 or so designated immigration officers. They will increase the number of people put into the deportation pipeline. That isn't some bureaucratic type of criticism of paperwork being late or something. These are the basic deportation and detention decisions that affect individuals' lives.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Sheriff Richard Mack Aims to Save America From Gun Control\n\nFormer Sheriff Richard Mack <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Richard_Mack_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\">Gage Skidmore</a>/Wikimedia Commons\n\nThis story has been updated .\n\nWhen I get on the phone with Richard Mack, better known as \"Sheriff Mack\"-NRA darling, militia hero, and former sheriff of Graham County, Arizona-he tells me he doesn't personally own that many guns. But he won't say how many: \"That's between me and the good Lord.\"\n\nMack isn't a hunter, either. For him, the specter of new gun control legislation is all about the Constitution. Which is why he has been leading an all-out crusade to prevent the federal government from taking away your firearms-if they ever were taking away your firearms. The idea is to convince  county sheriffs around the nation to refuse to enforce any new gun laws.\n\nSheriff Mack has been a celebrity amongst anti-federalist militia types and Second Amendmenters for years. In 1994, the NRA recruited him as a plaintiff in one of nine lawsuits against the Clinton administration over the 1993 Brady Law , which required federal background checks on firearms purchasers. \"The case was based on the principle that the federal government is not our boss,\" Mack says. In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled in Mack's favor, finding that federal agents may not force local law enforcement to require those background checks. In appreciation, the NRA made Mack its Law Officer of the Year and inducted him into the NRA Hall of Fame .\n\nMack has done PR work for Gun Owners of America, a gun lobby that makes the NRA seem moderate , and is on the board of the Oath Keepers (read our profile here ), which the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) calls a \"Patriot group\" made up of vets, military folks, and cops who believe the government is turning on its citizens . They vow to disobey 10 specific (and sometimes fanciful) federal orders that they consider unconstitutional, such as declarations of martial law, the herding of people into concentration camps, and the taking of guns from law-abiding citizens.\n\nMack also keeps busy on the lecture circuit, speaking to tea party groups about states' rights and gun rights. He has run for both the Senate (in 2006) and the House (last year, winning 15 percent of the vote against Texas incumbent Rep. Lamar Smith). It was the election of President Obama, Mack says, that really got him worried about government overreach. It was bad enough under Bush, what with the Patriot Act and bank bailout, but Obama, he says, has \"taken everything to the next level...Most people know his liberal tendencies and Marxist philosophies.\"\n\nSoon after the election, Mack decided to write a book about the role of sheriffs in protecting the freedoms of Americans against the feds. Its future title, County Sheriff: America's Last Hope , \"flashed in front of my vision,\" he recalls. After it was published, he sent a copy to every sheriff in the country. The book is so short, \"you can read it while you eat a donut,\" he jokes.\n\nThe SPLC's Mark Potok says Mack is irrationally worried about \"tyranny in next five minutes.\" But not all of Mack's fears are completely unfounded. (See: \"Obama\" AND \"targeted killing of American citizens.\" )\n\nIn 2011, Mack created the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA). In an echo of the Oath Keepers, its members vow to protect individual liberty and refrain from enforcing \"unconstitutional\" laws. From the start, the group has been calling up sheriffs and urging them not to enforce gun laws. But now that Obama has announced his recent executive orders on gun control and is pressing for federal legislation, Mack says the calls are incoming.\n\nThat, Mack says, is because Obama's proposals fit \"the liberal agenda of disarming Americans.\" He's worried about something he calls \"Fabianistic debauchery,\" which has to do with the slow spread of socialism . \"Obama starts talking, saying that he believes in the Second Amendment, but...\" he says. \"That's all we get from Washington, DC: 'freedom buts.' There's a double meaning there, if you catch my drift.\"\n\nThe CSPOA's list of sheriffs who vow to stand against any new gun control measures now includes more than 250 names. Mack says these include people he has contacted, or who have contacted him-or maybe they have made a public statement \"or put something on Facebook.\" But maybe not all of them are willing to go to the mat on this. \"Some are saying 'from my cold dead fingers,'\" Mack concedes, but some are more committed than others. This week, CSPOA plans to contact every sheriff in the country to find out where they stand, and then publish the list on its website.\n\nMack is adamant that he is not advocating violence. \"This whole thing is to prevent violence,\" he says. \"I have never recommended to anybody to shoot people coming to get their guns, but I have told people, 'Don't disarm.'\"\n\n\"He's basically traveling around country encouraging law enforcement everywhere to disobey federal law,\" counters the SPLC's Potok. \"So I guess that's in the eye of the beholder.\" (The SPLC has previously accused Mack of advocating violence, and later apologized. Mack sued, but the case was thrown out.)\n\nA bunch of rebellious sheriffs may not result in civil war, but experts say the movement could have a significant effect on gun law enforcement. Dennis Kenney, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, says that since local law enforcement doesn't enforce federal laws anyway, a sheriff who refused to do so wouldn't be removed-unless the federal law mandated \"applications for local law.\" In this case, if one or two guys refused to enforce the law, they would probably be fired for dereliction of duty, Kenney says, but \"it's highly unlikely that they'd remove all or thousands or hundreds of sheriffs. It would be the ultimate civil disobedience.\"\n\nPotok worries that the ideas Mack is spreading are dangerous. \"These are people who on certain occasions make life and death decisions that affect the rest of us. If they believe the federal government and law enforcement are involved in a devious plot to impose socialistic rule on us, who's to say what comes next? Is the local officer going to cooperate when federal law enforcement comes to deal with some terrorist?\"\n\nMack sees his mission much differently. He's just not going to enforce bad laws. Mack claims that if he had been around in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955, he would not have arrested Rosa Parks. He would have escorted her home safely. \"I would have put the stupid law in the trash and would have walked up to Rosa Parks and said, 'Ma'am, it would be an honor.'\" (Mack has previously associated with some racist personalities , but denies that he himself is racist. He says he \"doesn't perform background checks\" on people he talks to-including \"anti-American\" Mother Jones .)\n\nEven though he is worried about the direction of this country, Mack is jazzed at the prospect that his movement could be a barrier against the gun confiscation he believes is inevitable. He's been so busy with CSPOA that he works 12 hours a day, he says: \"It's just like best of times and the worst of times. This is the greatest opportunity we've ever been faced with to stand for our Constitution, but it's also been the worst abuse of our Constitution.\"\n\nUPDATE, Friday, February 8: After this story published, I received an email from Sheriff Mack. It is reprinted in full below:\n\nErika: I have to say for a liberal, it was pretty fair. There were no obvious distortions and that is unusual! I thank you for an honest piece. May we be blessed with peace, that's all I am after, for you and me! Anyway, if I am ever out your way I'd like to sit down and talk, maybe over lunch or coffee. I find your approach very honest. I only did not like all the space you gave SPLC. They do lie! They specialize in it! Another thing about me, as a former undercover cop, I hate the drug war! Maybe another story for another day.

Richard Graulich/The Palm Beach Post via ZUMA\n\nLet's tear our gaze away from the swamp in Washington DC and check in on the swamp of Etowah County in Alabama. Todd Entrekin, the sheriff there, just bought a vacation home for $740,000, bringing his total real estate empire to $1.7 million. Where did the money come from?\n\nEthics disclosure forms Entrekin filed with the state reveal that over the past three years he has received more than $750,000 worth of additional \"compensation\" from a source he identified as \"Food Provisions.\"\n\nFascinating. Can you tell us more?\n\nEntrekin told AL.com last month that he has a personal account that he refers to as his \"Food Provision\" fund. And Etowah County resident Matthew Qualls said that in 2015 Entrekin paid him to mow his lawn via checks with the words \"Sheriff Todd Entrekin Food Provision Account\" printed in the upper-left corner. AL.com viewed a photograph of one such check.\n\nSo the sheriff has a \"Food Provision\" fund that he uses to pay people to mow his lawn. And to buy expensive vacation homes. But how are these things related to food?\n\nThe money in the account was allocated by federal, state and municipal governments to feed inmates in the Etowah County jail, but was not used for that purpose and was instead personally pocketed by Entrekin.... Many Alabama sheriffs contend that the practice of keeping \"excess\" inmate-feeding funds for themselves is legal under a state law passed before World War II.\n\nApparently the state of Alabama makes the sheriff personally responsible for everything related to food in the jails he operates. They give him a lump sum, and he gets to keep anything left over. You know, sort of a good ol' boy slush fund that's managed to survive all the way into the 21st century.\n\nBut as much as I'd like to be outraged, this kind of penny-ante corruption is actually sort of soothing compared to what's happening in DC. It just goes to show that when rural folks complain that \"the America I know\" is slipping away, they're not seeing the whole picture.

      "text": "Sheriffs are right to stand up against demands that they do ICE's dirty work\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThis week, sheriffs across the country said that they will not do the legally dubious work of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement, even as newly sworn-in Attorney General Pam Bondi threatens prosecutions and funding cuts.\n\nSheriffs in Iowa, New York and North Carolina were among those who said they would not prioritize mass deportations.\n\nSheriffs in Iowa , New York and North Carolina were among those who said they would not prioritize mass deportations, even after Bondi threatened to cut off federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions , and acting U.S. Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove took the extraordinary step of calling for an investigation - and possible prosecution - of Tompkins County, New York, Sheriff Derek R. Osborne . At issue there is the court-ordered release of an undocumented immigrant from Sheriff Osborne's jail. Sheriff Osborne and other Tompkins County officials have affirmed that the sheriff's office followed all applicable laws, but Bove is attempting to use this case to send a warning to other jurisdictions that limit collaboration with immigration authorities.\"We will use every tool at our disposal to prevent sanctuary city policies from impeding and obstructing lawful federal operations,\" he said. But the Trump administration has a problem: Local jurisdictions have the legal discretion to make their own decisions on immigration enforcement, and sanctuary policies - which limit collaboration, rather than instructing or impeding federal authorities - are perfectly legal. That's why the Trump administration is hoping that fear and misinformation, and using threats that violate the Constitution, will cow local leaders into collaboration.\n\nAttacking sanctuary policies like the one in Tompkins County is not only cynical, it's bad policy. The evidence is clear that, when sheriffs do the job of federal law enforcement, everybody is less safe. People become afraid and less likely to report crimes. Trust decreases in government overall. Immigrants are less likely to send their kids to school.That's on top of the financial and personnel costs. Law enforcement agencies are having a hard time hiring. Terry Norris, the executive director of the Georgia Sheriffs Association , told NPR, \"Georgia sheriffs are like almost every other agency throughout the country. We have a very difficult time hiring deputies and jailers.\"\n\nSheriffs' jails are often overcrowded, with people dying every day across the country. They can ill afford to focus officers on a federal edict that won't make their communities safer. Doing the administration's job diverts local resources that could be used for substance use treatment and mental health support. Finally, immigration enforcement is complicated and increases the risk of wrongful detention, exposing sheriffs to liability and potential litigation .\n\nFor these reasons, sheriffs from Iowa to California have affirmed their unwillingness to aid the Trump administration's efforts, or have pulled back on existing collaboration with immigration authorities. Sheriffs have recommitted their concern for the safety of all residents in their counties, terminated voluntary information sharing and affirmed their commitment to doing only what the law demands on immigration. \"Our sole oath and allegiance are to the Constitution and the protection of an individual's rights,\" Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx wrote in a Facebook post in which he vowed not to honor detainer requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nBut the Trump administration has decided that it knows better than local law enforcement. The administration needs local law enforcement to reach its deportation goals. During the first Trump administration, 47% of deportations from within the United States went through jails. \"To the sheriffs in the room, we need your bed space. We need your 287(g) agreements,\" Trump \"border czar\" Tom Homan told attendees of the National Sheriff Association meeting on Saturday, referring to a program that can grant some immigration enforcement powers to officers in participating local law enforcement agencies. \"We need that force-multiplier,\" he said.\n\nThe Trump administration has decided that it knows better than local law enforcement.\n\nAlready, jails in the United States are in a state of crisis. More than 1,000 people die each year , most before they have faced trial. During the Biden administration, ICE took steps, albeit too limited, to make sure people in its custody were safe. In 2021, they revoked a contract with the Bristol, Massachusetts sheriff who was accused of assaulting incarcerated people during a disturbance in the jail. The closure followed a report from the state attorney general that found a \"callous disregard for the well-being of immigration detainees\" in the facility, citing, among other things, the use of pepper spray, flash bang grenades and dogs.The Trump administration wants to reverse that progress and go further. Homan told the sheriffs on Saturday that he would place people back in jails like Bristol, relaxing conditions under which someone can be held in ICE's custody. These promises are part of a two-prong strategy: make it easy for sheriffs eager to participate in mass deportations and make other sheriffs believe they have no choice but to collaborate.\n\nIn some places, state laws prohibit voluntary cooperation with federal immigration authorities. In other states, the law requires this activity. However, it is clear everywhere that federal law does not require that sheriffs or other local officials participate . These sheriffs do not violate federal law because they are not interfering with immigration enforcement. Under the 10th Amendment's long-standing \"anti-commandeering doctrine,\" state and local governments cannot be required to enforce federal immigration law.\n\nSheriffs and lawmakers who institute these policies are simply making a decision to prioritize other responsibilities - like focusing on the safety of their communities - rather than volunteering deputies to execute immigration authorities' mandate. They don't have to do what the Trump administration tells them to do. Despite this, Bove turned to the threat of prosecutions. Because they don't have the force of law on their side, they hope to rely on the force of fear.In Tompkins County, New York, the sheriff's office has been very clear that it has acted \" consistently with New York State law and judicial decisions , County policy, guidance of the New York Attorney General's Office, and guidance of the New York State Sheriffs' Association.\" In fact, officials there have argued that rather than any refusal to collaborate, this case was a matter of immigration authorities failing to act in a timely manner. \"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) knew exactly when the individual in question was going to be released and had every opportunity to come to the Tompkins County jail to obtain the individual in question without any need for a pursuit or other incident,\" they said in a statement.\n\nThe facts on the ground seem to matter little to a DOJ that is more interested in political theater. Their plans for mass deportation will succeed or fail based on whether they can intimidate local law enforcement leaders like Derek Osborne into carrying out their dirty work for them. It's up to all of us, attorneys and sheriffs and the public, to call them on their empty threats.\n\nSirine Shebaya is the executive director of the National Immigration Project. She is an immigrant rights litigator and advocate who focuses on the intersection of immigration, civil rights, and racial justice. Under her leadership, the National Immigration Project combines movement-centered litigation, policy advocacy, narrative change, and training and education strategies to defend and advance the rights of immigrant communities of color. Sirine has led successful campaigns and lawsuits to disentangle local law enforcement from immigration enforcement, to expand protective policies at the federal level, and to challenge federal, state and local laws that harm immigrants.\n\nMax Rose is the executive director of Sheriff Accountability Action, which works alongside grassroots organizers across the country to end mass incarceration and stop deportations while building progressive political power. Max lives in Durham, N.C. and is on the board of directors at DataWorks NC. His writing, in the American Prospect, Washington Monthly, and academic publications, has focused on racism, place and justice.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Right-wing sheriffs are doing some really shady political organizing against the election system\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe New York Times recently published a must-read investigation into right-wing activist efforts to organize county sheriffs for the purpose of challenging the electoral system based on 2020 election rigging disinformation . So far these efforts are relatively small, but they're more worrisome for what they could grow into: a powerful tool for delegitimizing the voting system, and even a basis for police units to become right-wing paramilitaries instead of enforcers of the law.\n\nIt's yet another sign of the right's efforts to seriously organize and mobilize to destroy the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nAccording to the Times, two conservative sheriffs' groups - Protect America Now and the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association - have already joined this agenda.\n\nThis is not quite an emergency yet, but it is deeply troubling, because it's yet another sign of the right's efforts to seriously organize and mobilize to destroy the integrity of the electoral process. It's one thing to make noise about not trusting elections as an individual. It's another thing to band together with others and think up strategies for meddling in them. And to have powerful law enforcement officials as the people banding together means that this could spiral well beyond a typical symbolic show of dissent.\n\nPer the Times, three sheriffs affiliated with these groups, from Michigan, Kansas and Wisconsin, have butted heads with election officials when the sheriffs pursued investigations into 2020 election fraud, including an effort to \"charge state election officials with felonies for measures they took to facilitate safe voting in nursing homes during the pandemic.\" (That effort has taken up hundreds of hours of work for the sheriff.)\n\nThe groups are hosting conferences, running television ads , and advocating for increased police presence at polling locations. As the Times reports, Protect America Now has partnered with conservative vote-monitoring Texas nonprofit True the Vote, which has spread unsubstantiated and debunked voter fraud claims, to raise \"$100,000 toward a goal of $1 million for grants to sheriffs for more video surveillance and a hotline to distribute citizen tips.\"\n\nThe rise of increasingly radical police forces inspired by radical sheriffs across the nation poses real dangers in the future. The Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association website emphasizes that sheriffs have \"the Constitutional authority to check and balance all levels of government within the jurisdiction of the County\" and that they're meant to be \"protecting your rights against any incursions of the state and federal government.\" That kind of posture is pretty potent in a context in which political polarization has caused public officials to ignore customs of upholding and enforcing the law.\n\nLaw enforcement could be doing much more important things with their time than chasing after nonexistent problems.\n\nThe potential for danger is clear. Some police forces could be less willing to intervene to stop right-wing vigilante violence in response to another election contested by Republicans. (Think about the police's chummy relationship with vigilante Kyle Rittenhouse , but on a far larger scale.) Or if police actually do end up securing more access to polling locations - a practice with a dark history of voter intimidation of Black voters - they have greater capacity to sabotage or add more credibility to false claims of voter fraud. (If this political movement didn't need real evidence of 2020 fraud, why would they need it in the future?)\n\nThese kinds of organizing efforts also increase the odds that in the event of a really dicey situation - a prolonged period of uncertainty about election results, accompanied by street fighting, let's say - that some police forces go rogue and operate independently from the state to enforce far right claims of an illegitimate election. I don't think that that scenario is necessarily likely right now, but it is plausible.\n\nEven if some of these early efforts don't amount to much - let's say none of the sheriff investigations in this stage of organizing ever end up successfully resulting in a criminal charge - they still further taint the electoral process and election officials with an aura of controversy and untrustworthiness in the eyes of many citizens.\n\nThis is to say nothing of wasted manpower; law enforcement could be doing much more important things with their time than chasing after nonexistent problems. Much like with the Republican efforts to create \"election police\" in some states, the optics are designed to make institutions look shady even if the premise for the effort is meritless.\n\nZeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

Sometimes this is because of victories like bail reform. But foes of mass incarceration don't always benefit.\n\nThe bond office at Division 5 of the Cook County Department of Corrections is empty on September 18, 2023, in Chicago.\n\nLast year, two sheriffs located in the suburban Chicago counties of Kane and Kendall got together to talk about how they wanted to respond to the financial hit their departments were set to take from forthcoming bail reform legislation being implemented by the Illinois government. One solution: shut down one of their jails and consolidate the incarcerated population in the other jail.\n\nFor Kendall County Sheriff Dwight Baird, it was simply a numbers decision. \"You start looking at the numbers,\" Baird told me in an interview, saying he wondered, \"How can we, number one, save money and still serve the citizens of our county?\"\n\nOn September 18, 2023, after a protracted battle in the courts, Illinois became the first state to adopt a cashless bail system . Bail reform has been implemented in New Jersey and New York, but now Illinois has the strongest legislation of any state in the country.\n\nThe Kendall County jail has a capacity for 200 people, but typically only holds 50-60 county residents, which Sheriff Baird expected could drop by as much as 30 percent with bail reform. He worked out an arrangement with Sheriff Ron Hain to send his shrinking jail population to Kane County, which has a larger jail and more programs. A four-year contract was approved agreeing to a $75 per diem rate for each person. Sheriff's deputies will transport people back and forth.\n\nThe deal is expected to save Kendall County $1.5 million in the first year, plus $2 million in needed renovations. It is simply more cost-effective for the county than running its own jail.\n\nIt's not just Illinois. Jails across the country have reached a state of \" complete meltdown ,\" the result of a confluence of factors-aging facilities, the Covid-19 pandemic, staffing shortages, and overcrowding among them. Now, bail reform-which naturally reduces the headcount in some jails and weakens their status as a source of revenue-is having a ripple effect as well, in ways that criminal justice reform advocates can both appreciate and be worried by.\n\nA growing number of small communities are considering closing their jails or have closed them already, whether because of bail reform or some of the other issues plaguing the system. But some counties are taking advantage of these changes, entering into contracts with smaller jails to house their incarcerated people at a per diem rate to fill empty beds.\n\nIn some places, the problem is framed as an employment issue. In Minnesota, the frequent turnover of staff has led administrators to deem small jails \" not sustainable .\"\n\nElsewhere, the language about keeping jails open amounts to thinly veiled rhetoric opposing the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nSheriff Jeff Shrader, of Jefferson County, Colo., blamed the \" national dialogue \" that followed George Floyd's death. After budget cuts in 2020 forced him to close a wing of his jail, Shrader made the unfounded assertion that it would put more criminals on the streets and cause a rise in crime.\n\nThe closure of a jail is theoretically something that can be celebrated by opponents of mass incarceration. But in the absence of more far-reaching reforms, closures can also become a symbol of the resiliency of mass incarceration, even in the face of abolitionist organizing. They can bring new problems, as incarcerated people are moved further away from their families and legal counsel. Other reform-minded sheriffs could profit from these changes, and argue for more \" safe \" jails-a clear oxymoron.\n\nNew Jersey was the first state to see several jail closings in the wake of bail reform, with varied results. In 2014, New Jersey passed bail reform legislation after negotiations between Republican Governor Chris Christie and the Democratic legislature; the law took effect January 1, 2017.\n\nAmong the 21 counties in New Jersey, five have closed their jails-Union, Gloucester, Cumberland, Hunterdon , and Passaic -and one, Somerset , is considering closing its jail, which is holding only 125 people, one-third of its capacity.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nUnion County signed an agreement in 2021 to send its 300 people to nearby Newark to be detained in the Essex County jail. The proposal was presented as a win-win situation, with Union County saving more than $100 million over five years.\n\n\"The bail reform policies enacted by New Jersey before the pandemic resulted in fewer people being held at county correctional facilities,\" the Essex County executive said in a press release. The Union County jail now merely serves as an intake center and has otherwise been shut down.\n\n\"I am someone who when I hear about a jail closure,\" said Alex Shalom, attorney at the ACLU of New Jersey, \"I figuratively jump for joy.... Newark, which is where the Essex County jail is, has widely available public transportation, there's parking at the jail. That was a consolidation that we think, worked out well.\"\n\nIn anticipation of state bail reform, in 2013, Gloucester County, a rural county in South Jersey, was the first to take action and \"regionalize\" its jail. A year later, the decision was hailed as a success . The deal saved Gloucester County $11 million in the first year, and a projected quarter of a billion dollars over the next 25 years. But the proposal was met with opposition from the police union that feared losing jobs, and the state Public Defenders Office that complained about transport times to visit clients.\n\nCumberland County, also in South Jersey, was more problematic. In 2021, a judge ruled against an injunction that had blocked the county from closing its jail. Now, approximately two-thirds of those in custody are held in Hudson County, which is a two-and-a-half-hour drive to the opposite end of the state.\n\n\"It definitely impacts the attorney-client relationship,\" Fletcher Duddy, an attorney for the New Jersey State Public Defenders Office, said in an interview. Duddy said that it's hard to quantify the impact on the outcome of a case. \"Are more people being convicted, or not? I don't know.\"\n\nIn New York, bail reform has been hotly contested. Most recently, Governor Kathy Hochul announced a third rollback to the state's bail system that gives judges greater discretion.\n\nIn the first month after the original law took effect January 1, 2020, jail populations went down 20-30 percent. Other counties were already jailing fewer people , some as much as 40 percent less. With the empty space, the sheriff in Albany County converted a wing of the jail into a homeless shelter.\n\nStill, in the face of these falling numbers, counties upstate are still pushing jail projects. In Erie County, home to Buffalo, the sheriff is lobbying for a new $200 million jail and the county executive has already allocated $2.5 million to the idea. Although the jail population is currently around 800 people, they are planning for a new facility with a capacity for 1,500.\n\nYet bail reform has changed the conversation. With the falling number of incarcerated people, activists have new ammunition to argue against jail expansion.\n\nA letter calling for \"no new jail,\" was cowritten by Jerome Wright, who spent three decades in prison, and is now a board member at VOICE Buffalo . The letter was endorsed by some 30 organizations.\n\n\"The world is moving towards decarceration,\" Wright said in an interview. Buffalo was ignoring the larger trends. \"If you get 1,500 [beds], you're going to find a way to get 1,500 people to be in there. Bail reform be damned.\"\n\nBack in Illinois, Kane County Sheriff Ron Hain promotes himself as a reformer who has brought many \" innovative \" programs to his jail. Hain explained to me that when he came into office in 2019, he created \"a litany of different programming, employment training, and then employment placement, and addiction reentry support.\" He has opened a recovery pod to offer services.\n\nHe successfully convinced Kendall County to send their jail population, along with money to house the additional people. Only a handful of men and women have been moved, with more to be transferred as bail reform goes into effect. The Kane County jail can hold 640 people but is only at half its capacity.\n\nHain said he is sympathetic to those in his jail who have \"never been given an opportunity in their life.\" Whether he is sincere, or merely rebranding incarceration, remains to be seen. A punitive court system and long terms of incarceration are still the common responses to the problems in communities impacted by issues drug addiction, poverty, and gun violence.\n\nJerome Wright is doubtful that recovery, for example, can ever happen in jail. \"A troubled mind alone in his cell by himself,\" Wright said, \"is a recipe for suicide, self-harm, and recidivism.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Waco, a city of about 145,000 people in east Texas, situated halfway between Dallas and Austin, was the scene 30 years earlier of a bloody showdown between federal and state law enforcement officers and the heavily armed Branch Davidian cult, a siege that left scores of Branch Davidians dead in a suicidal conflagration. Since those events, which began on February 28 and ended on April 19, 1993, Waco has become iconic in the memory of far-right, violence-prone militia groups, and it inspired a militia-affiliated extremist, Timothy McVeigh, to explode a truck bomb in Oklahoma City exactly two years later, on April 19, 1995, that killed 168 people and injured 680.\n\nBy selecting Waco as his campaign kickoff event, Trump sent an unmistakable signal to violence-prone extremists nationwide. The Houston Chronicle , in an editorial about Trump's rally, wrote that the choice of Waco went far beyond a \"dog whistle\" and compared it to \"the blaring of air horn of a Mack 18-wheeler barreling down I-10,\" adding that Trump was \"stoking the fires of Waco.\"\n\nIn his speech, Trump fed his audience the red meat that many of them were looking for. He opened the rally by playing a song, \"Justice for All\" by the \"J6 Choir,\" recorded by men imprisoned for the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, accompanied by footage of the mob attack. Claiming that the United States has been taken over by \"Marxists and communists,\" Trump said ominously, \"2024 is the final battle. That's going to be the big one.\"\n\nAnd he added: \"I am your warrior.... I am your retribution.\"\n\nTrump, of course, has a long history of supporting and encouraging potentially violent supporters. In 2016, during his first campaign, he suggested that \"the Second Amendment people\"-i.e., his gun-owning backers-might be able to stop the nomination of Democratic Supreme Court choices. In 2019, he said, \"I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump-I have the tough people, but they don't play it tough-until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.\" And in 2020 Trump famously told the Proud Boys militia to \"stand back and stand by.\" Ultimately, the Proud Boys would help lead the January 6 insurrection.\n\nSuch rhetoric has led many people to warn that Trump, an authoritarian favored by white supremacists, is a fascist, or proto-fascist, and that stopping him in this year's election is essential to prevent the erosion of democracy, end runs around the US Constitution, and the beginning of a slide toward fascism in America. But one thing that Trump doesn't have, so far at least, is something that both Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler could count on in their parallel ascents to power in the early 1920s: a reliable force of street thugs and paramilitary units that he and his allies can deploy against Trump's \"enemies,\" from the Democrats (\"Marxists and communists\") to immigrants, racial minorities, LGBTQ organizations, and that \"enemy of the people,\" the media.\n\nCertainly, Trump has summoned US militias and other extremists to his cause. In 2020, for instance, at the height of nationwide protests against lockdowns, mask requirements, and school closures at the start of the coronavirus crisis, Trump issued a series of viral tweets urging his followers to \"liberate\" Michigan, Minnesota, and Virginia, where armed adherents were mobilizing in street demonstrations. For instance, on April 17, 2020, Trump tweeted-characteristically, in all caps-\"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\" Soon afterwards, gun-toting Trump supporters invaded the state capitol in Lansing. Most egregiously, he called on supporters to gather in Washington on January 5-6, 2021-\"Be there, will be wild\"-for a rally that ended in the occupation of the Capitol and led to Trump's impeachment.\n\nYet so far Trump's interaction with militia groups and what the US Department of Justice calls \"domestic violent extremists\" has been mostly at arms-length, and the national militia movement is leaderless and inchoate. But America is heading into an election as a bitterly divided nation in which a substantial portion of the populace believes that violence may be necessary. According to a survey by the University of Chicago's Project on Security & Threats, as many as 14 percent of Americans say that violence is justified to \"achieve political goals that I support,\" and 4.4 percent-that's more than 11 million US adults-agree that \"the use of force is justified to return Donald Trump to the presidency.\"\n\n\"We are in such an extremely polarized country, where more and more issues are seen as zero-sum, that we are in a tinderbox state where anything can set people off,\" says Mark Pitcavage, who's spent decades studying far-right extremists for the Anti-Defamation League, and who says that Trump's entry in politics has politicized the militia movement. \"It's like we're standing outside a building filled with explosives and hoping nobody's smoking inside.\"\n\nMussolini's Blackshirts and Hitler's Brownshirts both started small.\n\nIn the 1920s, in a Europe devastated in the aftermath of World War I, seething with resentment over the losses suffered and, especially in Germany, its humiliating defeat, ultranationalists and right-wing zealots emerged out of battles with socialists and communists. The far right was bolstered by the support of businessman, landowners, and a ruling elite that saw the growing violence of its streetfighters as a battering ram against the left.\n\nThe street force that would catapult Benito Mussolini into power started with only a few thousand men. But the would-be Italian dictator was charismatic and had an angry, alienated populace to rally to his side, many of whom were already predisposed toward violence. During Italy's Black Years (1920-21), self-organized gangs of street thugs began taking shape in a few urban centers, under the rubric of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento, a decentralized militia-like organization established by Mussolini. Calling themselves squadristi , many of them donned ragtag uniforms, carried rifles and revolvers, and began a pattern of systematic small-scale attacks against their political opponents on the left.\n\nSquadrism had its first major success in the city of Ferrara, northeast of Bologna, where they crushed Ferrara's socialists and trade unionists, smashing printing presses, invading union halls, intimidating local officials, and beating and torturing prominent leftists, and then in Bologna. As historian John Foot writes in his book, Blood and Power: The Rise and Fall of Italian Fascism , \"The disintegration of local democracy in Bologna would be a model which was exported across Italy from that moment on.\" Membership in the Blackshirts grew exponentially after that. Hundreds of squads formed across Italy, in units of 30 to 50 men. In 1922, 16,000 Blackshirts led the March on Rome, and Mussolini was named prime minister. \"This is the violence of which I approve,\" announced Mussolini. \"This is the violence of Fascism.\" By the end of 1922, the number of Blackshirts would rise to 200,000. Mussolini inflated those numbers a bit in his first speech to parliament, claiming the support \"of 300,000 young people, armed to the teeth, ready in an almost mystical way to follow my orders.\"\n\nMeanwhile, while conditions in Germany in the early 1920s differed significantly from those in Italy, Adolf Hitler modeled his Brownshirts on Mussolini's Blackshirts, and they served in a similar function: to unleash violence against the left. In 1923, Hitler boasted: \"If a German Mussolini is given to Germany, people would fall down on their knees and worship him more than Mussolini has ever been worshipped.\"\n\nAs with the Blackshirts, the Nazi Brownshirts, called the Sturmabteilung (SA), or Storm Division, was tiny at first, established by Hitler as a kind of bodyguard formation to protect Hitler's speeches in beer halls. It drew its recruits from a pool of German rightists called the Freikorps (Free Corps), a 400,000-strong, ultra-violent paramilitary militia that engaged in mass killing of socialists and communists in the immediate aftermath of World War I. Some of its members, mostly in Munich, were recruited by Hitler into his \"hall protection\" squad, first called the \"Gymnastic and Sports Section\" and finally the SA. Initially, the beer-hall brawlers who gravitated to Hitler at his Hofbrauhaus events numbered at most a few dozen, and they engaged in brutal fights with clubs and truncheons against dissenters and protesters. By 1922, the SA had grown steadily, and its first major success came in November 1922 during \"German Day\" in Coburg, a town on the Itz River in Bavaria, when 800 SA storm troopers marched through the streets of Coburg carrying swastika banners and, using violence, seized effective control of the city. By March 1923, when Hitler named Hermann Göring to head the SA, it was a well-disciplined militia of just 3,000 men.\n\nIt's hard not to draw a parallel between the SA's role in protecting Hitler's beer hall events and the emergence of the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and the Three Percenters-all paramilitary-like groups-as unofficial bodyguards and security for Trump. According to Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \"The Oath Keepers provided security to Trump campaign rallies and events in Texas, Minnesota, Washington, DC, and elsewhere at regular intervals between 2016 and 2020.\"\n\nDuring and after Trump's presidency, gun-toting protesters occupied several state capitols, organized militias at the US-Mexican border to combat what Trump called an \"invasion,\" mobilized militia-like formations to engage in street fights with antifa and the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that followed the murder of George Floyd, and created self-defined protection units to defend business owners who opposed pandemic-imposed lockdowns and closures.\n\nAnn Coulter, who called the Proud Boys \"brawny, tattooed brutes,\" invited a 20-man squad of Proud Boys to protect her at a speech at UC Berkeley in 2020. And Roger Stone, the inveterate right-wing mischief maker and Trump ally who's maintained close ties to the Proud Boys, used the Oath Keepers, another far-right militia, as a personal security detail on January 6, 2021. The Proud Boys \"lined up behind Donald Trump and were willing to commit violence on his behalf,\" said a federal prosecutor involved in charging those involved in the January 6 attack. \"The defendants saw themselves as Trump's army.\"\n\nThe armed occupation of the Michigan state capitol in 2020 was carried out by the Michigan Liberty Militia, the Michigan Proud Boys, and others, carrying semiautomatic assault rifles (Two men arrested in that action were later charged in a plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer.) Only 13 states have elected to regulate or restrict open carrying of weapons, making it difficult or impossible to prevent armed demonstrators from intimidating opponents. Similar armed rallies, focused on militant opposition to Covid-19 restrictions, were also held inside statehouses in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and armed demonstrations erupted in the streets of Salt Lake City, Denver, Pittsburgh, and Dallas, according to a compilation by Everytown for Gun Safety. And in January 2020, the Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL), a militant pro-gun group, led a massive, armed march and rally in Richmond, Virginia, to protest gun safety legislation, in concert with militias and the boogaloo movement . \"We welcome our militia brothers and sisters,\" said the VCDL. According to the Everytown report, \"Militia groups descended on Richmond [and] organized a conference the day before, titled 'The State of the Militia' at which various militia leaders spoke, including those who had helped plan the [Unite the Right] event in Charlottesville.\"\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nJeet Heer\n\nAccording to a research report by Everytown and the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), a broad-based, international research group that tracks political violence worldwide and monitors scores of militias and other actors in the United States, between January 2020 and June 2021 \"at least 560 demonstrations included the presence of an armed individual, other than law enforcement.\" Sixty-seven of those involved the boogaloo boys, 56 the Three Percenters, and 42 the Proud Boys.\n\nAt least 20 states have laws on the books permitting the open carrying of weapons inside the state capitol. One state that does not is Oklahoma. Don Spencer, the leader of the Oklahoma Second Amendment Foundation, complained that despite his organization's lobbying efforts, the state legislature has blocked a bill that would allow it. \"We have introduced Capitol Carry, but the Republicans\"-he calls them RINOs-\"kill it every time,\" said Spencer, in an interview with The Nation . \"All the states around us have it, Texas, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri. We had a rally in support of Capitol Carry on the grounds of the state capitol, and a few hundred people carrying all kinds of weapons showed up.\"\n\nBy one measure, since 2020 the organized militia movement and the universe of armed, right-wing anti-government groups has suffered significantly. The militia movement took a big hit in August 2020, when Facebook took unilateral action to deplatform the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and the Three Percenters. \"For the militia movement, this was a body blow, and a lot of the groups simply collapsed, lost track of their members, couldn't recruit, and new groups couldn't form,\" says the ADL's Pitcavage. At the time of the deplatforming, the Oath Keepers had 536,839 followers on Facebook, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nThen, in the wake of January 6, a nationwide manhunt by the FBI, the arrest of scores of top leaders from the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, and greater attention from state and local law enforcement drove militia members, armed citizen groups, and violence-prone lone-wolf activists into hiding. Many went underground, making them harder to track, and online they formed closed groups or met mostly in person, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. \"January 6 mostly destroyed the largest one, the Oath Keepers, and it has not managed to reconstruct itself,\" Pitcavage says.\n\nBut the pool of potentially violent Trump supporters is still enormous. (Those half-million Oath Keeper followers are still around.) In 2021, The New York Times , citing law enforcement analysts, reported that anywhere from 15,000 to 20,000 people belong to militias in as many as 300 groups, and that, worryingly, one-fourth of those are veterans or active-duty military personnel. The Proud Boys, virtually decapitated after January 6, reverted to local chapters. Julie Farnam, the CEO of Pandorus Intelligence LLC, is a veteran of the Homeland Security Department and before and during the January 6 insurrection she was the acting director of intelligence for the US Capitol Police, where her warnings about the coming storm went unheeded. In an interview with The Nation , Farnam said that there are at least 154 local, decentralized chapters of the Proud Boys in 48 states with a robust communications system via Telegram. \"They are still hyper-aware of what Donald Trump is saying and doing,\" says Farnam, who's closely monitoring their activity.\n\n\"The movement is reverting back to a local and regional structure, but they're still engaged in equipping their followers in tactical gear and training in the woods,\" Travis McAdam, senior researcher for the SPLC, told The Nation . The SPLC currently tracks 51 organized militias, part of what it describes as \"more than 1,500 hard-right extremist groups operating across the country.\"\n\nAt least one recent attempt was launched this year to create a national militia under the name National American Patriot and Liberty Militia (NAPALM) and its parallel name, the National Constitutional Militia. It's being organized by Jake Lang, currently in jail on charges of assaulting law enforcement officers with a baseball bat on January 6, along with a host of extremists and white nationalists. Recruiting online on Instagram and X, the militia claims to have enlisted 25,000 people, but according to Wired its ranks are more like 2,500. But it drew a bizarre endorsement video on X from Patrick Byrne, the multimillionaire Trump supporter and former CEO of Overstock.com : \"It's time we form up militias, well-organized militias, ideally that we umbrella out to help maintain law and order,\" said Byrne. \"There's a wonderful organization started by Jake Lang but supported by hundreds of sheriffs and many of the big names in the liberty movement...and it's called NAPALM.\"\n\nWhat's especially worrisome is that conservative elected officials, sheriffs, and Republican Party offices are tacitly, and sometimes even explicitly, cooperating with, encouraging and supporting militia groups. The membrane that has long separated the state and local governments from nongovernmental and private ultra-right actors, including violence-prone ones, is becoming increasingly porous.\n\nRachel Kleinfeld is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Democracy, Conflict, and Governance Program and an expert on political violence. In an interview with NPR's On Point and in an essay for Just Security called \"The GOP's Militia Problem,\" Kleinfeld said that militias in many parts of the country are going mainstream. \"So what we're seeing is in Republican counties, often local officials, occasionally state level, we're starting to see a willingness to work with militias,\" she said. Members of local chapters of the Proud Boys have muscled into GOP organizations from Miami to Kansas, North Carolina, central California, and Oregon, running for office, backing candidates, and taking over local party organizations. The chairman of the Wyoming GOP, Frank Eathorne, is a former member of the Oath Keepers.\n\nIn a recent report, ACLED emphasized the role of official toleration of militias in allowing them to prosper: \"The lack of open sanctions on these groups from public figures and select local law enforcement has allowed them space to operate while concurrently allowing public figures to claim little direct responsibility for violent actions from which they hope to benefit.\"\n\n\"It would be foolish to underestimate the power of Trump's comments to call rogue militias to action,\" wrote Mary McCord, in essay for Lawfare five years ago. \"The militia movement has shown that it will take action based on the president's statements.\"\n\nComing 15 months before the January 6 insurrection, McCord's words were prophetic. Since then, McCord has emerged as Paul Revere-like figure as the executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (ICAP) at Georgetown Law School. A former acting assistant US attorney general for national security, McCord was appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi as legal counsel to the US House task force charged with investigating the events of January 6. And ICAP has since engaged in a whirlwind of legal briefs, model legislation, and warning letters to states and localities about militia-like activities, along with detailed research about the threat posed by radical anti-government groups.\n\nIn an interview with The Nation , McCord says that she has documented a kind of \"call-and-response, dog-whistle\" pattern that allowed Trump to summon armed support groups to his cause, and that his insistence that the 2020 election was rigged has created a dangerous climate for 2024. \"If he doesn't win, he's been planting the seeds of a false narrative that people with AR-15s are listening to,\" she says. \"A lot of what happens is up to Trump and what words he uses, and to what extent does he call people to engage in violence.\"\n\nMcCord stresses that despite the Second Amendment, which refers to a \"well-regulated militia,\" militias and militia-like organizations are illegal in all 50 states. In the landmark 2008 Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller , in which the court supported the most conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment and gun ownership, Justice Antonin Scalia also wrote that that amendment \"does not prevent the prohibition of private paramilitary groups.\" Yet, says McCord, laws against militias are never enforced, partly because local officials misinterpret the law, partly because militias thinly disguise their activities, and partly because many local law enforcement agencies are broadly sympathetic.\n\n\"Private militias continue to recruit, train, and deploy largely unimpeded,\" said McCord, in testimony to a House subcommittee. \"This is so even when they openly acknowledge their intent to serve as an armed counterforce to what they view as tyrannical government action.\"\n\nProviding the background music for the militia movement and a wide range of other extreme right, anti-government groups is the granddaddy of them all, the National Rifle Association. Though in recent years the far right has been moved to action over the immigrant \"invasion,\" Covid-19 restrictions, and election fraud conspiracies, no other issue galvanizes the right more than gun safety measures and fears that Democrats are scheming to disarm gun owners.\n\nAnd at the local level, in parallel with the NRA itself, a group calling itself the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association (CSPOA) has emerged to unite elected government officials-that is, the nation's 3,000 elected sheriffs, one in each of America's 3,000 counties-and pro-militia armed citizens. Founded in 2011 by Richard Mack, then sheriff of Graham County, Arizona, CSPOA claims that in each country the sheriff is \"sovereign,\" and can exert law enforcement powers that exceed both federal and state authorities-and includes the refusal to enforce federal and state gun laws. Though its membership rolls are secret, at least 69 sheriffs have been identified as CSPOA members, and in a survey conducted by the Arizona Center for Investigating Reporting, 200 of the 500 sheriffs surveyed said that they agreed with CSPOA's ideology. Its current CEO, Sam Bushman, operates Liberty News Radio, a forum for white nationalists, where Bushman has hosted Stewart Rhodes, the Oath Keepers' founder, multiple times. (Rhodes is currently serving an 18-year sentence for his role in the January 6 insurrection.)\n\nMack, its founder, was a former member of the Oath Keepers board of directors, and since leaving that post he's maintained ties with the Oath Keepers and other parts of the militia movement. The CSPOA encourages its members to enlist local armed citizens in what they call a \"posse,\" essentially a sheriff-sponsored militia that can be called up, say, to confront protesters or riots. Sheriff Bob Songer of Klickitat County, Washington, for instance, a CSPOA board member, claims to have assembled a posse of 150 men, after telling the feds to \"stay out of our county.\" Songer, a far-right personality with a wide following, has worked with a pro-militia organization called Patriot Prayer, which is closely tied to the Proud Boys.\n\nWhat's especially worrisome about CSPOA and its member sheriffs' efforts, like Songer's, to recruit local civilians to posses is that provides a connection point between the militia movement and local governments. According to Georgetown's McCord, CSPOA has \"advocated for county recognition of local militias.\" And in one recent case, in Nassau County, Long Island, just outside New York City, a pro-Trump county executive and the local sheriff made news recently when the executive, Bruce Blakeman, placed an ad asking for local gun-license holders to sign up to be deputized as a civilian law enforcement adjunct force. The priority, he said, would be for ex-military and former law enforcement personnel, who'd earn $150 per day for their participation. In an interview with WPIX-TV, Blakeman said that the force could be called up \"if there was a riot.\"\n\nIn a petition on Change.org , local opposition groups condemned the recruitment scheme which, the petition said, \"has all the earmarks of a MAGA militia.\" Sabine Margolis, a local activist who initiated the petition, told The Nation in an interview that 2,000 people, more than 90 percent of whom are locals, have signed it so far. Despite her efforts, Blakeman and the local sheriff have ignored the protests, and she said that \"they're still recruiting, they're still training.\" Margolis added: \"I'm German. This stinks to high heaven. It's just like Germany in the 1930s. He's playing with the dictator playbook.\"\n\nLike the sheriffs' organization, the NRA has had ties to the militia movement, and one of its former board members, right-wing rocker Ted Nugent, was a vocal defender of the Michigan Militia. \"Leaders of the Oath Keepers have also appeared at NRA events,\" said an Everytown report. \"The NRA holds its annual Great American Outdoor Show, an expo for hunters, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. At every show between 2014 and 2018, the Pennsylvania chapter of the Oath Keepers had a booth at the event.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, in 2024 the NRA has given Trump its endorsement. Of course, after a decade of controversy, financial troubles, and high-profile lawsuits against it, the NRA has lost a significant about of its clout. Still, the organization, once topping 6 million members, can still boast of 4.2 million, and will spend millions of dollars in the 2024 election. On February 9, Trump appeared at the NRA's Great American Outdoor Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, telling the crowd, \"They are coming to get your guns,\" and announcing the creation of Gun Owners for Trump. And on May 18, Trump traveled to the NRA's annual convention in Dallas, Texas, where he predicted \"death and destruction like never before\" if he isn't elected in November.\n\nWhether Trump could and whether he intends to rally armed right-wing extremists on his behalf-especially were he to lose the election in November-is something that is unknowable. But the very fact that it's conceivable does indeed invoke the specter of It Can't Happen Here .\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

A military strategist sometimes called \"the Machiavelli of Maryland,\" Luttwak is the author of a curious how-to book titled Coup D'État: A Practical Guide (1968). This manual, Luttwak assures readers, \"can be compared to a cookery book in the sense that it aims at enabling any layman equipped with enthusiasm-and the right ingredients-to carry out his own coup.\" At least one aspiring usurper seems to have consulted this volume. Luttwak likes to tell the story of how, in the midst of a failed coup in 1972, Moroccan Gen. Mohammad Oufkir was assassinated with a copy of the book in his possession. (Skeptics might note that the anecdote would have been more impressive if Oufkir's attempted ouster of the Moroccan king had succeeded). Aside from the theoretical knowledge evinced in his book, Luttwak was also a firsthand participant in Donald Trump's desperate attempt to hold on to power. On December 14, 2020, Luttwak was part of a group of Trump supporters appointed to the Defense Policy Board, a last-minute bureaucracy-packing appointment seen as a Trumpian effort-albeit a typically ill-conceived and ineffectual one-to gain control over the military. Writing in The Wall Street Journal on January 7, 2021, Luttwak gave a low grade to the \"aborted insurrection\" of the previous day. Like a professor dismayed by a student who had failed to learn anything, Luttwak claimed, What happened was certainly not an attempted coup d'état , either. Coups must be subterranean, silent conspiracies that emerge only when the executors move into the seats of power to start issuing orders as the new government. A very large, very noisy and colorful gathering cannot attempt a coup. More From Jeet Heer A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump April 25, 2025 This President Has Many Puppet Masters April 21, 2025 Shawn Fain for President! April 18, 2025 Even if you don't share Luttwak's politics, it's possible to agree with his basic assessment of January 6. Throughout the end of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, I described Trump as working toward a \"clown coup\"-an attempted subversion of democracy that was doomed to failure because there was no plausible mechanism for subduing the national government. One point I repeatedly stressed was that all evidence indicated that top military brass were actively resisting Trump's attempt to turn them into a private army. Without necessarily ascribing to military leaders any commitment to constitutional norms, it was clear that they viewed Trump as an unstable buffoon. This frothing former reality-show host was not a man on horseback that any serious officer would risk their career supporting in an extra-constitutional power grab. (Subsequent reporting by Susan B. Glasser and Peter Baker in The New Yorker on the strife between Trump and the Pentagon has only bolstered this assessment).

By riling up a mob to attack the Capitol, an act that led to the harming of police officers, Trump pursued a path most likely to alienate the very cadres that you need in order to seize state power by force. But if Trump was too inept to pull off a real coup, can the same be said of all his political allies? There is mounting evidence that many on the right are taking lessons from the defeat of January 6 to plan the next coup. On Thursday, Cameron Joseph reported in Vice that Blake Masters, Republican nominee in the Senate race in Arizona, told a GOP group last August that the military had to be purged. \"Your entire general class, they're left-wing politicians at this point,\" Masters said. \"It's very hard to become a general without being some kind of left-of-center politician. I would love to see all the generals get fired. You take the most conservative colonels, you promote them to general.\" The idea of American generals' being \"left-wing\" in any fashion is ludicrous, unless one believes that anyone who resists Trump's attempt to subjugate the military to his personal whims is a leftist. More worrying, the politicization of the military by elevating a cadre of ambitious junior officers is what you'd do if you were planning a coup. Related Articles Rise of the Far-Right Ultras Kim Phillips-Fein The Most Painful Episode of the January 6 Insurrection Stephen Berry \"MAGA Republican\" Is a Distinction Without a Difference Ed Burmila Luttwak's guide to coups offers guidance on this very point. In that book, Luttwak advises any would-be plotter to make lists of junior officers who have been denied promotion. \"Of course, colonels have always been prominent in military coups,\" Luttwak wryly notes. These lean and hungry types will be excellent fodder, although Luttwak warns that colonels in particular can be hard to control. The battleground of the coup is not the streets but the corridors of power. As Luttwak observes, the coup \"operates in that area outside the government but within the state which is formed by the permanent and professional civil service, the armed forces and police. The aim is to detach the permanent employees of the state from the political leadership.\" If Blake Masters is dreaming of mobilizing junior officers as recruits in a right-wing makeover of the state, the Claremont Institute is focusing its energy on another key agent of state power, sheriffs. The Claremont Institute is the most ardently Trumpist of the think tanks on the right, the home of law professor John C. Eastman, a key architect of Trump's legal strategy to overturn the 2020 election. The Claremont Institute has started a \"Sheriffs Fellowship\" to provide ideological training to sheriffs. A fundraising letter made public by Christian Vanderbrouk, a writer for The Bulwark , clarifies the ideological slant of the Sheriffs Fellowship. According to the letter, \"One big thing that the riots, lockdowns, and electoral disasters of 2020 make clear is that America and our nation's conservative movement needs a countervailing network of uncorrupted law enforcement officials.\" The letter goes on to say that \"the Sheriffs fellowship will play a central role in countering the perversion of the judicial system by which the revolutionary Left seeks to advance its totalitarian agenda.\" Vanderbrouk places the letter in the context of other Claremont Institute documents trying to legitimize the 2020 attempted insurrection and future efforts to overturn election results. Vanderbrouk concludes , \"The message is clear: do whatever it takes to crush your opponents and all will be forgiven in the second Trump term.\" In his newsletter \"Unpopular Front,\" John Ganz, a keen observer of the right, connects the Sheriffs Fellowship with two earlier far-right formations, the Posse Comitatus and the Constitutional Sheriffs movements, which both encouraged sheriffs to assert extralegal power over elected officials: Claremont has adopted this rhetoric to connect itself to the currently-existing Constitutional Sheriffs Movement , which boasts hundreds of actual county sheriffs as its members. In doing this, they are seeking to accomplish two apparent goals of their organization: the extension of a network into far-right subcultures and the development of alternate, extra-legal power structures-and now, even armed ones. It's important to be measured about the threat: Aspirations are not inevitabilities. In late 2020 and early 2021, Trump clumsily incited his followers-leading to an aborted insurrection that generated real violence but never came close to achieving its goal. Current right-wing attempts to create incentives for power-hungry colonels and sheriffs are dangerous, but they aren't guaranteed success. They demand vigilance rather than hysteria: The proper political response is to make the Republican Party pay for nursing this large seditionist faction. This has to be made a key election issue. Joe Biden's speech on the dangers of MAGA Republicans was a good start and needs to be echoed by further warnings that the sequels to the 2021 insurrection are being planned right now.\n\nAt least one aspiring usurper seems to have consulted this volume.

By riling up a mob to attack the Capitol, an act that led to the harming of police officers, Trump pursued a path most likely to alienate the very cadres that you need in order to seize state power by force. But if Trump was too inept to pull off a real coup, can the same be said of all his political allies? There is mounting evidence that many on the right are taking lessons from the defeat of January 6 to plan the next coup. On Thursday, Cameron Joseph reported in Vice that Blake Masters, Republican nominee in the Senate race in Arizona, told a GOP group last August that the military had to be purged. \"Your entire general class, they're left-wing politicians at this point,\" Masters said. \"It's very hard to become a general without being some kind of left-of-center politician. I would love to see all the generals get fired. You take the most conservative colonels, you promote them to general.\" The idea of American generals' being \"left-wing\" in any fashion is ludicrous, unless one believes that anyone who resists Trump's attempt to subjugate the military to his personal whims is a leftist. More worrying, the politicization of the military by elevating a cadre of ambitious junior officers is what you'd do if you were planning a coup. Related Articles Rise of the Far-Right Ultras Kim Phillips-Fein The Most Painful Episode of the January 6 Insurrection Stephen Berry \"MAGA Republican\" Is a Distinction Without a Difference Ed Burmila Luttwak's guide to coups offers guidance on this very point. In that book, Luttwak advises any would-be plotter to make lists of junior officers who have been denied promotion. \"Of course, colonels have always been prominent in military coups,\" Luttwak wryly notes. These lean and hungry types will be excellent fodder, although Luttwak warns that colonels in particular can be hard to control. The battleground of the coup is not the streets but the corridors of power. As Luttwak observes, the coup \"operates in that area outside the government but within the state which is formed by the permanent and professional civil service, the armed forces and police. The aim is to detach the permanent employees of the state from the political leadership.\" If Blake Masters is dreaming of mobilizing junior officers as recruits in a right-wing makeover of the state, the Claremont Institute is focusing its energy on another key agent of state power, sheriffs. The Claremont Institute is the most ardently Trumpist of the think tanks on the right, the home of law professor John C. Eastman, a key architect of Trump's legal strategy to overturn the 2020 election. The Claremont Institute has started a \"Sheriffs Fellowship\" to provide ideological training to sheriffs. A fundraising letter made public by Christian Vanderbrouk, a writer for The Bulwark , clarifies the ideological slant of the Sheriffs Fellowship. According to the letter, \"One big thing that the riots, lockdowns, and electoral disasters of 2020 make clear is that America and our nation's conservative movement needs a countervailing network of uncorrupted law enforcement officials.\" The letter goes on to say that \"the Sheriffs fellowship will play a central role in countering the perversion of the judicial system by which the revolutionary Left seeks to advance its totalitarian agenda.\" Vanderbrouk places the letter in the context of other Claremont Institute documents trying to legitimize the 2020 attempted insurrection and future efforts to overturn election results. Vanderbrouk concludes , \"The message is clear: do whatever it takes to crush your opponents and all will be forgiven in the second Trump term.\" In his newsletter \"Unpopular Front,\" John Ganz, a keen observer of the right, connects the Sheriffs Fellowship with two earlier far-right formations, the Posse Comitatus and the Constitutional Sheriffs movements, which both encouraged sheriffs to assert extralegal power over elected officials: Claremont has adopted this rhetoric to connect itself to the currently-existing Constitutional Sheriffs Movement , which boasts hundreds of actual county sheriffs as its members. In doing this, they are seeking to accomplish two apparent goals of their organization: the extension of a network into far-right subcultures and the development of alternate, extra-legal power structures-and now, even armed ones. It's important to be measured about the threat: Aspirations are not inevitabilities. In late 2020 and early 2021, Trump clumsily incited his followers-leading to an aborted insurrection that generated real violence but never came close to achieving its goal. Current right-wing attempts to create incentives for power-hungry colonels and sheriffs are dangerous, but they aren't guaranteed success. They demand vigilance rather than hysteria: The proper political response is to make the Republican Party pay for nursing this large seditionist faction. This has to be made a key election issue. Joe Biden's speech on the dangers of MAGA Republicans was a good start and needs to be echoed by further warnings that the sequels to the 2021 insurrection are being planned right now.\n\nAside from the theoretical knowledge evinced in his book, Luttwak was also a firsthand participant in Donald Trump's desperate attempt to hold on to power. On December 14, 2020, Luttwak was part of a group of Trump supporters appointed to the Defense Policy Board, a last-minute bureaucracy-packing appointment seen as a Trumpian effort-albeit a typically ill-conceived and ineffectual one-to gain control over the military. Writing in The Wall Street Journal on January 7, 2021, Luttwak gave a low grade to the \"aborted insurrection\" of the previous day. Like a professor dismayed by a student who had failed to learn anything, Luttwak claimed, What happened was certainly not an attempted coup d'état , either. Coups must be subterranean, silent conspiracies that emerge only when the executors move into the seats of power to start issuing orders as the new government. A very large, very noisy and colorful gathering cannot attempt a coup.

Current right-wing attempts to create incentives for power-hungry colonels and sheriffs are dangerous, but they aren't guaranteed success. They demand vigilance rather than hysteria: The proper political response is to make the Republican Party pay for nursing this large seditionist faction. This has to be made a key election issue. Joe Biden's speech on the dangers of MAGA Republicans was a good start and needs to be echoed by further warnings that the sequels to the 2021 insurrection are being planned right now.\n\nBut if Trump was too inept to pull off a real coup, can the same be said of all his political allies? There is mounting evidence that many on the right are taking lessons from the defeat of January 6 to plan the next coup. On Thursday, Cameron Joseph reported in Vice that Blake Masters, Republican nominee in the Senate race in Arizona, told a GOP group last August that the military had to be purged. \"Your entire general class, they're left-wing politicians at this point,\" Masters said. \"It's very hard to become a general without being some kind of left-of-center politician. I would love to see all the generals get fired. You take the most conservative colonels, you promote them to general.\" The idea of American generals' being \"left-wing\" in any fashion is ludicrous, unless one believes that anyone who resists Trump's attempt to subjugate the military to his personal whims is a leftist. More worrying, the politicization of the military by elevating a cadre of ambitious junior officers is what you'd do if you were planning a coup.

In that book, Luttwak advises any would-be plotter to make lists of junior officers who have been denied promotion. \"Of course, colonels have always been prominent in military coups,\" Luttwak wryly notes. These lean and hungry types will be excellent fodder, although Luttwak warns that colonels in particular can be hard to control. The battleground of the coup is not the streets but the corridors of power. As Luttwak observes, the coup \"operates in that area outside the government but within the state which is formed by the permanent and professional civil service, the armed forces and police. The aim is to detach the permanent employees of the state from the political leadership.\" If Blake Masters is dreaming of mobilizing junior officers as recruits in a right-wing makeover of the state, the Claremont Institute is focusing its energy on another key agent of state power, sheriffs. The Claremont Institute is the most ardently Trumpist of the think tanks on the right, the home of law professor John C. Eastman, a key architect of Trump's legal strategy to overturn the 2020 election. The Claremont Institute has started a \"Sheriffs Fellowship\" to provide ideological training to sheriffs. A fundraising letter made public by Christian Vanderbrouk, a writer for The Bulwark , clarifies the ideological slant of the Sheriffs Fellowship. According to the letter, \"One big thing that the riots, lockdowns, and electoral disasters of 2020 make clear is that America and our nation's conservative movement needs a countervailing network of uncorrupted law enforcement officials.\" The letter goes on to say that \"the Sheriffs fellowship will play a central role in countering the perversion of the judicial system by which the revolutionary Left seeks to advance its totalitarian agenda.\" Vanderbrouk places the letter in the context of other Claremont Institute documents trying to legitimize the 2020 attempted insurrection and future efforts to overturn election results. Vanderbrouk concludes , \"The message is clear: do whatever it takes to crush your opponents and all will be forgiven in the second Trump term.\" In his newsletter \"Unpopular Front,\" John Ganz, a keen observer of the right, connects the Sheriffs Fellowship with two earlier far-right formations, the Posse Comitatus and the Constitutional Sheriffs movements, which both encouraged sheriffs to assert extralegal power over elected officials: Claremont has adopted this rhetoric to connect itself to the currently-existing Constitutional Sheriffs Movement , which boasts hundreds of actual county sheriffs as its members.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Eesha Williams writes: Sheila Prue, a fourteen-year veteran Brattleboro, Vermont, police sergeant and open lesbian, won an unexpected, landslide victory in the Democratic primary for Windham County sheriff on September 10. She ran against two male veterans of the sheriff's department who spent much more money on their campaigns. One was accused of sexual misconduct by a female subordinate. Prue will face the popular Republican incumbent, Henry Farnum, in the general election. If elected, she will be the nation's first openly lesbian county sheriff. Of 3,088 elected county sheriffs in the United States, twenty-five are women, said Dean Kueter, a spokesman for the National Sheriffs' Association in Arlington, Virginia. (Send checks to Sheila for Sheriff, 128 Main Street, Suite 5, Brattleboro, VT 05301.) HOW TO ACT-NOW! We've recently put The Nation 's website through some changes, with more to come in the weeks ahead. The first change is the weblog ActNow! by Peter Rothberg, designed to help readers act on their beliefs by putting them in touch with projects and campaigns they may want to join and featuring creative ways for them to register their dissent. Whether it's another right-wing court appointment, a rush to war by a reckless Administration, a governor with his finger on the switch, a Congress intent on pushing fast-track legislation, a corporate takeover of a public water concern or the steady erosion of unbranded public space, it will help people find activists and organizers mobilizing opposition. There will be ways to write letters to Congress, to find out about progressive events, to sign on to petitions, to organize teach-ins, to e-mail talking points, to brainstorm with other activists, to push renewable energy projects, to reclaim public space and to learn about boycotts. There'll be regular focus on the organizing being done by student groups in the global justice, fair-trade and human rights movements. There will also be links to articles, to scholarly resources, to policy reports and to sites we like (http: www.thenation.com/actnow ). Sign up for EmailNation , our free electronic newsletter. BUSH'S ENRON ACCOUNTING \"Enron accounting\" appears to have been as favored by George W. Bush as by Vice President Cheney. Bush had better connections, though. When Bush's Harken Energy Corp. was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1990, as detailed in the October 9 Wall Street Journal , it formed a partnership with Harvard University's endowment arm and moved troubled assets and large debts into the new entity-thus getting them off the balance sheet. As usual, it appears to have been a case of Poppy coming to the aid of his offspring: One of the Harvard endowment's most influential board members was a political supporter. Credit for unearthing key documents goes to HarvardWatch, a student and alumni group, and the Center for Public Integrity. FOLLOW-UP A 794-page report prepared by a team of historians headed by Saul Friedländer has confirmed the charge, first made in these pages by Hersch Fischler and John Friedman (see \"Bertelsmann's Nazi Past,\" December 28, 1998), that Bertelsmann, the German communications giant, collaborated with the Nazi regime before and during World War II. Bertelsmann claimed it was forced to suspend operations during the war because it published books banned by the Nazis. Actually, as Fischler-Friedman reported, and the Bertelsmann-sponsored report confirms, it was shut down in 1944 for hoarding paper. Before that sanction, the company had made a tidy living printing books for German soldiers and religious tomes containing anti-Semitic propaganda.\n\nEesha Williams writes: Sheila Prue, a fourteen-year veteran Brattleboro, Vermont, police sergeant and open lesbian, won an unexpected, landslide victory in the Democratic primary for Windham County sheriff on September 10.

Bertelsmann claimed it was forced to suspend operations during the war because it published books banned by the Nazis. Actually, as Fischler-Friedman reported, and the Bertelsmann-sponsored report confirms, it was shut down in 1944 for hoarding paper. Before that sanction, the company had made a tidy living printing books for German soldiers and religious tomes containing anti-Semitic propaganda.\n\nHOW TO ACT-NOW! We've recently put The Nation 's website through some changes, with more to come in the weeks ahead. The first change is the weblog ActNow! by Peter Rothberg, designed to help readers act on their beliefs by putting them in touch with projects and campaigns they may want to join and featuring creative ways for them to register their dissent. Whether it's another right-wing court appointment, a rush to war by a reckless Administration, a governor with his finger on the switch, a Congress intent on pushing fast-track legislation, a corporate takeover of a public water concern or the steady erosion of unbranded public space, it will help people find activists and organizers mobilizing opposition. There will be ways to write letters to Congress, to find out about progressive events, to sign on to petitions, to organize teach-ins, to e-mail talking points, to brainstorm with other activists, to push renewable energy projects, to reclaim public space and to learn about boycotts. There'll be regular focus on the organizing being done by student groups in the global justice, fair-trade and human rights movements. There will also be links to articles, to scholarly resources, to policy reports and to sites we like (http: www.thenation.com/actnow ). Sign up for EmailNation , our free electronic newsletter. BUSH'S ENRON ACCOUNTING \"Enron accounting\" appears to have been as favored by George W. Bush as by Vice President Cheney. Bush had better connections, though. When Bush's Harken Energy Corp. was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1990, as detailed in the October 9 Wall Street Journal , it formed a partnership with Harvard University's endowment arm and moved troubled assets and large debts into the new entity-thus getting them off the balance sheet. As usual, it appears to have been a case of Poppy coming to the aid of his offspring: One of the Harvard endowment's most influential board members was a political supporter.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Rodriguez, a journalist, was in East Los Angeles reporting for an article in Lowrider magazine about police violence when four baton-wielding LA County sheriffs beat the living dreams out of him. As he recalls the incident, I remember reading about the 538 mostly young, brown kids arrested that weekend. Their crime? Cruising on Whittier Boulevard-the de facto center of the lowriding world. I have my own stories of official violence going back to the police beatings of local Latino cruisers under San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein in the 1980s. I identified with Rodriguez's story-a story the city's main news outlet, the Los Angeles Times , ignored. But I had no idea about the astonishing effects the assault would have on him decades later. \"For years, I literally couldn't remember my dreams or my nightmares,\" he tells me during our conversation last week. \"Those parts of me were erased.\" Last May, Roberto, an associate professor emeritus in the Mexican American Studies Department at the University of Arizona, released the latest iteration of one of his most important dreams: the Raza Database Project (RDP), a project aiming to document the nightmarish, violent effects of Latinx erasure. He and a team of volunteer researchers, journalists, and family members of Latinos killed by police produced a definitive report documenting an undercount of over 2,600 Latinos who have died at the hands of local police officers since 2014, a number that's twice as large as what was previously reported. There, in the cold anonymity of the statistics, he saw the mark of his old foe: erasure. Roberto Cintli Rodriguez was beat by four baton-wielding Los Angeles County Sheriffs in 1979 while reporting about police violence in East LA. \"One day,\" he says, \"I was looking at the 'Unknowns'-people not identified in any racial or ethnic category-and saw all these names I recognized: Lopez, Martinez, Gonzalez, Ramirez. I asked myself, 'Why are these people in this category?' Because the federal government doesn't keep a comprehensive, standardized count of who's killed.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal His project and story bring to mind the forgotten names and images encountered during recent drives to numerous California cities and towns: Sean Monterrosa, an unarmed man shot and killed in Vallejo on June 2, 2020; James De La Rosa, a 22-year-old oil field worker shot dead by police officers in Bakersfield (where police officers have killed more people per capita than anywhere else in the United States); Andrés Guardado, an 18-year-old Salvadoran man shot in the back and killed by the same Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department that beat Roberto. While locals know their names, these and thousands of others remain faceless and story-less in the annals of US police violence. Current Issue View our current issue \"California,\" Roberto adds \"is literally a killing field everywhere, but nobody outside our community knows it.\" Roberto's journey into the heart of darkness of police killings points to an even larger issue: how the systematic deletion of Latinx people by government databases, the media, philanthropy, Hollywood, and other institutions enables not just police violence but a whole host of other ills. From devastating immigration policies and employment discrimination, to reduced government funding and the colonization of Puerto Rico, these and other afflictions all have an element of removing Latinx people from their own stories. This institutional erasure refers to the ways institutions and society at large suppress or completely silence a group in archives and narratives, as well as in discourse that subtly dehumanizes and sets up Latinx peoples for various forms of oppression. Roberto's talk of California as a \"killing field\" is familiar to me. I recall the silences that preceded the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of Central American peasants ignored before and during and after the war of the 1980s. Since then, I have watched and documented how the nefarious workings of the removal of Salvadorans and other Central Americans from our own stories have extended across 2,500 miles of migration, mass graves, gang and narco violence and other symptoms of unstoried and devalued life. In 2018, I wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review about how most of the national coverage-on-the-ground reports, think pieces, features, op-eds-about the child refugee \"crisis\" in print and electronic media made it seem as though the crisis was \"new,\" as if the mass caging and separation of thousands of child refugees didn't begin in 2014, during the Obama years. Two researchers and I also found that the only representations of the Hondurans, Guatemalans, and Salvadorans who are at the center of this story were two-dimensional images of pain and soundbites of suffering. No Central American scholars, lawyers, nonprofit leaders, or journalists were included in any of the stories from any of the major media. Not one. And the pattern continues, as documented in a recent study by the media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. The effects of this selective official silence are hardly lost on Central Americans like Ana Luna, a Salvadoran refugee who fled gang violence only to be imprisoned with her son in the Karnes Family Detention facility by the Obama administration in 2014. When I asked her about the massive news coverage of Trump's \"border crisis\" in 2018, she responded, \"Only those imprisoned by Trump matter. It's like the thousands of us jailed by Obama never existed.\" Many fear that a similar erasure awaits the Central American refugee children and mothers being imprisoned by Biden. Columbia University scholar Frances Negrón-Muntaner listens to these stories of physical and cultural violence against Latinx peoples and hears the workings of official amnesia. \"Power always has archives,\" she says. \"Police, the state, hospitals, schools, Hollywood, the news media. Any institution that exercises power generates an archive of its founding, its operations. One of the ways Latinos are erased is that the data and stories generated by these institutions are not collected into their archives. The other form of erasure is that the materials may be there but the narratives are not there and are not incorporated into the larger narratives of the country. Latinos have both, and this creates all kinds of profoundly disturbing problems.\" In 2015, Negrón-Muntaner and a team of researchers found that while the Latinx population makes up almost 60 million people-over 17 percent of the United States-they represented only between 2 and 8 percent of the leading actors, directors, showrunners and all other key positions in the television and movie industry. A recent LA Times series on Latinx inclusion in Hollywood found that the situation has actually gotten worse since Muntaner's study. Statistics on employment in the news media show a similar trend: Latinos as the least represented group in the US news industry proportional to their population. (Disclosure: Her report includes a 2009 campaign I led to remove Lou Dobbs from CNN.) It's a fact that Muntaner sees as demanding activism. \"Ending this means confronting white supremacy.\" Though grounded in white supremacy, the practice of erasure is not just a white phenomenon, a fact Roberto knows well. \"As I started sharing the research,\" Roberto Rodriguez tells me, \"some Latinos actually asked me, \"Why you doing that? That's not our issue. Our issue is immigration, not violence.\" He and Muntaner see these responses as forms of colonialism reinforced by the selective memory of physical, psychic, and other violence. Lacking any memory of the history of killing and catastrophe that has shaped different Latinx identities in, say, the colonization of Puerto Rico or the pillaging and state terrorism (see the lynchings and murder of thousands at the hand by Texas Rangers during the Matanza in the Lone Star State) of the parts of the United States that used to be Mexico, different Latinx groups lack any serious explanations for either the current violence or the discrimination and racism we experience. A very recent example of this is the deletion of Afro-Dominicans from Lin Manuel Miranda's In the Heights , despite the fact that they are the great majority of Latinx people living in Washington Heights. Roberto wakes up every morning to the sight of the big T-shaped scar between his eyes left by the Sheriff's beating, but remains undaunted in the pursuit of his dream of ending erasure, as if the \"T\" stood for \"Truth.\" \"For a time, they made me lose my ability to dream,\" he says. \"But I never lost the ability to remember.\"\n\nAs he recalls the incident, I remember reading about the 538 mostly young, brown kids arrested that weekend.

Current Issue View our current issue \"California,\" Roberto adds \"is literally a killing field everywhere, but nobody outside our community knows it.\" Roberto's journey into the heart of darkness of police killings points to an even larger issue: how the systematic deletion of Latinx people by government databases, the media, philanthropy, Hollywood, and other institutions enables not just police violence but a whole host of other ills. From devastating immigration policies and employment discrimination, to reduced government funding and the colonization of Puerto Rico, these and other afflictions all have an element of removing Latinx people from their own stories. This institutional erasure refers to the ways institutions and society at large suppress or completely silence a group in archives and narratives, as well as in discourse that subtly dehumanizes and sets up Latinx peoples for various forms of oppression. Roberto's talk of California as a \"killing field\" is familiar to me. I recall the silences that preceded the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of Central American peasants ignored before and during and after the war of the 1980s. Since then, I have watched and documented how the nefarious workings of the removal of Salvadorans and other Central Americans from our own stories have extended across 2,500 miles of migration, mass graves, gang and narco violence and other symptoms of unstoried and devalued life. In 2018, I wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review about how most of the national coverage-on-the-ground reports, think pieces, features, op-eds-about the child refugee \"crisis\" in print and electronic media made it seem as though the crisis was \"new,\" as if the mass caging and separation of thousands of child refugees didn't begin in 2014, during the Obama years. Two researchers and I also found that the only representations of the Hondurans, Guatemalans, and Salvadorans who are at the center of this story were two-dimensional images of pain and soundbites of suffering. No Central American scholars, lawyers, nonprofit leaders, or journalists were included in any of the stories from any of the major media. Not one. And the pattern continues, as documented in a recent study by the media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. The effects of this selective official silence are hardly lost on Central Americans like Ana Luna, a Salvadoran refugee who fled gang violence only to be imprisoned with her son in the Karnes Family Detention facility by the Obama administration in 2014. When I asked her about the massive news coverage of Trump's \"border crisis\" in 2018, she responded, \"Only those imprisoned by Trump matter. It's like the thousands of us jailed by Obama never existed.\" Many fear that a similar erasure awaits the Central American refugee children and mothers being imprisoned by Biden. Columbia University scholar Frances Negrón-Muntaner listens to these stories of physical and cultural violence against Latinx peoples and hears the workings of official amnesia. \"Power always has archives,\" she says. \"Police, the state, hospitals, schools, Hollywood, the news media. Any institution that exercises power generates an archive of its founding, its operations. One of the ways Latinos are erased is that the data and stories generated by these institutions are not collected into their archives. The other form of erasure is that the materials may be there but the narratives are not there and are not incorporated into the larger narratives of the country. Latinos have both, and this creates all kinds of profoundly disturbing problems.\" In 2015, Negrón-Muntaner and a team of researchers found that while the Latinx population makes up almost 60 million people-over 17 percent of the United States-they represented only between 2 and 8 percent of the leading actors, directors, showrunners and all other key positions in the television and movie industry. A recent LA Times series on Latinx inclusion in Hollywood found that the situation has actually gotten worse since Muntaner's study. Statistics on employment in the news media show a similar trend: Latinos as the least represented group in the US news industry proportional to their population. (Disclosure: Her report includes a 2009 campaign I led to remove Lou Dobbs from CNN.) It's a fact that Muntaner sees as demanding activism. \"Ending this means confronting white supremacy.\" Though grounded in white supremacy, the practice of erasure is not just a white phenomenon, a fact Roberto knows well. \"As I started sharing the research,\" Roberto Rodriguez tells me, \"some Latinos actually asked me, \"Why you doing that? That's not our issue. Our issue is immigration, not violence.\" He and Muntaner see these responses as forms of colonialism reinforced by the selective memory of physical, psychic, and other violence. Lacking any memory of the history of killing and catastrophe that has shaped different Latinx identities in, say, the colonization of Puerto Rico or the pillaging and state terrorism (see the lynchings and murder of thousands at the hand by Texas Rangers during the Matanza in the Lone Star State) of the parts of the United States that used to be Mexico, different Latinx groups lack any serious explanations for either the current violence or the discrimination and racism we experience. A very recent example of this is the deletion of Afro-Dominicans from Lin Manuel Miranda's In the Heights , despite the fact that they are the great majority of Latinx people living in Washington Heights. Roberto wakes up every morning to the sight of the big T-shaped scar between his eyes left by the Sheriff's beating, but remains undaunted in the pursuit of his dream of ending erasure, as if the \"T\" stood for \"Truth.\" \"For a time, they made me lose my ability to dream,\" he says. \"But I never lost the ability to remember.\"\n\nLast May, Roberto, an associate professor emeritus in the Mexican American Studies Department at the University of Arizona, released the latest iteration of one of his most important dreams: the Raza Database Project (RDP), a project aiming to document the nightmarish, violent effects of Latinx erasure. He and a team of volunteer researchers, journalists, and family members of Latinos killed by police produced a definitive report documenting an undercount of over 2,600 Latinos who have died at the hands of local police officers since 2014, a number that's twice as large as what was previously reported. There, in the cold anonymity of the statistics, he saw the mark of his old foe: erasure. Roberto Cintli Rodriguez was beat by four baton-wielding Los Angeles County Sheriffs in 1979 while reporting about police violence in East LA. \"One day,\" he says, \"I was looking at the 'Unknowns'-people not identified in any racial or ethnic category-and saw all these names I recognized: Lopez, Martinez, Gonzalez, Ramirez.

Latinos have both, and this creates all kinds of profoundly disturbing problems.\" In 2015, Negrón-Muntaner and a team of researchers found that while the Latinx population makes up almost 60 million people-over 17 percent of the United States-they represented only between 2 and 8 percent of the leading actors, directors, showrunners and all other key positions in the television and movie industry. A recent LA Times series on Latinx inclusion in Hollywood found that the situation has actually gotten worse since Muntaner's study. Statistics on employment in the news media show a similar trend: Latinos as the least represented group in the US news industry proportional to their population. (Disclosure: Her report includes a 2009 campaign I led to remove Lou Dobbs from CNN.) It's a fact that Muntaner sees as demanding activism. \"Ending this means confronting white supremacy.\" Though grounded in white supremacy, the practice of erasure is not just a white phenomenon, a fact Roberto knows well. \"As I started sharing the research,\" Roberto Rodriguez tells me, \"some Latinos actually asked me, \"Why you doing that? That's not our issue. Our issue is immigration, not violence.\" He and Muntaner see these responses as forms of colonialism reinforced by the selective memory of physical, psychic, and other violence. Lacking any memory of the history of killing and catastrophe that has shaped different Latinx identities in, say, the colonization of Puerto Rico or the pillaging and state terrorism (see the lynchings and murder of thousands at the hand by Texas Rangers during the Matanza in the Lone Star State) of the parts of the United States that used to be Mexico, different Latinx groups lack any serious explanations for either the current violence or the discrimination and racism we experience. A very recent example of this is the deletion of Afro-Dominicans from Lin Manuel Miranda's In the Heights , despite the fact that they are the great majority of Latinx people living in Washington Heights. Roberto wakes up every morning to the sight of the big T-shaped scar between his eyes left by the Sheriff's beating, but remains undaunted in the pursuit of his dream of ending erasure, as if the \"T\" stood for \"Truth.\" \"For a time, they made me lose my ability to dream,\" he says. \"But I never lost the ability to remember.\"\n\n\"California,\" Roberto adds \"is literally a killing field everywhere, but nobody outside our community knows it.\" Roberto's journey into the heart of darkness of police killings points to an even larger issue: how the systematic deletion of Latinx people by government databases, the media, philanthropy, Hollywood, and other institutions enables not just police violence but a whole host of other ills. From devastating immigration policies and employment discrimination, to reduced government funding and the colonization of Puerto Rico, these and other afflictions all have an element of removing Latinx people from their own stories. This institutional erasure refers to the ways institutions and society at large suppress or completely silence a group in archives and narratives, as well as in discourse that subtly dehumanizes and sets up Latinx peoples for various forms of oppression. Roberto's talk of California as a \"killing field\" is familiar to me. I recall the silences that preceded the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of Central American peasants ignored before and during and after the war of the 1980s. Since then, I have watched and documented how the nefarious workings of the removal of Salvadorans and other Central Americans from our own stories have extended across 2,500 miles of migration, mass graves, gang and narco violence and other symptoms of unstoried and devalued life. In 2018, I wrote for the Columbia Journalism Review about how most of the national coverage-on-the-ground reports, think pieces, features, op-eds-about the child refugee \"crisis\" in print and electronic media made it seem as though the crisis was \"new,\" as if the mass caging and separation of thousands of child refugees didn't begin in 2014, during the Obama years. Two researchers and I also found that the only representations of the Hondurans, Guatemalans, and Salvadorans who are at the center of this story were two-dimensional images of pain and soundbites of suffering. No Central American scholars, lawyers, nonprofit leaders, or journalists were included in any of the stories from any of the major media. Not one. And the pattern continues, as documented in a recent study by the media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. The effects of this selective official silence are hardly lost on Central Americans like Ana Luna, a Salvadoran refugee who fled gang violence only to be imprisoned with her son in the Karnes Family Detention facility by the Obama administration in 2014. When I asked her about the massive news coverage of Trump's \"border crisis\" in 2018, she responded, \"Only those imprisoned by Trump matter. It's like the thousands of us jailed by Obama never existed.\" Many fear that a similar erasure awaits the Central American refugee children and mothers being imprisoned by Biden. Columbia University scholar Frances Negrón-Muntaner listens to these stories of physical and cultural violence against Latinx peoples and hears the workings of official amnesia. \"Power always has archives,\" she says. \"Police, the state, hospitals, schools, Hollywood, the news media. Any institution that exercises power generates an archive of its founding, its operations.

An autopsy said the cause was a meth overdose, and jailers admitted they had strapped Mr. Ames to a restraint chair. While reporting on the case for The Marshall Project , I learned that other facilities had banned restraint chairs, medieval-looking devices that experts say can make it harder to spot a medical crisis.\n\nI visited the jail and it felt like a dungeon, with moldy walls and little sunlight.

Many of the nation's sheriffs have responded with enthusiasm.\n\nThey are thrilled to work with the Trump administration, they said, and to once again \"have a seat at the table\" after four years of what they have described as being ignored by the Biden administration.\n\nBut the sheriffs say they need something in return: money, and lots of it, to cover the cost of what it will take to refocus scant local resources on what is inherently a federal responsibility.\n\n\"The federal government will have to dedicate substantial resources in order to help cover this, and that's no secret. They know that,\" said Jim Skinner, the sheriff in Collin County, Texas.\n\nWhere the money would come from is not yet clear. And the sheriffs' role would be part of a larger federal effort to crack down on immigration violations, all of which will require a significant infusion of new federal funding at a time when there is a commitment to vast cost-cutting across the federal government. Mr. Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, has said mass deportations will cost around $86 billion.\n\nWhile the Trump administration is looking to all state and local law enforcement for help on combating illegal immigration, the country's sheriffs are a logical place to start. As elected officials, they operate with more autonomy than police chiefs, and they control thousands of jails.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "2020 Election Deniers Seek Out Powerful Allies: County Sheriffs\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nConservative activists are working to recruit the law enforcement officers to their cause. Several sheriffs have already clashed with election officials.\n\nBy Alexandra Berzon and Nick Corasaniti\n\nLAS VEGAS - An influential network of conservative activists fixated on the idea that former President Donald J. Trump won the 2020 election is working to recruit county sheriffs to investigate elections based on the false notion that voter fraud is widespread.\n\nThe push, which two right-wing sheriffs' groups have already endorsed, seeks to lend law enforcement credibility to the false claims and has alarmed voting rights advocates. They warn that it could cause chaos in future elections and further weaken trust in an American voting system already battered by attacks from Mr. Trump and his allies.\n\nOne of the conservative sheriffs' groups, Protect America Now, lists about 70 members, and the other, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, does not list its membership but says it conducted trainings on various issues for about 300 of the nation's roughly 3,000 sheriffs in recent years. It is unclear how many sheriffs will ultimately wade into election matters. Many aligned with the groups are from small, rural counties.\n\nBut at least three sheriffs involved in the effort - in Michigan, Kansas and Wisconsin - have already been carrying out their own investigations, clashing with election officials who warn that they are overstepping their authority and meddling in an area where they have little expertise.\n\n\"I'm absolutely sick of it,\" said Pam Palmer, the clerk of Barry County, Mich., where the sheriff has carried out an investigation into the 2020 results for more than a year. \"We didn't do anything wrong, but they've cast a cloud over our entire county that makes people disbelieve in the accuracy of our ability to run an election.\"\n\nIn recent years, sheriffs have usually taken a limited role in investigations of election crimes, which are typically handled by state agencies with input from local election officials. Republican-led state legislatures, at the same time, have pushed to impose harsher criminal penalties for voting infractions , passing 20 such laws in at least 14 states since the 2020 election.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But it was captured on tape and described under oath by four of his deputies.\n\nSuch an explosive revelation might have roiled a community elsewhere in the country and led state or federal officials to investigate. But in Mississippi, it was largely ignored, even after the county paid Mr. Tillman an undisclosed amount to settle his claim.\n\nThere was no news coverage and no state investigation. In an interview, Sheriff Kemp said he had turned the case over to the state's police agency. But the agency could find no record of having pursued it.\n\nThe New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "How Sheriffs Might Power Trump's Deportation Machine\n\nOne of Donald Trump's main campaign promises-one that was printed on signs at the Republican National Convention and at Trump rallies across the country-was mass deportation. In November, Trump announced that Tom Homan, the architect of family separation during his first term, would be his pick to see this promise through, as a \"border czar.\" Homan is enthusiastic about the task ahead of him. \"They ain't seen shit yet,\" he said in July. The effort would look less like \"mass sweeps\" and more like \"targeted arrests,\" he said recently on \"60 Minutes.\" \"We'll know who we're going to arrest, where we're most likely to find 'em based on numerous inve-you know, investigative processes.\"\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nBoth Trump and Homan have indicated that local law enforcement would be involved in carrying out the mass-deportation plan. Ryan Zinke, a Republican representative for Montana, who served as Trump's first Secretary of the Interior, declared , \"The sheriffs know the bad characters.\" And there's an advantage to the county sheriff in particular: nearly all of them are elected officers who are not beholden to other officials, even blue-state governors, many of whom have shown a willingness to work with Trump anyway.\n\nBecause immigration is in the realm of federal law, the role of local law enforcement in policing the border has historically been limited. But, in 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which expanded the criminal charges for which a person could be subject to deportation. As immigration became linked to criminal law, local law enforcement-especially county sheriffs, who enjoy relative autonomy free from direct oversight and have jurisdiction over much larger areas than, say, urban police departments-began to play a critical role in the deportation machine. In counties along the U.S. border, sheriffs receive funding, through a FEMA grant program called Operation Stonegarden, to purchase equipment such as snowmobiles and squad cars for use in conjunction with Border Patrol.\n\nLike all law-enforcement officers, sheriffs have a great deal of discretion in how they conduct traffic stops and arrests, which can bring more people into jail, where some deportations begin. (In county jails, most of which are run by sheriffs, arrestees submit to background checks and can be held or processed for deportation proceedings.) A program called Secure Communities, started by George W. Bush and expanded by the Obama Administration, identifies potentially deportable people in jails. At a national law-enforcement conference, in 2008, a former sheriff in North Carolina said, \"If you don't have enough evidence to charge someone criminally but you think he's illegal, we can make him disappear.\" In 2014, the program was modified slightly, to prioritize the deportation of individuals accused of felonies-the so-called \"felons not families\" guidelines. The following year, the Enforcement and Removal Operations ( ERO ) branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) set several agency records related to arrests and deportations. It was led, at the time, by Tom Homan.\n\nAnother federal program, called 287(g), grants sheriff deputies permission to act as immigration agents themselves, questioning arrestees about their nationality and transferring them to ICE 's custody. During the first Trump Administration, sheriffs clamored to join 287(g), and John F. Kelly, then Secretary of Homeland Security, called the program a \"highly successful force multiplier.\" Many people who were deported had been charged with misdemeanors, even something as simple as a broken taillight. The Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ), which is part of a network of anti-immigration groups linked to the far-right figure John Tanton, recruited sheriffs to join 287(g) as a way to project a tough-on-crime image.\n\nTrump's new Administration is poised to alter existing guidelines so that even more arrestees can enter deportation proceedings. In some states, it is possible that sheriffs will be able to arrest people for simply crossing the border. In 2023, Texas passed Senate Bill 4, which would allow local law enforcement to arrest individuals suspected only of violating immigration law; it is being disputed in the courts. Similar bills passed in Iowa and Oklahoma , where they are also under court challenge, and in November Arizonans voted to implement Ballot Measure 314 , a comparable law. Though the newly elected sheriff of Maricopa County, Jerry Sheridan-the lieutenant to the infamous sheriff Joe Arpaio -has said that he doesn't think the law applies to his office, he has expressed a willingness to detain people in something \"similar\" to Arpaio's Tent City.\n\nBecause most sheriffs are elected, governors or attorneys general have little power over them. They are excluded from the Hatch Act, which bars some government employees from engaging in political activity while on the job, and largely permitted to campaign in uniform. They can make decisions about department policy without seeking approval and with low risk of public opprobrium. They often voice political opinions; before the Presidential election, one Ohio sheriff went so far as to threaten residents who publicly supported Kamala Harris. In a 2021 fund-raising letter, the Claremont Institute-a conservative think tank that the Times has called a \"nerve center of the American right,\" and a part of the advisory board for Project 2025-asserted that sheriffs have \"jurisdictional latitude.\" In the institute's view, this \"places them on the front lines of the defense of civilization.\"\n\nFor that reason, Claremont-alongside other anti-immigration groups, such as FAIR , whose new \"law enforcement advisor\" is Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, a Homan collaborator-has turned its focus to recruiting and training sheriffs to help execute its agenda. In 2021, it created an annual weeklong retreat called the Sheriffs Fellowship, which received funding from Betsy DeVos, \"to study and discuss the political-philosophical, institutional, and historical arc leading from the American Founding to today's militant progressivism and multiculturalism,\" according to a promotional brochure sent to potential applicants.\n\nAt the end of October, just a few days before the 2024 election, a dozen sheriffs fellows gathered in Huntington Beach, California, to discuss pressing topics for the potential Trump Administration, including \"The Three Pillars of Trumpism,\" \"The American Censorship Complex,\" \"How the Deep State Operates,\" and, of course, \"Immigration & National Security.\" They spent five days studying such texts as an essay by the former Hoover Institute scholar Jeremy Carl, who advocates for eliminating temporary-protected-status designations, challenging birthright citizenship, and allowing the military to \"legally fire, where necessary, on anyone invading US territory.\"\n\nThe fellowship culminates with the American Sheriff Award, bestowed upon a Claremont fellow \"to recognize and honor the sheriff 's extraordinary sacrifice in their steadfast defense of the Constitution, its blessings of liberty, and the American way of life.\" This year, the winner was Sheriff Bill Waybourn, of Tarrant County, Texas. (He posed for pictures with a statuette of John Wayne.) Waybourn has faced criticism in his community-which includes Fort Worth-because, since he took office, in 2017, more than sixty people have died while in the custody of the county jail. In 2020, Chastity Congious , a twenty-one-year-old with multiple mental-health disorders and an intellectual disability, gave birth, alone, in a cell of Waybourn's jail, and her baby died. When asked about Waybourn's record of jail fatalities, Ryan Williams, the president of Claremont, responded via e-mail, \"Public officials face difficult choices and tradeoffs, especially those in law enforcement. We hope that the training they receive with Claremont (and, I pray, the guidance of Almighty God) will help them make these decisions in wisdom and justice.\" On November 5th, Waybourn won reëlection.\n\nInviting county sheriffs into the fold moves Claremont closer to real political power. Sheriffs have great influence in rural and suburban communities, where voters are probably more likely to know their sheriff's name than that of their senators or governor. And it's clear that the incoming Trump Administration sees sheriffs as crucial partners in the work ahead. On a recent trip to Arizona, with the talk-show host Dr. Phil, Homan met with a group of sheriffs. There, he emphasized his eagerness to \"help these sheriffs make their communities safer and secure the border once again.\" And he intimated that the work could start before Inauguration Day. \"We're not waiting,\" Homan said. \"Game on, today.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Renegade Sheriffs\n\nOn a Friday afternoon in March, 2013, a sheriff's sergeant named Jody Hoagland noticed a red Nissan pickup truck drifting off a road. Hoagland was two hours into his shift patrolling Liberty County, Florida, eight hundred square miles of the state's Panhandle. He had just come from a small shed fire, and was driving through the Apalachicola National Forest, which carpets the southern half of the county in longleaf pines. Two-lane roads meander past grazing cows, Baptist churches (\"Good News: Jesus Loves You\"), Confederate flags, and roadside stands peddling stink bait. Signs of humankind vanish, save for the solitary roadside mailbox. You live here because you want to be left alone.\n\nHoagland signalled the truck to pull over. A scruffy bearded man was driving and a blond woman was in the passenger seat. A silver .357 revolver lay between them. Two Chihuahuas barked excitedly. Hoagland asked the man, whose name was Floyd Parrish, to get out of the truck, and noticed a bulge in his right jeans pocket-a Titan .25-calibre handgun, it turned out, with one round in the chamber and the safety off. Parrish didn't have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. It was easy to get one-all you had to do was take a class and pay a fee. Hoagland arrested Parrish and drove him to the county jail. Not long afterward, the sheriff, Nick Finch, called.\n\nFinch had been Liberty's sheriff for less than three months. He first decided to run for the job during a garage sale, after a customer locked her keys in her car and Finch called the sheriff's office for help. There was only one deputy on the road, he was told, and the deputy was tied up in a funeral procession. Finch, who was raised on a farm in Iowa, had spent close to two decades in the Army and in the Air Force Reserve, so he was fluent in the language of God and country. White-haired and blue-eyed, with a meaty build, he was appealing to voters, and was helped by the fact that his wife's family had lived in the area for generations.\n\nLiberty County, with eighty-seven hundred residents, is the state's second least populous. It is whiter, poorer, and less well educated than Florida as a whole. Timber has long been the chief industry, though the federal government has slowed logging in recent decades to protect the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. One local told me, \"The saying goes, 'In Liberty County, if you run out of toilet tissue try a woodpecker.' \" A number of side roads bear the names of residents; when I visited recently, I drove down Jimmy Lee Drive and ran into the actual Jimmy Lee. The closest thing to a community history, \"The Heritage of Liberty County, Florida,\" has entries on the region's tupelo honey; homecoming queens; and worm grunting, or coaxing worms out of the earth with a wooden stake and a metal strip. Several pages are devoted to a theory that the Apalachicola River's east bank was the original Garden of Eden.\n\nLiberty's sheriff and his dozen or so deputies are the only law-enforcement agents in the county. As in much of rural America, the sheriff is far more than an administrator. He's an aspirational figure and a moral touchstone. Eddie Joe White, the current sheriff, told me, \"There's no way to define the parameters of sheriff. From one day to the next, you're a fireman, you're a paramedic, you're a grief counsellor. You can't back away from any responsibility and say it's not your job, because, as sheriff, you are responsible for everything as it deals with humanity.\"\n\nFinch won the election on his second try, in 2012, just after his fiftieth birthday. Before taking office, he went online to research his new position. Finch is conservative, and the sites he visited argued that the sheriff, in his county, is more powerful than the President. That argument was consistent with the beliefs of Finch's law-enforcement hero, Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who last year was convicted of defying a court order to stop the racial profiling of Latinos. \"I like Joe, because Joe's a lot like me,\" Finch told me. \"He doesn't take shit from nobody. He knows what his role is, and come hell or high water, he was going to do what he thought was right.\" On Facebook, Finch posted a Breitbart story, about a sheriff named Denny Peyman, headlined \" Kentucky Sheriff to Obama: No Gun Control in My County. \"\n\nThere are roughly three thousand sheriffs in America, in forty-seven states. Arpaio and Peyman are among the dozens aligned with the \"constitutional sheriffs\" movement. Another is David A. Clarke, Jr., the cowboy-hatted Wisconsin firebrand who considered joining the Department of Homeland Security. (He now works at America First Action, a pro-Trump political-action committee.) There are even more followers of constitutional policing across America among law enforcement's rank and file. One group, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or C.S.P.O.A., claims about five thousand members.\n\nC.S.P.O.A. members believe that the sheriff has the final say on a law's constitutionality in his county. Every law-enforcement officer has some leeway in choosing which laws to enforce, which is why it's rare to get a ticket for jaywalking, for example. But, under this philosophy, the supremacy clause of the Constitution, which dictates that federal law takes precedence over state law, is irrelevant. So is the Supreme Court. \"They get up every morning and put their clothes on the same way you and I do,\" Finch told me. \"Why do those nine people get to decide what the rest of the country's going to be like?\" To the most dogmatic, there's only one way to interpret the country's founding documents: pro-gun, anti-immigrant, anti-regulation, anti-Washington.\n\nFinch was on the way to Dirty Dick's Crab House with his wife when he started getting calls about the arrest. (If you are a rural sheriff, everyone has your cell-phone number.) After speaking with Hoagland, he drove to the county jail, where Parrish, a former logger, told his version of the arrest. He and his partner, Sherry Chumney, lived in a wooden house on forty acres of land, a half mile down a dirt road, past a barricade of tangled brush and two \"No Trespassing\" signs. Parrish carried the .357 revolver in case he came across an unfriendly panther or bear. He carried his small gun because he had a chronic lung disease; if he felt woozy, he fired it, and Chumney rushed over with his inhaler. That afternoon, Parrish said, he had driven to his brother's place and forgotten that the small gun was in his pocket.\n\nFinch listened to the story, and then told him, \"Fortunately for you, young man, I'm a believer in the Second Amendment.\" He let Parrish go, a practice that people in Liberty call getting \"unarrested.\"\n\nSince its inception, in ninth-century England-when the sheriff was called the shire reeve, or county guardian-the office has been a kind of one-man government. The first sheriffs were appointed by the king, and charged with collecting taxes, investigating deaths, and commanding the posse comitatus, a gang of locals dispatched to hunt fugitives. (In Latin, the term means \"the force of the county.\") The British brought the idea with them to America, where the office took on the characteristics of its new home. In 1652, when Virginia's royal governor told each county to choose a sheriff, Northampton County let its voters decide.\n\nNearly every American county still has an elected sheriff. Over time, cities established police forces, which diminished the office's power in the densely populated Northeast. (In 2000, Connecticut eliminated the post entirely.) But in the South and in the West, where many counties are far larger than in Eastern states, the sheriff ties together isolated communities. He is Andy Taylor, from \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" and Little Bill Daggett, from \" Unforgiven .\" Southerners call him the \"high sheriff.\" Almost every American sheriff is a white man. He's more likely to come from the place he serves than a police chief is, and his deputies are intimately involved in everyday life. Casey LaFrance, an associate professor at Western Illinois University who studies law enforcement, told me, \"The sheriff's the one that's going to tell me I'm getting divorced if I don't know it, or tell me I have eight days to leave my house.\"\n\nIn most states, including Florida, the sheriff's office is written into the state constitution. Once a sheriff is elected, he can usually be removed only by a governor or by the voters. His average tenure is twenty-four years. \"Once you become the sheriff, you're likely to remain the sheriff until you retire or die,\" LaFrance said. This gives sheriffs wide latitude to shape how the law is enforced. According to research by the political scientists Mirya Holman and Emily Farris, sheriffs who believe myths about abused women-for instance, that they can easily leave their abusers-are less likely to demand the mandatory arrest of domestic-violence suspects. Similarly, sheriffs critical of immigrants are more likely to order deputies to check a driver's immigration status during a routine traffic stop. Holman, an associate professor at Tulane University, said that many sheriffs believe, \"I'm this independent man that has control over this, and no one can tell me what to do.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThe idea of a constitutional sheriff emerged in the nineteen-seventies, in California. It was first proposed by William Potter Gale, who had been an aide to General Douglas MacArthur. According to Daniel Levitas's book, \" The Terrorist Next Door ,\" Gale embraced a belief system called Christian Identity, and, as a self-styled minister, preached that the Constitution was a divinely inspired document intended to elevate whites above Jews and racial minorities. From his Ministry of Christ Church, outside Yosemite National Park, where he sermonized in front of a giant Confederate flag, Gale produced a newsletter, \" IDENTITY ,\" its name reflecting his ideology and his fondness for unnecessary capitalization. In 1971, he mailed Vol. 6, No. 1, to his flock. Its featured story, written by Gale, appeared under the byline of Colonel Ben Cameron, a character in the film \" The Birth of a Nation \" who helps found the Ku Klux Klan. Gale railed against civil-rights laws, the income tax, the United Nations, and the showering of tax dollars on foreign allies. He believed that a conservative posse comitatus offered a solution:\n\nIn the formation of this Constitutional Republic, the COUNTY was-and remains the seat of power for the People. The county Sheriff is the ONLY LEGAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ! The Sheriff can mobilize all men between the ages of 18 and 45 who are in good health and not in the Federal military service. Others can VOLUNTEER , women included. This body of citizens is the SHERIFF'S POSSE . All of them serve when called by the Sheriff. The title of this body is POSSE COMITATUS .\n\nGale was writing not long after Bull Connor, the public-safety commissioner in Birmingham, Alabama, had turned dogs and fire hoses on nonviolent protesters. His innovation was to wrap his rants in constitutionalism and legalese, a tactic intended to make them sound legitimate. Michael Barkun, who has written extensively about the radical right, told me that Gale's message was, \"We know what the law really means. It's all those lawyers who have erected a kind of apparatus of deception.\"\n\nBy the early nineteen-eighties, Gale's dogma, in the form of the Posse Comitatus movement, had taken hold in the Midwestern farm belt, which was reeling from a foreclosure crisis. A sympathizer who ran Cattle Country Broadcasting, in Dodge City, Kansas, played Gale's screeds nightly. \"The law is that your citizens-a posse-will hang an official who violated the law and the Constitution,\" Gale said in the summer of 1982. \"Take him to the most populated intersection of the township and at noon hang him by the neck.\" Posses had formed in nearly half the country. Some convened their own \"common law\" grand juries and \"indicted\" officials for ostensibly failing to uphold their oaths of office. A few turned violent. Posse members assaulted an I.R.S. agent in Wisconsin, tried to \"arrest\" a cop in Idaho, and nearly provoked a shoot-out in a California tomato field.\n\nThe movement's violent side was eventually its downfall. In 1983, authorities in North Dakota tried to arrest a Posse acolyte named Gordon Kahl, a mechanic who had violated probation in a tax-evasion case, and two U.S. marshals died in the ensuing standoff. Kahl went into hiding for four months, and then was killed in a second gun battle, in Arkansas, along with a local sheriff. Although some Posse members rebranded themselves Christian Patriots, it was too late. A few years later, Gale was convicted of mailing death threats to a judge and to I.R.S. agents. When he died, in 1988, the movement was fading from prominence. His vision of sheriff supremacy, however, persisted.\n\nAfter Sheriff Finch released Floyd Parrish, Sergeant Hoagland couldn't let the incident go. \"The more I just sat there and stewed on it, steamed on it, it just ate away at me,\" Hoagland told me. He had no problem with guns; he hunted gators, deer, turkeys, and squirrels. But he suspected that Finch was doing a political favor. Hoagland wasn't the only deputy suspicious of Finch. The sheriff's experience was mostly in the military and in state agencies, not in small-town policing. When I met Mark Mallory, a former lieutenant at the office, he handed me paperwork from four incidents that he believed Finch had mishandled. Other former deputies recalled a botched attempted arrest in which Finch told the man detained, \"I'm fucking God in this county.\" (Finch told me that he didn't remember the incident, and added, \"I'm a Christian, and I would never compare myself to God.\")\n\nHoagland started looking for another job, and two months after the Parrish incident a nearby fire department offered him full-time work. On his last day at the sheriff's office, Hoagland called an inspector at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, a state agency that investigates misconduct by public officials. Three days later, he travelled to F.D.L.E. headquarters, in Tallahassee, for a taped interview. He told inspectors that he had kept a copy of the paperwork from Parrish's arrest but that when Tim Partridge, another deputy, went to retrieve the jail copy it was missing. Partridge also checked the logbook for Parrish's name, and found that someone had whited it out.\n\nEleven days later, a friend tipped Finch off that his arrest was imminent. Finch, who was at the sheriff's office, went home and changed into a blue shirt and jeans so that reporters couldn't take an arrest photo of him in uniform. When he got back to the office, F.D.L.E. officials were waiting for him. An inspector read him Executive Order 13-140, in which Rick Scott, the Republican governor, suspended him from office. \"I thought, This is crazy. I haven't done anything wrong,\" Finch told me. The headline in the Calhoun-Liberty Journal read \"Sheriff Arrested for Official Misconduct.\" In the next issue, the paper listed him in the police blotter alongside men arrested on suspicion of domestic battery and armed robbery.\n\nShortly after the arrest, Finch got a phone call from Richard Mack, who had followed news of the arrest from his Arizona home. Mack said that he was the founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. In Finch, he saw a fellow-patriot, and he wanted to help.\n\nOne day last fall, Mack bounded to the front of a school lecture hall in suburban Phoenix. At sixty-four, he has dark hair and a grandfatherly charm. The night before, I'd met him at a mall where, for exercise, he likes to ascend the descending escalators. This morning, he was proselytizing to about three dozen people at his group's Oath of Office Training, one of several workshops that it puts on across the country each year.\n\nThe workshop was held in a white room draped with six American flags and a canary-yellow Gadsden flag, reading \" DON'T TREAD ON ME, \" which was a mainstay of Trump and Tea Party rallies. \"We have a moral responsibility to obey just laws, and we have a moral responsibility not to obey unjust laws,\" Mack told the audience of mostly older white men, echoing Martin Luther King, Jr. \"Who decides? The person who takes the oath decides.\" There were murmurs of approval.\n\nThe crowd was a cross-section of today's anti-government right: a retired male cop fed up with \"Antifa nonsense,\" a retired female cop concerned about \"the jihadi threat,\" an elderly couple afraid of \"the conspiracy to put us into world governance.\" Another man told me that the world is controlled by the Vatican, the District of Columbia, and the Queen of England, then handed me seven stapled pieces of paper and promised, \"It's gonna make your eyes fall out of your head.\" It was an indictment issued by a common-law grand jury, one of William Potter Gale's innovations.\n\nIn the eighties and nineties, Mack served two terms as the sheriff of Graham County, Arizona. One of his influences was the Salt Lake City police chief and author W. Cleon Skousen, who believed that the Founders were God's disciples and the Constitution a Christian document. As a young officer, Mack had attended one of Skousen's workshops. \"That man spoke with the power of angels,\" he told me.\n\nIn 1994, Mack and a Montana sheriff named Jay Printz sued the federal government over a provision of the Brady Bill, a gun-control measure that would have temporarily required sheriffs to run background checks on gun buyers. As the case worked its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Mack became a hero of the burgeoning militia movement, a collection of anti-government paramilitary groups that descended from Posse ideology. His status was bolstered after the Court ruled in the sheriffs' favor, in Printz v. United States, in 1997. Each person at the Arizona workshop received a booklet dissecting the case, which, on the cover, had been renamed \"Mack/Printz v. USA.\"\n\nAs the decade wore on, the militia movement lost momentum, and Mack's speaking gigs dried up. He worked as the public-relations director of Gun Owners of America, the N.R.A.'s more strident cousin. He also sold cars, ran for the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian, and was a contestant on the sole season of the Showtime reality series \"American Candidate.\" Disgruntlement with the Presidency of Barack Obama, and the dismal economy of the late aughts, helped revive anti-government fervor, and, along with it, Mack's influence. In 2009, he self-published \" The County Sheriff: America's Last Hope ,\" a fifty-page manifesto with a sheriff's star on the front and an endorsement from Arpaio on the back. \"There is a man who can stop the abuse, end the tyranny, and restore the Constitution, once again, as the supreme law of the land,\" he writes. \"Yes, it is you SHERIFF !\" Mack said that he sold a hundred thousand copies of the book.\n\nBy this time, sheriff supremacy had cross-pollinated with other kinds of right-wing thought, resulting, for example, in the county-supremacy movement, in which dozens of counties adopted ordinances claiming control over federal land. Each repackaging of the idea helped to slightly shift the broader public's perception of what constitutes normal governance. This is how fringe ideas work. In a recent study published in the journal Political Behavior , participants were given a list of ways to address a divisive policy issue, such as immigration. Participants whose lists included either radically conservative positions (ban immigrants entirely) or radically liberal positions (accept all immigrants) were more likely to recalibrate their view of what the centrist stance was. Matthew N. Lyons, the author of the upcoming book \" Insurgent Supremacists ,\" told me that this is how the extreme right wields power without holding office. \"Their notion of political change is based on shifting the parameters of the political culture as a precondition for transforming institutions,\" he said.\n\nWhen Mack launched the C.S.P.O.A., around 2010, he described it as \"the army to set our nation free.\" He recruited supporters, in part, by playing to sheriffs' Second Amendment ardor. (In Holman and Farris's survey of sheriffs, ninety-five per cent said that defending gun rights was more important than restricting access to firearms.) After the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, and the subsequent push in Washington for gun control, Mack published a list that eventually included almost five hundred sheriffs who, in his words, \"have vowed to uphold and defend the Constitution against Obama's unconstitutional gun control measures.\" (Several sheriffs later said that Mack had added them without their knowledge.) One Tennessee sheriff told the Southern Poverty Law Center, \"If you come in here trying to take up the guns, it's not going to be a nice day for somebody.\"\n\nMack told me that he has spoken at more than a hundred and twenty-five rallies. Many supporters were also Skousenites, because the conservative commentator Glenn Beck routinely touted Skousen's books. At C.S.P.O.A. workshops, everyone gets a Mad Libs-style workbook based on Skousen's \" The Making of America .\" Speakers emphasize the Second Amendment, the Fourth (searches and seizures), and the Tenth (states' rights). They portray officers as arbiters of morality and justice.\n\nMack personally disavows discrimination and infuses his lectures with the language of the civil-rights era. He likes to say, \"We should have never heard of Rosa Parks,\" explaining that a constitutional sheriff wouldn't have arrested her. Yet, according to his ideology, a sheriff could, for example, reject the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted citizenship and rights to former slaves. (Mack described such a scenario as a \"hypothetical,\" and said, \"I don't do hypotheticals. I deal with what's real.\") A speaker at one C.S.P.O.A. event I attended, an attorney, encouraged us to memorize the chorus of a song he'd written:\n\nNo matter what they told you all Courts and judges cannot make law The case law method has a fatal flaw Because courts cannot make law.\n\nMack brought Finch's case to the attention of the conservative media. Within days of Finch's arrest, the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was floating the notion on his Web site, Infowars, that the case was an example of political persecution. An Infowars contributor said that Finch had won office as a nonpartisan candidate, \"which to me is probably why you had a Republican governor sic his minions on this constitutional-following sheriff, because he owes his allegiance to no one.\" Soon Mack called into the Infowars talk show and raised the possibility that Finch's suspension was the result of an attempted coup. \"That's very common, to have enemies within,\" he said.\n\nAmid the flurry of coverage, a radio host named Burnie Thompson invited Finch on his afternoon show, on Talk Radio 101. Thompson prided himself on his independent thinking. \"I'm not one of these-what do they call them?-whatever, these fringe groups,\" Thompson told me. \"I'm a pretty mainstream guy. I'm an Air Force captain. I got a master's in journalism.\" Still, he was impressed by Finch's certainty that he'd done nothing wrong. After the interview, he read Mack's book about constitutional sheriffs and became a convert. During the next few months, he interviewed Finch around a dozen times, helped him raise money for his defense, and asked a listener to record a song about the case to the tune of Bob Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff,\" replacing \"shot\" with \"saved.\"\n\nThompson told me that, in a bid to get Finch's case thrown out, he had met with Governor Scott and his general counsel, Peter Antonacci. Thompson shared a theory with them, gleaned in part from Mack's book, that a sheriff can do whatever he wants in his own jail. Antonacci repeatedly told him that there was no legal precedent for this theory. \"I'm thinking, His chief counsel believes that?\" Thompson said. \"You know that feeling when you go, 'Oh, my God, the world's not what I thought it was'?\" (Neither Antonacci nor Scott's office responded to multiple requests for comment.)\n\nIn addition to official misconduct, a third-degree felony, Finch was charged with falsifying public records, a misdemeanor. Jack Campbell, the prosecutor in the case, told me, \"To me, it was always a public-records case. If you want to stop enforcing a law, O.K., I guess you can. You can fire all your deputies and just sit over there in your office all day, if that's what you want to do.\" He continued, \"But you're the sheriff: you can't hide and not tell people what you're doing.\"\n\nFinch's trial started just before Halloween. By then, his Facebook page had more likes than there are residents in Liberty County, and his defense fund had raised almost fifteen thousand dollars. \"Somebody even sent me money from Australia,\" Finch told me. There had been three rallies in three towns, the last in front of the Liberty County courthouse. More than a hundred people, some in American-flag shirts or scarves, strung up a Gadsden flag, set out lawn chairs and coolers, and waved signs: \"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty\"; \"Protect our Constitution\"; \"Nick Finch, the people's sheriff.\" One woman had strung a container of Bic Cover-it correction fluid around her neck, a nod to how Floyd Parrish's name had vanished from the jail records.\n\nOn the day Finch testified, the mood in the Liberty courthouse was as electric as the opening night of a play. Mack had flown in from Arizona. Reporters came from Tallahassee. Finch wore a dark jacket, a blue dotted tie, and beige slacks. On his right lapel was a tiny American-flag pin.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"Sheriff Finch,\" Campbell said, \"do you think you're above the law?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you think your judgment trumps everybody else's in the court system?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that you had the authority as a constitutional sheriff to do away with this case, on your own authority?\" Campbell asked.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Finch replied.\n\nThe case against Finch was mostly circumstantial. The jailer who'd been on duty that night testified that the sheriff walked out of the building with Parrish's file. \"Now, whether it's under his bed at the house, or it's out in the woods, or it's in the shredder in a burn pit, it doesn't make a hell of a difference. It's not where it belongs,\" Campbell told the jury. No one admitted to whiting out Parrish's name in the jail records, though investigators had a lab analyze the splotches, which proved that someone had. \"The fact is,\" Campbell argued, \"that the sheriff told this jury that he believes that his discretion allows him to decide which laws he's going to follow and which laws he's not. Ladies and gentlemen, if he's going to break the law concerning carry-and-conceal firearms, how are we to believe that he won't break the one for perjury in this trial?\"\n\nThe jury deliberated for about an hour, and found Finch not guilty on both counts. Finch hugged everyone within reach, made a few remarks to the TV scrum outside the courthouse, and then called Alex Jones, who told his audience, \"He needs to be the next governor-I'm telling you right now-of Florida. It's these type of men that stand up for the Constitution that are going to save this country.\"\n\nFinch, reinstated, sued the county for attorneys' fees and won about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars. The rest of his term was less triumphant. He fought with county commissioners over his budget. Three female employees sued him-two alleging gender discrimination in the department and one that he had sexually harassed her. Finch settled with all three. Trump's emergence as a Presidential front-runner was a rare bright spot for Finch, who said he was among the first sheriffs in Florida to endorse him. Finch got to meet the future President at a rally in Tampa. \"You know what?\" he told me. \"I look at Trump and I see myself. Because this guy is getting the shit beat out of him from Day One.\"\n\nFinch ran for reëlection in 2016. His chief opponent was Eddie Joe White, who was related to three previous Liberty County sheriffs, including one who was shot and killed in the line of duty in 1919. White chose a pointed campaign slogan: \"It's time we restore the trust.\" Finch's ads touted him as \"Your Constitutional Sheriff,\" but he and his wife, the Liberty County native, had divorced, and he knew this would count against him. Late one night about a month and a half before the election, Floyd Parrish and an acquaintance got into an argument. According to Parrish, the man, drunk and threatening, lunged at him, and he had no choice but to shoot. The man died. A deputy called Finch in the middle of the night to relay the news. Finch told me he thought, \"Jesus. I'm done. There's the election.\" He lost the sheriff's race, earning only six per cent of the vote.\n\nFor the constitutional-sheriffs movement, however, Finch's defeat didn't matter. The C.S.P.O.A. named him Sheriff of the Year in 2014, and Mack mentioned the trial in his book \" Are You a David? \" (The government is Goliath.) The movement's ideas have now spread far beyond a few renegade sheriffs. In Nevada, for example, members of the Bundy family have emerged as leaders of a movement to wrest control of public lands from Washington. During an armed standoff on the ranch of the family patriarch, Cliven Bundy, which drew anti-government crowds from around the country, including several constitutional sheriffs, Bundy demanded that his local sheriff disarm federal authorities. The sheriff refused. Earlier this year, after charges against Bundy related to the standoff were dismissed, Bundy said to a TV reporter, \"I think we're going to protest the county sheriff: 'Why didn't you do your job?' \"\n\nIn 2015, a Nevada lawmaker introduced a bill to give sheriffs veto power over some federal law-enforcement activities. Last year, in Washington, D.C., Jason Chaffetz, at that time a U.S. representative from Utah, introduced a bill that would, in practice, transfer law-enforcement responsibilities to sheriffs on certain public lands. Soon after Trump took office, he met with representatives of the National Sheriffs' Association, including a sheriff from Pennsylvania who had served on C.S.P.O.A.'s advisory council, and one from North Carolina who had ties to the group. That summer, Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, who is now running for the U.S. Senate in Arizona. A few years back, when Mack visited D.C. to decry the Obama Administration's immigration measures, only three lawmakers met with him. One was Jeff Sessions, now the Attorney General. Ryan Lenz, a senior investigative reporter at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told me that \"the migration of these ideas to the mainstream primed the election for Trump.\" Trump's election, in turn, \"finalized the migration.\"\n\nI met Finch one night in December at a McDonald's in Blountstown, Florida. We sat at a table near the window, the restaurant wreathed for the holiday. Finch was working as a long-haul trucker and had just finished a trip to South Carolina. He wore a Harley-Davidson T-shirt and a \"Thin Blue Line\" baseball cap; its insignia, an American flag with a single blue stripe, honors police. He recounted his time as sheriff, and when he got to the trial he stopped and shook his head. Occasionally, he strayed into national politics, asking, \"How in the hell does Hillary Clinton get to lie, cheat, steal, and probably kill, and nobody cares?\" As we talked, a former deputy stopped at our table and said, \"What's going on, Sheriff?\" Finch responded with a pained smile.\n\nFinch remains a powerful symbol for constitutional sheriffs. The day after Trump's Inauguration, under a gray, drizzling sky, I drove to an Embassy Suites near the Baltimore airport for a C.S.P.O.A. training workshop. While I waited at a table in the lobby for my packet-and my black-and-gold lanyard that said I was part of the \"posse\"-a group of pink pussy-hatted women passed by, on their way to the Women's March in Washington. In a conference room, the C.S.P.O.A. audience flipped through their \"Making of America\" booklets. Mack wasn't there, but, via a video monitor, he introduced Finch as a sheriff whose \"strong stand for freedom\" had cost him his badge. Finch stood up, put his hand over his heart, and led the room in the Pledge of Allegiance. ♦\n\nReporting for this piece was supported by a grant from the Reporting Award at N.Y.U.'s Arthur L.

      "text": "The Renegade Sheriffs\n\nOn a Friday afternoon in March, 2013, a sheriff's sergeant named Jody Hoagland noticed a red Nissan pickup truck drifting off a road. Hoagland was two hours into his shift patrolling Liberty County, Florida, eight hundred square miles of the state's Panhandle. He had just come from a small shed fire, and was driving through the Apalachicola National Forest, which carpets the southern half of the county in longleaf pines. Two-lane roads meander past grazing cows, Baptist churches (\"Good News: Jesus Loves You\"), Confederate flags, and roadside stands peddling stink bait. Signs of humankind vanish, save for the solitary roadside mailbox. You live here because you want to be left alone.\n\nHoagland signalled the truck to pull over. A scruffy bearded man was driving and a blond woman was in the passenger seat. A silver .357 revolver lay between them. Two Chihuahuas barked excitedly. Hoagland asked the man, whose name was Floyd Parrish, to get out of the truck, and noticed a bulge in his right jeans pocket-a Titan .25-calibre handgun, it turned out, with one round in the chamber and the safety off. Parrish didn't have a permit to carry a concealed weapon. It was easy to get one-all you had to do was take a class and pay a fee. Hoagland arrested Parrish and drove him to the county jail. Not long afterward, the sheriff, Nick Finch, called.\n\nFinch had been Liberty's sheriff for less than three months. He first decided to run for the job during a garage sale, after a customer locked her keys in her car and Finch called the sheriff's office for help. There was only one deputy on the road, he was told, and the deputy was tied up in a funeral procession. Finch, who was raised on a farm in Iowa, had spent close to two decades in the Army and in the Air Force Reserve, so he was fluent in the language of God and country. White-haired and blue-eyed, with a meaty build, he was appealing to voters, and was helped by the fact that his wife's family had lived in the area for generations.\n\nLiberty County, with eighty-seven hundred residents, is the state's second least populous. It is whiter, poorer, and less well educated than Florida as a whole. Timber has long been the chief industry, though the federal government has slowed logging in recent decades to protect the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. One local told me, \"The saying goes, 'In Liberty County, if you run out of toilet tissue try a woodpecker.' \" A number of side roads bear the names of residents; when I visited recently, I drove down Jimmy Lee Drive and ran into the actual Jimmy Lee. The closest thing to a community history, \"The Heritage of Liberty County, Florida,\" has entries on the region's tupelo honey; homecoming queens; and worm grunting, or coaxing worms out of the earth with a wooden stake and a metal strip. Several pages are devoted to a theory that the Apalachicola River's east bank was the original Garden of Eden.\n\nLiberty's sheriff and his dozen or so deputies are the only law-enforcement agents in the county. As in much of rural America, the sheriff is far more than an administrator. He's an aspirational figure and a moral touchstone. Eddie Joe White, the current sheriff, told me, \"There's no way to define the parameters of sheriff. From one day to the next, you're a fireman, you're a paramedic, you're a grief counsellor. You can't back away from any responsibility and say it's not your job, because, as sheriff, you are responsible for everything as it deals with humanity.\"\n\nFinch won the election on his second try, in 2012, just after his fiftieth birthday. Before taking office, he went online to research his new position. Finch is conservative, and the sites he visited argued that the sheriff, in his county, is more powerful than the President. That argument was consistent with the beliefs of Finch's law-enforcement hero, Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who last year was convicted of defying a court order to stop the racial profiling of Latinos. \"I like Joe, because Joe's a lot like me,\" Finch told me. \"He doesn't take shit from nobody. He knows what his role is, and come hell or high water, he was going to do what he thought was right.\" On Facebook, Finch posted a Breitbart story, about a sheriff named Denny Peyman, headlined \" Kentucky Sheriff to Obama: No Gun Control in My County. \"\n\nThere are roughly three thousand sheriffs in America, in forty-seven states. Arpaio and Peyman are among the dozens aligned with the \"constitutional sheriffs\" movement. Another is David A. Clarke, Jr., the cowboy-hatted Wisconsin firebrand who considered joining the Department of Homeland Security. (He now works at America First Action, a pro-Trump political-action committee.) There are even more followers of constitutional policing across America among law enforcement's rank and file. One group, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, or C.S.P.O.A., claims about five thousand members.\n\nC.S.P.O.A. members believe that the sheriff has the final say on a law's constitutionality in his county. Every law-enforcement officer has some leeway in choosing which laws to enforce, which is why it's rare to get a ticket for jaywalking, for example. But, under this philosophy, the supremacy clause of the Constitution, which dictates that federal law takes precedence over state law, is irrelevant. So is the Supreme Court. \"They get up every morning and put their clothes on the same way you and I do,\" Finch told me. \"Why do those nine people get to decide what the rest of the country's going to be like?\" To the most dogmatic, there's only one way to interpret the country's founding documents: pro-gun, anti-immigrant, anti-regulation, anti-Washington.\n\nFinch was on the way to Dirty Dick's Crab House with his wife when he started getting calls about the arrest. (If you are a rural sheriff, everyone has your cell-phone number.) After speaking with Hoagland, he drove to the county jail, where Parrish, a former logger, told his version of the arrest. He and his partner, Sherry Chumney, lived in a wooden house on forty acres of land, a half mile down a dirt road, past a barricade of tangled brush and two \"No Trespassing\" signs. Parrish carried the .357 revolver in case he came across an unfriendly panther or bear. He carried his small gun because he had a chronic lung disease; if he felt woozy, he fired it, and Chumney rushed over with his inhaler. That afternoon, Parrish said, he had driven to his brother's place and forgotten that the small gun was in his pocket.\n\nFinch listened to the story, and then told him, \"Fortunately for you, young man, I'm a believer in the Second Amendment.\" He let Parrish go, a practice that people in Liberty call getting \"unarrested.\"\n\nSince its inception, in ninth-century England-when the sheriff was called the shire reeve, or county guardian-the office has been a kind of one-man government. The first sheriffs were appointed by the king, and charged with collecting taxes, investigating deaths, and commanding the posse comitatus, a gang of locals dispatched to hunt fugitives. (In Latin, the term means \"the force of the county.\") The British brought the idea with them to America, where the office took on the characteristics of its new home. In 1652, when Virginia's royal governor told each county to choose a sheriff, Northampton County let its voters decide.\n\nNearly every American county still has an elected sheriff. Over time, cities established police forces, which diminished the office's power in the densely populated Northeast. (In 2000, Connecticut eliminated the post entirely.) But in the South and in the West, where many counties are far larger than in Eastern states, the sheriff ties together isolated communities. He is Andy Taylor, from \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" and Little Bill Daggett, from \" Unforgiven .\" Southerners call him the \"high sheriff.\" Almost every American sheriff is a white man. He's more likely to come from the place he serves than a police chief is, and his deputies are intimately involved in everyday life. Casey LaFrance, an associate professor at Western Illinois University who studies law enforcement, told me, \"The sheriff's the one that's going to tell me I'm getting divorced if I don't know it, or tell me I have eight days to leave my house.\"\n\nIn most states, including Florida, the sheriff's office is written into the state constitution. Once a sheriff is elected, he can usually be removed only by a governor or by the voters. His average tenure is twenty-four years. \"Once you become the sheriff, you're likely to remain the sheriff until you retire or die,\" LaFrance said. This gives sheriffs wide latitude to shape how the law is enforced. According to research by the political scientists Mirya Holman and Emily Farris, sheriffs who believe myths about abused women-for instance, that they can easily leave their abusers-are less likely to demand the mandatory arrest of domestic-violence suspects. Similarly, sheriffs critical of immigrants are more likely to order deputies to check a driver's immigration status during a routine traffic stop. Holman, an associate professor at Tulane University, said that many sheriffs believe, \"I'm this independent man that has control over this, and no one can tell me what to do.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThe idea of a constitutional sheriff emerged in the nineteen-seventies, in California. It was first proposed by William Potter Gale, who had been an aide to General Douglas MacArthur. According to Daniel Levitas's book, \" The Terrorist Next Door ,\" Gale embraced a belief system called Christian Identity, and, as a self-styled minister, preached that the Constitution was a divinely inspired document intended to elevate whites above Jews and racial minorities. From his Ministry of Christ Church, outside Yosemite National Park, where he sermonized in front of a giant Confederate flag, Gale produced a newsletter, \" IDENTITY ,\" its name reflecting his ideology and his fondness for unnecessary capitalization. In 1971, he mailed Vol. 6, No. 1, to his flock. Its featured story, written by Gale, appeared under the byline of Colonel Ben Cameron, a character in the film \" The Birth of a Nation \" who helps found the Ku Klux Klan. Gale railed against civil-rights laws, the income tax, the United Nations, and the showering of tax dollars on foreign allies. He believed that a conservative posse comitatus offered a solution:\n\nIn the formation of this Constitutional Republic, the COUNTY was-and remains the seat of power for the People. The county Sheriff is the ONLY LEGAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ! The Sheriff can mobilize all men between the ages of 18 and 45 who are in good health and not in the Federal military service. Others can VOLUNTEER , women included. This body of citizens is the SHERIFF'S POSSE . All of them serve when called by the Sheriff. The title of this body is POSSE COMITATUS .\n\nGale was writing not long after Bull Connor, the public-safety commissioner in Birmingham, Alabama, had turned dogs and fire hoses on nonviolent protesters. His innovation was to wrap his rants in constitutionalism and legalese, a tactic intended to make them sound legitimate. Michael Barkun, who has written extensively about the radical right, told me that Gale's message was, \"We know what the law really means. It's all those lawyers who have erected a kind of apparatus of deception.\"\n\nBy the early nineteen-eighties, Gale's dogma, in the form of the Posse Comitatus movement, had taken hold in the Midwestern farm belt, which was reeling from a foreclosure crisis. A sympathizer who ran Cattle Country Broadcasting, in Dodge City, Kansas, played Gale's screeds nightly. \"The law is that your citizens-a posse-will hang an official who violated the law and the Constitution,\" Gale said in the summer of 1982. \"Take him to the most populated intersection of the township and at noon hang him by the neck.\" Posses had formed in nearly half the country. Some convened their own \"common law\" grand juries and \"indicted\" officials for ostensibly failing to uphold their oaths of office. A few turned violent. Posse members assaulted an I.R.S. agent in Wisconsin, tried to \"arrest\" a cop in Idaho, and nearly provoked a shoot-out in a California tomato field.\n\nThe movement's violent side was eventually its downfall. In 1983, authorities in North Dakota tried to arrest a Posse acolyte named Gordon Kahl, a mechanic who had violated probation in a tax-evasion case, and two U.S. marshals died in the ensuing standoff. Kahl went into hiding for four months, and then was killed in a second gun battle, in Arkansas, along with a local sheriff. Although some Posse members rebranded themselves Christian Patriots, it was too late. A few years later, Gale was convicted of mailing death threats to a judge and to I.R.S. agents. When he died, in 1988, the movement was fading from prominence. His vision of sheriff supremacy, however, persisted.\n\nAfter Sheriff Finch released Floyd Parrish, Sergeant Hoagland couldn't let the incident go. \"The more I just sat there and stewed on it, steamed on it, it just ate away at me,\" Hoagland told me. He had no problem with guns; he hunted gators, deer, turkeys, and squirrels. But he suspected that Finch was doing a political favor. Hoagland wasn't the only deputy suspicious of Finch. The sheriff's experience was mostly in the military and in state agencies, not in small-town policing. When I met Mark Mallory, a former lieutenant at the office, he handed me paperwork from four incidents that he believed Finch had mishandled. Other former deputies recalled a botched attempted arrest in which Finch told the man detained, \"I'm fucking God in this county.\" (Finch told me that he didn't remember the incident, and added, \"I'm a Christian, and I would never compare myself to God.\")\n\nHoagland started looking for another job, and two months after the Parrish incident a nearby fire department offered him full-time work. On his last day at the sheriff's office, Hoagland called an inspector at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, a state agency that investigates misconduct by public officials. Three days later, he travelled to F.D.L.E. headquarters, in Tallahassee, for a taped interview. He told inspectors that he had kept a copy of the paperwork from Parrish's arrest but that when Tim Partridge, another deputy, went to retrieve the jail copy it was missing. Partridge also checked the logbook for Parrish's name, and found that someone had whited it out.\n\nEleven days later, a friend tipped Finch off that his arrest was imminent. Finch, who was at the sheriff's office, went home and changed into a blue shirt and jeans so that reporters couldn't take an arrest photo of him in uniform. When he got back to the office, F.D.L.E. officials were waiting for him. An inspector read him Executive Order 13-140, in which Rick Scott, the Republican governor, suspended him from office. \"I thought, This is crazy. I haven't done anything wrong,\" Finch told me. The headline in the Calhoun-Liberty Journal read \"Sheriff Arrested for Official Misconduct.\" In the next issue, the paper listed him in the police blotter alongside men arrested on suspicion of domestic battery and armed robbery.\n\nShortly after the arrest, Finch got a phone call from Richard Mack, who had followed news of the arrest from his Arizona home. Mack said that he was the founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. In Finch, he saw a fellow-patriot, and he wanted to help.\n\nOne day last fall, Mack bounded to the front of a school lecture hall in suburban Phoenix. At sixty-four, he has dark hair and a grandfatherly charm. The night before, I'd met him at a mall where, for exercise, he likes to ascend the descending escalators. This morning, he was proselytizing to about three dozen people at his group's Oath of Office Training, one of several workshops that it puts on across the country each year.\n\nThe workshop was held in a white room draped with six American flags and a canary-yellow Gadsden flag, reading \" DON'T TREAD ON ME, \" which was a mainstay of Trump and Tea Party rallies. \"We have a moral responsibility to obey just laws, and we have a moral responsibility not to obey unjust laws,\" Mack told the audience of mostly older white men, echoing Martin Luther King, Jr. \"Who decides? The person who takes the oath decides.\" There were murmurs of approval.\n\nThe crowd was a cross-section of today's anti-government right: a retired male cop fed up with \"Antifa nonsense,\" a retired female cop concerned about \"the jihadi threat,\" an elderly couple afraid of \"the conspiracy to put us into world governance.\" Another man told me that the world is controlled by the Vatican, the District of Columbia, and the Queen of England, then handed me seven stapled pieces of paper and promised, \"It's gonna make your eyes fall out of your head.\" It was an indictment issued by a common-law grand jury, one of William Potter Gale's innovations.\n\nIn the eighties and nineties, Mack served two terms as the sheriff of Graham County, Arizona. One of his influences was the Salt Lake City police chief and author W. Cleon Skousen, who believed that the Founders were God's disciples and the Constitution a Christian document. As a young officer, Mack had attended one of Skousen's workshops. \"That man spoke with the power of angels,\" he told me.\n\nIn 1994, Mack and a Montana sheriff named Jay Printz sued the federal government over a provision of the Brady Bill, a gun-control measure that would have temporarily required sheriffs to run background checks on gun buyers. As the case worked its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Mack became a hero of the burgeoning militia movement, a collection of anti-government paramilitary groups that descended from Posse ideology. His status was bolstered after the Court ruled in the sheriffs' favor, in Printz v. United States, in 1997. Each person at the Arizona workshop received a booklet dissecting the case, which, on the cover, had been renamed \"Mack/Printz v. USA.\"\n\nAs the decade wore on, the militia movement lost momentum, and Mack's speaking gigs dried up. He worked as the public-relations director of Gun Owners of America, the N.R.A.'s more strident cousin. He also sold cars, ran for the U.S. Senate as a Libertarian, and was a contestant on the sole season of the Showtime reality series \"American Candidate.\" Disgruntlement with the Presidency of Barack Obama, and the dismal economy of the late aughts, helped revive anti-government fervor, and, along with it, Mack's influence. In 2009, he self-published \" The County Sheriff: America's Last Hope ,\" a fifty-page manifesto with a sheriff's star on the front and an endorsement from Arpaio on the back. \"There is a man who can stop the abuse, end the tyranny, and restore the Constitution, once again, as the supreme law of the land,\" he writes. \"Yes, it is you SHERIFF !\" Mack said that he sold a hundred thousand copies of the book.\n\nBy this time, sheriff supremacy had cross-pollinated with other kinds of right-wing thought, resulting, for example, in the county-supremacy movement, in which dozens of counties adopted ordinances claiming control over federal land. Each repackaging of the idea helped to slightly shift the broader public's perception of what constitutes normal governance. This is how fringe ideas work. In a recent study published in the journal Political Behavior , participants were given a list of ways to address a divisive policy issue, such as immigration. Participants whose lists included either radically conservative positions (ban immigrants entirely) or radically liberal positions (accept all immigrants) were more likely to recalibrate their view of what the centrist stance was. Matthew N. Lyons, the author of the upcoming book \" Insurgent Supremacists ,\" told me that this is how the extreme right wields power without holding office. \"Their notion of political change is based on shifting the parameters of the political culture as a precondition for transforming institutions,\" he said.\n\nWhen Mack launched the C.S.P.O.A., around 2010, he described it as \"the army to set our nation free.\" He recruited supporters, in part, by playing to sheriffs' Second Amendment ardor. (In Holman and Farris's survey of sheriffs, ninety-five per cent said that defending gun rights was more important than restricting access to firearms.) After the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, and the subsequent push in Washington for gun control, Mack published a list that eventually included almost five hundred sheriffs who, in his words, \"have vowed to uphold and defend the Constitution against Obama's unconstitutional gun control measures.\" (Several sheriffs later said that Mack had added them without their knowledge.) One Tennessee sheriff told the Southern Poverty Law Center, \"If you come in here trying to take up the guns, it's not going to be a nice day for somebody.\"\n\nMack told me that he has spoken at more than a hundred and twenty-five rallies. Many supporters were also Skousenites, because the conservative commentator Glenn Beck routinely touted Skousen's books. At C.S.P.O.A. workshops, everyone gets a Mad Libs-style workbook based on Skousen's \" The Making of America .\" Speakers emphasize the Second Amendment, the Fourth (searches and seizures), and the Tenth (states' rights). They portray officers as arbiters of morality and justice.\n\nMack personally disavows discrimination and infuses his lectures with the language of the civil-rights era. He likes to say, \"We should have never heard of Rosa Parks,\" explaining that a constitutional sheriff wouldn't have arrested her. Yet, according to his ideology, a sheriff could, for example, reject the Fourteenth Amendment, which granted citizenship and rights to former slaves. (Mack described such a scenario as a \"hypothetical,\" and said, \"I don't do hypotheticals. I deal with what's real.\") A speaker at one C.S.P.O.A. event I attended, an attorney, encouraged us to memorize the chorus of a song he'd written:\n\nNo matter what they told you all Courts and judges cannot make law The case law method has a fatal flaw Because courts cannot make law.\n\nMack brought Finch's case to the attention of the conservative media. Within days of Finch's arrest, the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was floating the notion on his Web site, Infowars, that the case was an example of political persecution. An Infowars contributor said that Finch had won office as a nonpartisan candidate, \"which to me is probably why you had a Republican governor sic his minions on this constitutional-following sheriff, because he owes his allegiance to no one.\" Soon Mack called into the Infowars talk show and raised the possibility that Finch's suspension was the result of an attempted coup. \"That's very common, to have enemies within,\" he said.\n\nAmid the flurry of coverage, a radio host named Burnie Thompson invited Finch on his afternoon show, on Talk Radio 101. Thompson prided himself on his independent thinking. \"I'm not one of these-what do they call them?-whatever, these fringe groups,\" Thompson told me. \"I'm a pretty mainstream guy. I'm an Air Force captain. I got a master's in journalism.\" Still, he was impressed by Finch's certainty that he'd done nothing wrong. After the interview, he read Mack's book about constitutional sheriffs and became a convert. During the next few months, he interviewed Finch around a dozen times, helped him raise money for his defense, and asked a listener to record a song about the case to the tune of Bob Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff,\" replacing \"shot\" with \"saved.\"\n\nThompson told me that, in a bid to get Finch's case thrown out, he had met with Governor Scott and his general counsel, Peter Antonacci. Thompson shared a theory with them, gleaned in part from Mack's book, that a sheriff can do whatever he wants in his own jail. Antonacci repeatedly told him that there was no legal precedent for this theory. \"I'm thinking, His chief counsel believes that?\" Thompson said. \"You know that feeling when you go, 'Oh, my God, the world's not what I thought it was'?\" (Neither Antonacci nor Scott's office responded to multiple requests for comment.)\n\nIn addition to official misconduct, a third-degree felony, Finch was charged with falsifying public records, a misdemeanor. Jack Campbell, the prosecutor in the case, told me, \"To me, it was always a public-records case. If you want to stop enforcing a law, O.K., I guess you can. You can fire all your deputies and just sit over there in your office all day, if that's what you want to do.\" He continued, \"But you're the sheriff: you can't hide and not tell people what you're doing.\"\n\nFinch's trial started just before Halloween. By then, his Facebook page had more likes than there are residents in Liberty County, and his defense fund had raised almost fifteen thousand dollars. \"Somebody even sent me money from Australia,\" Finch told me. There had been three rallies in three towns, the last in front of the Liberty County courthouse. More than a hundred people, some in American-flag shirts or scarves, strung up a Gadsden flag, set out lawn chairs and coolers, and waved signs: \"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty\"; \"Protect our Constitution\"; \"Nick Finch, the people's sheriff.\" One woman had strung a container of Bic Cover-it correction fluid around her neck, a nod to how Floyd Parrish's name had vanished from the jail records.\n\nOn the day Finch testified, the mood in the Liberty courthouse was as electric as the opening night of a play. Mack had flown in from Arizona. Reporters came from Tallahassee. Finch wore a dark jacket, a blue dotted tie, and beige slacks. On his right lapel was a tiny American-flag pin.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"Sheriff Finch,\" Campbell said, \"do you think you're above the law?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you think your judgment trumps everybody else's in the court system?\"\n\n\"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that you had the authority as a constitutional sheriff to do away with this case, on your own authority?\" Campbell asked.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Finch replied.\n\nThe case against Finch was mostly circumstantial. The jailer who'd been on duty that night testified that the sheriff walked out of the building with Parrish's file. \"Now, whether it's under his bed at the house, or it's out in the woods, or it's in the shredder in a burn pit, it doesn't make a hell of a difference. It's not where it belongs,\" Campbell told the jury. No one admitted to whiting out Parrish's name in the jail records, though investigators had a lab analyze the splotches, which proved that someone had. \"The fact is,\" Campbell argued, \"that the sheriff told this jury that he believes that his discretion allows him to decide which laws he's going to follow and which laws he's not. Ladies and gentlemen, if he's going to break the law concerning carry-and-conceal firearms, how are we to believe that he won't break the one for perjury in this trial?\"\n\nThe jury deliberated for about an hour, and found Finch not guilty on both counts. Finch hugged everyone within reach, made a few remarks to the TV scrum outside the courthouse, and then called Alex Jones, who told his audience, \"He needs to be the next governor-I'm telling you right now-of Florida. It's these type of men that stand up for the Constitution that are going to save this country.\"\n\nFinch, reinstated, sued the county for attorneys' fees and won about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars. The rest of his term was less triumphant. He fought with county commissioners over his budget. Three female employees sued him-two alleging gender discrimination in the department and one that he had sexually harassed her. Finch settled with all three. Trump's emergence as a Presidential front-runner was a rare bright spot for Finch, who said he was among the first sheriffs in Florida to endorse him. Finch got to meet the future President at a rally in Tampa. \"You know what?\" he told me. \"I look at Trump and I see myself. Because this guy is getting the shit beat out of him from Day One.\"\n\nFinch ran for reëlection in 2016. His chief opponent was Eddie Joe White, who was related to three previous Liberty County sheriffs, including one who was shot and killed in the line of duty in 1919. White chose a pointed campaign slogan: \"It's time we restore the trust.\" Finch's ads touted him as \"Your Constitutional Sheriff,\" but he and his wife, the Liberty County native, had divorced, and he knew this would count against him. Late one night about a month and a half before the election, Floyd Parrish and an acquaintance got into an argument. According to Parrish, the man, drunk and threatening, lunged at him, and he had no choice but to shoot. The man died. A deputy called Finch in the middle of the night to relay the news. Finch told me he thought, \"Jesus. I'm done. There's the election.\" He lost the sheriff's race, earning only six per cent of the vote.\n\nFor the constitutional-sheriffs movement, however, Finch's defeat didn't matter. The C.S.P.O.A. named him Sheriff of the Year in 2014, and Mack mentioned the trial in his book \" Are You a David? \" (The government is Goliath.) The movement's ideas have now spread far beyond a few renegade sheriffs. In Nevada, for example, members of the Bundy family have emerged as leaders of a movement to wrest control of public lands from Washington. During an armed standoff on the ranch of the family patriarch, Cliven Bundy, which drew anti-government crowds from around the country, including several constitutional sheriffs, Bundy demanded that his local sheriff disarm federal authorities. The sheriff refused. Earlier this year, after charges against Bundy related to the standoff were dismissed, Bundy said to a TV reporter, \"I think we're going to protest the county sheriff: 'Why didn't you do your job?' \"\n\nIn 2015, a Nevada lawmaker introduced a bill to give sheriffs veto power over some federal law-enforcement activities. Last year, in Washington, D.C., Jason Chaffetz, at that time a U.S. representative from Utah, introduced a bill that would, in practice, transfer law-enforcement responsibilities to sheriffs on certain public lands. Soon after Trump took office, he met with representatives of the National Sheriffs' Association, including a sheriff from Pennsylvania who had served on C.S.P.O.A.'s advisory council, and one from North Carolina who had ties to the group. That summer, Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio, who is now running for the U.S. Senate in Arizona. A few years back, when Mack visited D.C. to decry the Obama Administration's immigration measures, only three lawmakers met with him. One was Jeff Sessions, now the Attorney General. Ryan Lenz, a senior investigative reporter at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told me that \"the migration of these ideas to the mainstream primed the election for Trump.\" Trump's election, in turn, \"finalized the migration.\"\n\nI met Finch one night in December at a McDonald's in Blountstown, Florida. We sat at a table near the window, the restaurant wreathed for the holiday. Finch was working as a long-haul trucker and had just finished a trip to South Carolina. He wore a Harley-Davidson T-shirt and a \"Thin Blue Line\" baseball cap; its insignia, an American flag with a single blue stripe, honors police. He recounted his time as sheriff, and when he got to the trial he stopped and shook his head. Occasionally, he strayed into national politics, asking, \"How in the hell does Hillary Clinton get to lie, cheat, steal, and probably kill, and nobody cares?\" As we talked, a former deputy stopped at our table and said, \"What's going on, Sheriff?\" Finch responded with a pained smile.\n\nFinch remains a powerful symbol for constitutional sheriffs. The day after Trump's Inauguration, under a gray, drizzling sky, I drove to an Embassy Suites near the Baltimore airport for a C.S.P.O.A. training workshop. While I waited at a table in the lobby for my packet-and my black-and-gold lanyard that said I was part of the \"posse\"-a group of pink pussy-hatted women passed by, on their way to the Women's March in Washington. In a conference room, the C.S.P.O.A. audience flipped through their \"Making of America\" booklets. Mack wasn't there, but, via a video monitor, he introduced Finch as a sheriff whose \"strong stand for freedom\" had cost him his badge. Finch stood up, put his hand over his heart, and led the room in the Pledge of Allegiance. ♦\n\nReporting for this piece was supported by a grant from the Reporting Award at N.Y.U.'s Arthur L.

      "text": "The Invention of the Police\n\nTo police is to maintain law and order, but the word derives from polis -the Greek for \"city,\" or \"polity\"-by way of politia , the Latin for \"citizenship,\" and it entered English from the Middle French police , which meant not constables but government. \"The police,\" as a civil force charged with deterring crime, came to the United States from England and is generally associated with monarchy-\"keeping the king's peace\"-which makes it surprising that, in the antimonarchical United States, it got so big, so fast. The reason is, mainly, slavery.\n\n\"Abolish the police,\" as a rallying cry, dates to 1988 (the year that N.W.A. recorded \"Fuck tha Police\"), but, long before anyone called for its abolition, someone had to invent the police: the ancient Greek polis had to become the modern police. \"To be political, to live in a polis , meant that everything was decided through words and persuasion and not through force and violence,\" Hannah Arendt wrote in \" The Human Condition .\" In the polis, men argued and debated, as equals, under a rule of law. Outside the polis, in households, men dominated women, children, servants, and slaves, under a rule of force. This division of government sailed down the river of time like a raft, getting battered, but also bigger, collecting sticks and mud. Kings asserted a rule of force over their subjects on the idea that their kingdom was their household. In 1769, William Blackstone, in his \" Commentaries on the Laws of England ,\" argued that the king, as \"pater-familias of the nation,\" directs \"the public police,\" exercising the means by which \"the individuals of the state, like members of a well-governed family, are bound to conform their general behavior to the rules of propriety, good neighbourhood, and good manners; and to be decent, industrious, and inoffensive in their respective stations.\" The police are the king's men.\n\nHistory begins with etymology, but it doesn't end there. The polis is not the police. The American Revolution toppled the power of the king over his people-in America, \"the law is king,\" Thomas Paine wrote-but not the power of a man over his family. The power of the police has its origins in that kind of power. Under the rule of law, people are equals; under the rule of police, as the legal theorist Markus Dubber has written, we are not. We are more like the women, children, servants, and slaves in a household in ancient Greece, the people who were not allowed to be a part of the polis. But for centuries, through struggles for independence, emancipation, enfranchisement, and equal rights, we've been fighting to enter the polis. One way to think about \"Abolish the police,\" then, is as an argument that, now that all of us have finally clawed our way into the polis, the police are obsolete.\n\nBut are they? The crisis in policing is the culmination of a thousand other failures-failures of education, social services, public health, gun regulation, criminal justice, and economic development. Police have a lot in common with firefighters, E.M.T.s, and paramedics: they're there to help, often at great sacrifice, and by placing themselves in harm's way. To say that this doesn't always work out, however, does not begin to cover the size of the problem. The killing of George Floyd , in Minneapolis, cannot be wished away as an outlier. In each of the past five years, police in the United States have killed roughly a thousand people. (During each of those same years, about a hundred police officers were killed in the line of duty.) One study suggests that, among American men between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four, the number who were treated in emergency rooms as a result of injuries inflicted by police and security guards was almost as great as the number who, as pedestrians, were injured by motor vehicles. Urban police forces are nearly always whiter than the communities they patrol. The victims of police brutality are disproportionately Black teen-age boys: children. To say that many good and admirable people are police officers, dedicated and brave public servants, which is, of course, true, is to fail to address both the nature and the scale of the crisis and the legacy of centuries of racial injustice. The best people, with the best of intentions, doing their utmost, cannot fix this system from within.\n\nThere are nearly seven hundred thousand police officers in the United States, about two for every thousand people, a rate that is lower than the European average. The difference is guns. Police in Finland fired six bullets in all of 2013; in an encounter on a single day in the year 2015, in Pasco, Washington, three policemen fired seventeen bullets when they shot and killed an unarmed thirty-five-year-old orchard worker from Mexico. Five years ago, when the Guardian counted police killings, it reported that, \"in the first 24 days of 2015, police in the US fatally shot more people than police did in England and Wales, combined, over the past 24 years.\" American police are armed to the teeth, with more than seven billion dollars' worth of surplus military equipment off-loaded by the Pentagon to eight thousand law-enforcement agencies since 1997. At the same time, they face the most heavily armed civilian population in the world: one in three Americans owns a gun, typically more than one. Gun violence undermines civilian life and debases everyone. A study found that, given the ravages of stress, white male police officers in Buffalo have a life expectancy twenty-two years shorter than that of the average American male. The debate about policing also has to do with all the money that's spent paying heavily armed agents of the state to do things that they aren't trained to do and that other institutions would do better. History haunts this debate like a bullet-riddled ghost.\n\nThat history begins in England, in the thirteenth century, when maintaining the king's peace became the duty of an officer of the court called a constable, aided by his watchmen: every male adult could be called on to take a turn walking a ward at night and, if trouble came, to raise a hue and cry. This practice lasted for centuries. (A version endures: George Zimmerman, when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin , in 2012, was serving on his neighborhood watch.) The watch didn't work especially well in England-\"The average constable is an ignoramus who knows little or nothing of the law,\" Blackstone wrote-and it didn't work especially well in England's colonies. Rich men paid poor men to take their turns on the watch, which meant that most watchmen were either very elderly or very poor, and very exhausted from working all day. Boston established a watch in 1631. New York tried paying watchmen in 1658. In Philadelphia, in 1705, the governor expressed the view that the militia could make the city safer than the watch, but militias weren't supposed to police the king's subjects; they were supposed to serve the common defense-waging wars against the French, fighting Native peoples who were trying to hold on to their lands, or suppressing slave rebellions.\n\nThe government of slavery was not a rule of law. It was a rule of police. In 1661, the English colony of Barbados passed its first slave law; revised in 1688, it decreed that \"Negroes and other Slaves\" were \"wholly unqualified to be governed by the Laws . . . of our Nations,\" and devised, instead, a special set of rules \"for the good Regulating and Ordering of them.\" Virginia adopted similar measures, known as slave codes, in 1680:\n\nIt shall not be lawfull for any negroe or other slave to carry or arme himselfe with any club, staffe, gunn, sword or any other weapon of defence or offence, nor to goe or depart from of his masters ground without a certificate from his master, mistris or overseer, and such permission not to be granted but upon perticuler and necessary occasions; and every negroe or slave soe offending not haveing a certificate as aforesaid shalbe sent to the next constable, who is hereby enjoyned and required to give the said negroe twenty lashes on his bare back well layd on, and soe sent home to his said master, mistris or overseer . . . that if any negroe or other slave shall absent himself from his masters service and lye hid and lurking in obscure places, comitting injuries to the inhabitants, and shall resist any person or persons that shalby any lawfull authority be imployed to apprehend and take the said negroe, that then in case of such resistance, it shalbe lawfull for such person or persons to kill the said negroe or slave soe lying out and resisting.\n\nIn eighteenth-century New York, a person held as a slave could not gather in a group of more than three; could not ride a horse; could not hold a funeral at night; could not be out an hour after sunset without a lantern; and could not sell \"Indian corn, peaches, or any other fruit\" in any street or market in the city. Stop and frisk, stop and whip, shoot to kill.\n\nLink copied\n\nThen there were the slave patrols. Armed Spanish bands called hermandades had hunted runaways in Cuba beginning in the fifteen-thirties, a practice that was adopted by the English in Barbados a century later. It had a lot in common with England's posse comitatus, a band of stout men that a county sheriff could summon to chase down an escaped criminal. South Carolina, founded by slaveowners from Barbados, authorized its first slave patrol in 1702; Virginia followed in 1726, North Carolina in 1753. Slave patrols married the watch to the militia: serving on patrol was required of all able-bodied men (often, the patrol was mustered from the militia), and patrollers used the hue and cry to call for anyone within hearing distance to join the chase. Neither the watch nor the militia nor the patrols were \"police,\" who were French, and considered despotic. In North America, the French city of New Orleans was distinctive in having la police: armed City Guards, who wore military-style uniforms and received wages, an urban slave patrol.\n\nIn 1779, Thomas Jefferson created a chair in \"law and police\" at the College of William & Mary. The meaning of the word began to change. In 1789, Jeremy Bentham, noting that \"police\" had recently entered the English language, in something like its modern sense, made this distinction: police keep the peace; justice punishes disorder. (\"No justice, no peace!\" Black Lives Matter protesters cry in the streets.) Then, in 1797, a London magistrate named Patrick Colquhoun published \"A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis.\" He, too, distinguished peace kept in the streets from justice administered by the courts: police were responsible for the regulation and correction of behavior and \"the PREVENTION and DETECTION OF CRIMES .\"\n\nIt is often said that Britain created the police, and the United States copied it. One could argue that the reverse is true. Colquhoun spent his teens and early twenties in Colonial Virginia, had served as an agent for British cotton manufacturers, and owned shares in sugar plantations in Jamaica. He knew all about slave codes and slave patrols. But nothing came of Colquhoun's ideas about policing until 1829, when Home Secretary Robert Peel-in the wake of a great deal of labor unrest, and after years of suppressing Catholic rebellions in Ireland, in his capacity as Irish Secretary-persuaded Parliament to establish the Metropolitan Police, a force of some three thousand men, headed by two civilian justices (later called \"commissioners\"), and organized like an army, with each superintendent overseeing four inspectors, sixteen sergeants, and a hundred and sixty-five constables, who wore coats and pants of blue with black top hats, each assigned a numbered badge and a baton. Londoners came to call these men \"bobbies,\" for Bobby Peel.\n\nIt is also often said that modern American urban policing began in 1838, when the Massachusetts legislature authorized the hiring of police officers in Boston. This, too, ignores the role of slavery in the history of the police. In 1829, a Black abolitionist in Boston named David Walker published \" An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World ,\" calling for violent rebellion: \"One good black man can put to death six white men.\" Walker was found dead within the year, and Boston thereafter had a series of mob attacks against abolitionists, including an attempt to lynch William Lloyd Garrison, the publisher of The Liberator, in 1835. Walker's words terrified Southern slaveowners. The governor of North Carolina wrote to his state's senators, \"I beg you will lay this matter before the police of your town and invite their prompt attention to the necessity of arresting the circulation of the book.\" By \"police,\" he meant slave patrols: in response to Walker's \"Appeal,\" North Carolina formed a statewide \"patrol committee.\"\n\nNew York established a police department in 1844; New Orleans and Cincinnati followed in 1852, then, later in the eighteen-fifties, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Baltimore. Population growth, the widening inequality brought about by the Industrial Revolution, and the rise in such crimes as prostitution and burglary all contributed to the emergence of urban policing. So did immigration, especially from Ireland and Germany, and the hostility to immigration: a new party, the Know-Nothings, sought to prevent immigrants from voting, holding office, and becoming citizens. In 1854, Boston disbanded its ancient watch and formally established a police department; that year, Know-Nothings swept the city's elections.\n\nAmerican police differed from their English counterparts: in the U.S., police commissioners, as political appointees, fell under local control, with limited supervision; and law enforcement was decentralized, resulting in a jurisdictional thicket. In 1857, in the Great Police Riot, the New York Municipal Police, run by the mayor's office, fought on the steps of city hall with the New York Metropolitan Police, run by the state. The Metropolitans were known as the New York Mets. That year, an amateur baseball team of the same name was founded.\n\nAlso, unlike their British counterparts, American police carried guns, initially their own. In the eighteen-sixties, the Colt Firearms Company began manufacturing a compact revolver called a Pocket Police Model, long before the New York Metropolitan Police began issuing service weapons. American police carried guns because Americans carried guns, including Americans who lived in parts of the country where they hunted for food and defended their livestock from wild animals, Americans who lived in parts of the country that had no police, and Americans who lived in parts of North America that were not in the United States. Outside big cities, law-enforcement officers were scarce. In territories that weren't yet states, there were U.S. marshals and their deputies, officers of the federal courts who could act as de-facto police, but only to enforce federal laws. If a territory became a state, its counties would elect sheriffs. Meanwhile, Americans became vigilantes, especially likely to kill indigenous peoples, and to lynch people of color. Between 1840 and the nineteen-twenties, mobs, vigilantes, and law officers, including the Texas Rangers, lynched some five hundred Mexicans and Mexican-Americans and killed thousands more, not only in Texas but also in territories that became the states of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. A San Francisco vigilance committee established in 1851 arrested, tried, and hanged people; it boasted a membership in the thousands. An L.A. vigilance committee targeted and lynched Chinese immigrants.\n\nThe U.S. Army operated as a police force, too. After the Civil War, the militia was organized into seven new departments of permanent standing armies: the Department of Dakota, the Department of the Platte, the Department of the Missouri, the Department of Texas, the Department of Arizona, the Department of California, and the Department of the Columbian. In the eighteen-seventies and eighties, the U.S. Army engaged in more than a thousand combat operations against Native peoples. In 1890, at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, following an attempt to disarm a Lakota settlement, a regiment of cavalrymen massacred hundreds of Lakota men, women, and children. Nearly a century later, in 1973, F.B.I. agents, SWAT teams, and federal troops and state marshals laid siege to Wounded Knee during a protest over police brutality and the failure to properly punish the torture and murder of an Oglala Sioux man named Raymond Yellow Thunder. They fired more than half a million rounds of ammunition and arrested more than a thousand people. Today, according to the C.D.C., Native Americans are more likely to be killed by the police than any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nModern American policing began in 1909, when August Vollmer became the chief of the police department in Berkeley, California. Vollmer refashioned American police into an American military. He'd served with the Eighth Army Corps in the Philippines in 1898. \"For years, ever since Spanish-American War days, I've studied military tactics and used them to good effect in rounding up crooks,\" he later explained. \"After all we're conducting a war, a war against the enemies of society.\" Who were those enemies? Mobsters, bootleggers, socialist agitators, strikers, union organizers, immigrants, and Black people.\n\nTo domestic policing, Vollmer and his peers adapted the kinds of tactics and weapons that had been deployed against Native Americans in the West and against colonized peoples in other parts of the world, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, as the sociologist Julian Go has demonstrated. Vollmer instituted a training model imitated all over the country, by police departments that were often led and staffed by other veterans of the United States wars of conquest and occupation. A \"police captain or lieutenant should occupy exactly the same position in the public mind as that of a captain or lieutenant in the United States army,\" Detroit's commissioner of police said. (Today's police officers are disproportionately veterans of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, many suffering from post-traumatic stress. The Marshall Project, analyzing data from the Albuquerque police, found that officers who are veterans are more likely than their non-veteran counterparts to be involved in fatal shootings. In general, they are more likely to use force, and more likely to fire their guns.)\n\nVollmer-era police enforced a new kind of slave code: Jim Crow laws, which had been passed in the South beginning in the late eighteen-seventies and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1896. William G. Austin became Savannah's chief of police in 1907. Earlier, he had earned a Medal of Honor for his service in the U.S. Cavalry at Wounded Knee; he had also fought in the Spanish-American War. By 1916, African-American churches in the city were complaining to Savannah newspapers about the \"whole scale arrests of negroes because they are negroes-arrests that would not be made if they were white under similar circumstances.\" African-Americans also confronted Jim Crow policing in the Northern cities to which they increasingly fled. James Robinson, Philadelphia's chief of police beginning in 1912, had served in the Infantry during the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War. He based his force's training on manuals used by the U.S. Army at Leavenworth. Go reports that, in 1911, about eleven per cent of people arrested were African-American; under Robinson, that number rose to 14.6 per cent in 1917. By the nineteen-twenties, a quarter of those arrested were African-Americans, who, at the time, represented just 7.4 per cent of the population.\n\nProgressive Era, Vollmer-style policing criminalized Blackness, as the historian Khalil Gibran Muhammad argued in his 2010 book, \" The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America .\" Police patrolled Black neighborhoods and arrested Black people disproportionately; prosecutors indicted Black people disproportionately; juries found Black people guilty disproportionately; judges gave Black people disproportionately long sentences; and, then, after all this, social scientists, observing the number of Black people in jail, decided that, as a matter of biology, Black people were disproportionately inclined to criminality.\n\nMore recently, between the New Jim Crow and the criminalization of immigration and the imprisonment of immigrants in detention centers, this reality has only grown worse. \"By population, by per capita incarceration rates, and by expenditures, the United States exceeds all other nations in how many of its citizens, asylum seekers, and undocumented immigrants are under some form of criminal justice supervision,\" Muhammad writes in a new preface to his book. \"The number of African American and Latinx people in American jails and prisons today exceeds the entire populations of some African, Eastern European, and Caribbean countries.\"\n\nPolicing grew harsher in the Progressive Era, and, with the emergence of state-police forces, the number of police grew, too. With the rise of the automobile, some, like California's, began as \"highway patrols.\" Others, including the state police in Nevada, Colorado, and Oregon, began as the private paramilitaries of industrialists which employed the newest American immigrants: Hungarians, Italians, and Jews. Industrialists in Pennsylvania established the Iron and Coal Police to end strikes and bust unions, including the United Mine Workers; in 1905, three years after an anthracite-coal strike, the Pennsylvania State Police started operations. \"One State Policeman should be able to handle one hundred foreigners,\" its new chief said.\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol began in 1924, the year that Congress restricted immigration from southern Europe. At the insistence of Southern and Western agriculturalists, Congress exempted Mexicans from its new immigration quotas in order to allow migrant workers to enter the United States. The Border Patrol began as a relatively small outfit responsible for enforcing federal immigration law, and stopping smugglers, at all of the nation's borders. In the middle decades of the twentieth century, it grew to a national quasi-military focussed on policing the southern border in campaigns of mass arrest and forced deportation of Mexican immigrants, aided by local police like the notoriously brutal L.A.P.D., as the historian Kelly Lytle Hernández has chronicled. What became the Chicano movement began in Southern California, with Mexican immigrants' protests of the L.A.P.D. during the first half of the twentieth century, even as a growing film industry cranked out features about Klansmen hunting Black people, cowboys killing Indians, and police chasing Mexicans. More recently, you can find an updated version of this story in L.A. Noire, a video game set in 1947 and played from the perspective of a well-armed L.A.P.D. officer, who, driving along Sunset Boulevard, passes the crumbling, abandoned sets from D. W. Griffith's 1916 film \"Intolerance,\" imagined relics of an unforgiving age.\n\nTwo kinds of police appeared on mid-century American television. The good guys solved crime on prime-time police procedurals like \"Dragnet,\" starting in 1951, and \"Adam-12,\" beginning in 1968 (both featured the L.A.P.D.). The bad guys shocked America's conscience on the nightly news: Arkansas state troopers barring Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School, in 1957; Birmingham police clubbing and arresting some seven hundred Black children protesting segregation, in 1963; and Alabama state troopers beating voting-rights marchers at Selma, in 1965. These two faces of policing help explain how, in the nineteen-sixties, the more people protested police brutality, the more money governments gave to police departments.\n\nIn 1965, President Lyndon Johnson declared a \"war on crime,\" and asked Congress to pass the Law Enforcement Assistance Act, under which the federal government would supply local police with military-grade weapons, weapons that were being used in the war in Vietnam. During riots in Watts that summer, law enforcement killed thirty-one people and arrested more than four thousand; fighting the protesters, the head of the L.A.P.D. said, was \"very much like fighting the Viet Cong.\" Preparing for a Senate vote just days after the uprising ended, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee said, \"For some time, it has been my feeling that the task of law enforcement agencies is really not much different from military forces; namely, to deter crime before it occurs, just as our military objective is deterrence of aggression.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAs Elizabeth Hinton reported in \" From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America ,\" the \"frontline soldiers\" in Johnson's war on crime-Vollmer-era policing all over again-spent a disproportionate amount of time patrolling Black neighborhoods and arresting Black people. Policymakers concluded from those differential arrest rates that Black people were prone to criminality, with the result that police spent even more of their time patrolling Black neighborhoods, which led to a still higher arrest rate. \"If we wish to rid this country of crime, if we wish to stop hacking at its branches only, we must cut its roots and drain its swampy breeding ground, the slum,\" Johnson told an audience of police policymakers in 1966. The next year, riots broke out in Newark and Detroit. \"We ain't rioting agains' all you whites,\" one Newark man told a reporter not long before being shot dead by police. \"We're riotin' agains' police brutality.\" In Detroit, police arrested more than seven thousand people.\n\nJohnson's Great Society essentially ended when he asked Congress to pass the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, which had the effect of diverting money from social programs to policing. This magazine called it \"a piece of demagoguery devised out of malevolence and enacted in hysteria.\" James Baldwin attributed its \"irresponsible ferocity\" to \"some pale, compelling nightmare-an overwhelming collection of private nightmares.\" The truth was darker, as the sociologist Stuart Schrader chronicled in his 2019 book, \" Badges Without Borders: How Global Counterinsurgency Transformed American Policing .\" During the Cold War, the Office of Public Safety at the U.S.A.I.D. provided assistance to the police in at least fifty-two countries, and training to officers from nearly eighty, for the purpose of counter-insurgency-the suppression of an anticipated revolution, that collection of private nightmares; as the O.P.S. reported, it contributed \"the international dimension to the Administration's War on Crime.\" Counter-insurgency boomeranged, and came back to the United States, as policing.\n\nIn 1968, Johnson's new crime bill established the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, within the Department of Justice, which, in the next decade and a half, disbursed federal funds to more than eighty thousand crime-control projects. Even funds intended for social projects-youth employment, for instance, along with other health, education, housing, and welfare programs-were distributed to police operations. With Richard Nixon, any elements of the Great Society that had survived the disastrous end of Johnson's Presidency were drastically cut, with an increased emphasis on policing, and prison-building. More Americans went to prison between 1965 and 1982 than between 1865 and 1964, Hinton reports. Under Ronald Reagan, still more social services were closed, or starved of funding until they died: mental hospitals, health centers, jobs programs, early-childhood education. By 2016, eighteen states were spending more on prisons than on colleges and universities. Activists who today call for defunding the police argue that, for decades, Americans have been defunding not only social services but, in many states, public education itself. The more frayed the social fabric, the more police have been deployed to trim the dangling threads.\n\nThe blueprint for law enforcement from Nixon to Reagan came from the Harvard political scientist James Q. Wilson between 1968, in his book \" Varieties of Police Behavior ,\" and 1982, in an essay in The Atlantic titled \"Broken Windows.\" On the one hand, Wilson believed that the police should shift from enforcing the law to maintaining order, by patrolling on foot, and doing what came to be called \"community policing.\" (Some of his recommendations were ignored: Wilson called for other professionals to handle what he termed the \"service functions\" of the police-\"first aid, rescuing cats, helping ladies, and the like\"-which is a reform people are asking for today.) On the other hand, Wilson called for police to arrest people for petty crimes, on the theory that they contributed to more serious crimes. Wilson's work informed programs like Detroit's STRESS (Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets), begun in 1971, in which Detroit police patrolled the city undercover, in disguises that included everything from a taxi-driver to a \"radical college professor,\" and killed so many young Black men that an organization of Black police officers demanded that the unit be disbanded. The campaign to end STRESS arguably marked the very beginnings of police abolitionism. STRESS defended its methods. \"We just don't walk up and shoot somebody,\" one commander said. \"We ask him to stop. If he doesn't, we shoot.\"\n\nFor decades, the war on crime was bipartisan, and had substantial support from the Congressional Black Caucus. \"Crime is a national-defense problem,\" Joe Biden said in the Senate, in 1982. \"You're in as much jeopardy in the streets as you are from a Soviet missile.\" Biden and other Democrats in the Senate introduced legislation that resulted in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. A decade later, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden helped draft the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, whose provisions included mandatory sentencing. In May, 1991, two months after the Rodney King beating, Biden introduced the Police Officers' Bill of Rights, which provided protections for police under investigation. The N.R.A. first endorsed a Presidential candidate, Reagan, in 1980; the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation's largest police union, first endorsed a Presidential candidate, George H. W. Bush, in 1988. In 1996, it endorsed Bill Clinton.\n\nPartly because of Biden's record of championing law enforcement, the National Association of Police Organizations endorsed the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012. In 2014, after police in Ferguson, Missouri, shot Michael Brown, the Obama Administration established a task force on policing in the twenty-first century. Its report argued that police had become warriors when what they really should be is guardians. Most of its recommendations were never implemented.\n\nIn 2016, the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump, saying that \"our members believe he will make America safe again.\" Police unions are lining up behind Trump again this year. \"We will never abolish our police or our great Second Amendment,\" Trump said at Mt. Rushmore , on the occasion of the Fourth of July. \"We will not be intimidated by bad, evil people.\"\n\nTrump is not the king; the law is king. The police are not the king's men; they are public servants. And, no matter how desperately Trump would like to make it so, policing really isn't a partisan issue. Out of the stillness of the shutdown, the voices of protest have roared like summer thunder. An overwhelming majority of Americans, of both parties, support major reforms in American policing. And a whole lot of police, defying their unions, also support those reforms.\n\nThose changes won't address plenty of bigger crises, not least because the problem of policing can't be solved without addressing the problem of guns. But this much is clear: the polis has changed, and the police will have to change, too. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this piece misrepresented the number of Americans between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four who were treated as a result of police-inflicted injuries in emergency rooms.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Invention of the Police\n\nTo police is to maintain law and order, but the word derives from polis -the Greek for \"city,\" or \"polity\"-by way of politia , the Latin for \"citizenship,\" and it entered English from the Middle French police , which meant not constables but government. \"The police,\" as a civil force charged with deterring crime, came to the United States from England and is generally associated with monarchy-\"keeping the king's peace\"-which makes it surprising that, in the antimonarchical United States, it got so big, so fast. The reason is, mainly, slavery.\n\n\"Abolish the police,\" as a rallying cry, dates to 1988 (the year that N.W.A. recorded \"Fuck tha Police\"), but, long before anyone called for its abolition, someone had to invent the police: the ancient Greek polis had to become the modern police. \"To be political, to live in a polis , meant that everything was decided through words and persuasion and not through force and violence,\" Hannah Arendt wrote in \" The Human Condition .\" In the polis, men argued and debated, as equals, under a rule of law. Outside the polis, in households, men dominated women, children, servants, and slaves, under a rule of force. This division of government sailed down the river of time like a raft, getting battered, but also bigger, collecting sticks and mud. Kings asserted a rule of force over their subjects on the idea that their kingdom was their household. In 1769, William Blackstone, in his \" Commentaries on the Laws of England ,\" argued that the king, as \"pater-familias of the nation,\" directs \"the public police,\" exercising the means by which \"the individuals of the state, like members of a well-governed family, are bound to conform their general behavior to the rules of propriety, good neighbourhood, and good manners; and to be decent, industrious, and inoffensive in their respective stations.\" The police are the king's men.\n\nHistory begins with etymology, but it doesn't end there. The polis is not the police. The American Revolution toppled the power of the king over his people-in America, \"the law is king,\" Thomas Paine wrote-but not the power of a man over his family. The power of the police has its origins in that kind of power. Under the rule of law, people are equals; under the rule of police, as the legal theorist Markus Dubber has written, we are not. We are more like the women, children, servants, and slaves in a household in ancient Greece, the people who were not allowed to be a part of the polis. But for centuries, through struggles for independence, emancipation, enfranchisement, and equal rights, we've been fighting to enter the polis. One way to think about \"Abolish the police,\" then, is as an argument that, now that all of us have finally clawed our way into the polis, the police are obsolete.\n\nBut are they? The crisis in policing is the culmination of a thousand other failures-failures of education, social services, public health, gun regulation, criminal justice, and economic development. Police have a lot in common with firefighters, E.M.T.s, and paramedics: they're there to help, often at great sacrifice, and by placing themselves in harm's way. To say that this doesn't always work out, however, does not begin to cover the size of the problem. The killing of George Floyd , in Minneapolis, cannot be wished away as an outlier. In each of the past five years, police in the United States have killed roughly a thousand people. (During each of those same years, about a hundred police officers were killed in the line of duty.) One study suggests that, among American men between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four, the number who were treated in emergency rooms as a result of injuries inflicted by police and security guards was almost as great as the number who, as pedestrians, were injured by motor vehicles. Urban police forces are nearly always whiter than the communities they patrol. The victims of police brutality are disproportionately Black teen-age boys: children. To say that many good and admirable people are police officers, dedicated and brave public servants, which is, of course, true, is to fail to address both the nature and the scale of the crisis and the legacy of centuries of racial injustice. The best people, with the best of intentions, doing their utmost, cannot fix this system from within.\n\nThere are nearly seven hundred thousand police officers in the United States, about two for every thousand people, a rate that is lower than the European average. The difference is guns. Police in Finland fired six bullets in all of 2013; in an encounter on a single day in the year 2015, in Pasco, Washington, three policemen fired seventeen bullets when they shot and killed an unarmed thirty-five-year-old orchard worker from Mexico. Five years ago, when the Guardian counted police killings, it reported that, \"in the first 24 days of 2015, police in the US fatally shot more people than police did in England and Wales, combined, over the past 24 years.\" American police are armed to the teeth, with more than seven billion dollars' worth of surplus military equipment off-loaded by the Pentagon to eight thousand law-enforcement agencies since 1997. At the same time, they face the most heavily armed civilian population in the world: one in three Americans owns a gun, typically more than one. Gun violence undermines civilian life and debases everyone. A study found that, given the ravages of stress, white male police officers in Buffalo have a life expectancy twenty-two years shorter than that of the average American male. The debate about policing also has to do with all the money that's spent paying heavily armed agents of the state to do things that they aren't trained to do and that other institutions would do better. History haunts this debate like a bullet-riddled ghost.\n\nThat history begins in England, in the thirteenth century, when maintaining the king's peace became the duty of an officer of the court called a constable, aided by his watchmen: every male adult could be called on to take a turn walking a ward at night and, if trouble came, to raise a hue and cry. This practice lasted for centuries. (A version endures: George Zimmerman, when he shot and killed Trayvon Martin , in 2012, was serving on his neighborhood watch.) The watch didn't work especially well in England-\"The average constable is an ignoramus who knows little or nothing of the law,\" Blackstone wrote-and it didn't work especially well in England's colonies. Rich men paid poor men to take their turns on the watch, which meant that most watchmen were either very elderly or very poor, and very exhausted from working all day. Boston established a watch in 1631. New York tried paying watchmen in 1658. In Philadelphia, in 1705, the governor expressed the view that the militia could make the city safer than the watch, but militias weren't supposed to police the king's subjects; they were supposed to serve the common defense-waging wars against the French, fighting Native peoples who were trying to hold on to their lands, or suppressing slave rebellions.\n\nThe government of slavery was not a rule of law. It was a rule of police. In 1661, the English colony of Barbados passed its first slave law; revised in 1688, it decreed that \"Negroes and other Slaves\" were \"wholly unqualified to be governed by the Laws . . . of our Nations,\" and devised, instead, a special set of rules \"for the good Regulating and Ordering of them.\" Virginia adopted similar measures, known as slave codes, in 1680:\n\nIt shall not be lawfull for any negroe or other slave to carry or arme himselfe with any club, staffe, gunn, sword or any other weapon of defence or offence, nor to goe or depart from of his masters ground without a certificate from his master, mistris or overseer, and such permission not to be granted but upon perticuler and necessary occasions; and every negroe or slave soe offending not haveing a certificate as aforesaid shalbe sent to the next constable, who is hereby enjoyned and required to give the said negroe twenty lashes on his bare back well layd on, and soe sent home to his said master, mistris or overseer . . . that if any negroe or other slave shall absent himself from his masters service and lye hid and lurking in obscure places, comitting injuries to the inhabitants, and shall resist any person or persons that shalby any lawfull authority be imployed to apprehend and take the said negroe, that then in case of such resistance, it shalbe lawfull for such person or persons to kill the said negroe or slave soe lying out and resisting.\n\nIn eighteenth-century New York, a person held as a slave could not gather in a group of more than three; could not ride a horse; could not hold a funeral at night; could not be out an hour after sunset without a lantern; and could not sell \"Indian corn, peaches, or any other fruit\" in any street or market in the city. Stop and frisk, stop and whip, shoot to kill.\n\nLink copied\n\nThen there were the slave patrols. Armed Spanish bands called hermandades had hunted runaways in Cuba beginning in the fifteen-thirties, a practice that was adopted by the English in Barbados a century later. It had a lot in common with England's posse comitatus, a band of stout men that a county sheriff could summon to chase down an escaped criminal. South Carolina, founded by slaveowners from Barbados, authorized its first slave patrol in 1702; Virginia followed in 1726, North Carolina in 1753. Slave patrols married the watch to the militia: serving on patrol was required of all able-bodied men (often, the patrol was mustered from the militia), and patrollers used the hue and cry to call for anyone within hearing distance to join the chase. Neither the watch nor the militia nor the patrols were \"police,\" who were French, and considered despotic. In North America, the French city of New Orleans was distinctive in having la police: armed City Guards, who wore military-style uniforms and received wages, an urban slave patrol.\n\nIn 1779, Thomas Jefferson created a chair in \"law and police\" at the College of William & Mary. The meaning of the word began to change. In 1789, Jeremy Bentham, noting that \"police\" had recently entered the English language, in something like its modern sense, made this distinction: police keep the peace; justice punishes disorder. (\"No justice, no peace!\" Black Lives Matter protesters cry in the streets.) Then, in 1797, a London magistrate named Patrick Colquhoun published \"A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis.\" He, too, distinguished peace kept in the streets from justice administered by the courts: police were responsible for the regulation and correction of behavior and \"the PREVENTION and DETECTION OF CRIMES .\"\n\nIt is often said that Britain created the police, and the United States copied it. One could argue that the reverse is true. Colquhoun spent his teens and early twenties in Colonial Virginia, had served as an agent for British cotton manufacturers, and owned shares in sugar plantations in Jamaica. He knew all about slave codes and slave patrols. But nothing came of Colquhoun's ideas about policing until 1829, when Home Secretary Robert Peel-in the wake of a great deal of labor unrest, and after years of suppressing Catholic rebellions in Ireland, in his capacity as Irish Secretary-persuaded Parliament to establish the Metropolitan Police, a force of some three thousand men, headed by two civilian justices (later called \"commissioners\"), and organized like an army, with each superintendent overseeing four inspectors, sixteen sergeants, and a hundred and sixty-five constables, who wore coats and pants of blue with black top hats, each assigned a numbered badge and a baton. Londoners came to call these men \"bobbies,\" for Bobby Peel.\n\nIt is also often said that modern American urban policing began in 1838, when the Massachusetts legislature authorized the hiring of police officers in Boston. This, too, ignores the role of slavery in the history of the police. In 1829, a Black abolitionist in Boston named David Walker published \" An Appeal to the Coloured Citizens of the World ,\" calling for violent rebellion: \"One good black man can put to death six white men.\" Walker was found dead within the year, and Boston thereafter had a series of mob attacks against abolitionists, including an attempt to lynch William Lloyd Garrison, the publisher of The Liberator, in 1835. Walker's words terrified Southern slaveowners. The governor of North Carolina wrote to his state's senators, \"I beg you will lay this matter before the police of your town and invite their prompt attention to the necessity of arresting the circulation of the book.\" By \"police,\" he meant slave patrols: in response to Walker's \"Appeal,\" North Carolina formed a statewide \"patrol committee.\"\n\nNew York established a police department in 1844; New Orleans and Cincinnati followed in 1852, then, later in the eighteen-fifties, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Baltimore. Population growth, the widening inequality brought about by the Industrial Revolution, and the rise in such crimes as prostitution and burglary all contributed to the emergence of urban policing. So did immigration, especially from Ireland and Germany, and the hostility to immigration: a new party, the Know-Nothings, sought to prevent immigrants from voting, holding office, and becoming citizens. In 1854, Boston disbanded its ancient watch and formally established a police department; that year, Know-Nothings swept the city's elections.\n\nAmerican police differed from their English counterparts: in the U.S., police commissioners, as political appointees, fell under local control, with limited supervision; and law enforcement was decentralized, resulting in a jurisdictional thicket. In 1857, in the Great Police Riot, the New York Municipal Police, run by the mayor's office, fought on the steps of city hall with the New York Metropolitan Police, run by the state. The Metropolitans were known as the New York Mets. That year, an amateur baseball team of the same name was founded.\n\nAlso, unlike their British counterparts, American police carried guns, initially their own. In the eighteen-sixties, the Colt Firearms Company began manufacturing a compact revolver called a Pocket Police Model, long before the New York Metropolitan Police began issuing service weapons. American police carried guns because Americans carried guns, including Americans who lived in parts of the country where they hunted for food and defended their livestock from wild animals, Americans who lived in parts of the country that had no police, and Americans who lived in parts of North America that were not in the United States. Outside big cities, law-enforcement officers were scarce. In territories that weren't yet states, there were U.S. marshals and their deputies, officers of the federal courts who could act as de-facto police, but only to enforce federal laws. If a territory became a state, its counties would elect sheriffs. Meanwhile, Americans became vigilantes, especially likely to kill indigenous peoples, and to lynch people of color. Between 1840 and the nineteen-twenties, mobs, vigilantes, and law officers, including the Texas Rangers, lynched some five hundred Mexicans and Mexican-Americans and killed thousands more, not only in Texas but also in territories that became the states of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. A San Francisco vigilance committee established in 1851 arrested, tried, and hanged people; it boasted a membership in the thousands. An L.A. vigilance committee targeted and lynched Chinese immigrants.\n\nThe U.S. Army operated as a police force, too. After the Civil War, the militia was organized into seven new departments of permanent standing armies: the Department of Dakota, the Department of the Platte, the Department of the Missouri, the Department of Texas, the Department of Arizona, the Department of California, and the Department of the Columbian. In the eighteen-seventies and eighties, the U.S. Army engaged in more than a thousand combat operations against Native peoples. In 1890, at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, following an attempt to disarm a Lakota settlement, a regiment of cavalrymen massacred hundreds of Lakota men, women, and children. Nearly a century later, in 1973, F.B.I. agents, SWAT teams, and federal troops and state marshals laid siege to Wounded Knee during a protest over police brutality and the failure to properly punish the torture and murder of an Oglala Sioux man named Raymond Yellow Thunder. They fired more than half a million rounds of ammunition and arrested more than a thousand people. Today, according to the C.D.C., Native Americans are more likely to be killed by the police than any other racial or ethnic group.\n\nModern American policing began in 1909, when August Vollmer became the chief of the police department in Berkeley, California. Vollmer refashioned American police into an American military. He'd served with the Eighth Army Corps in the Philippines in 1898. \"For years, ever since Spanish-American War days, I've studied military tactics and used them to good effect in rounding up crooks,\" he later explained. \"After all we're conducting a war, a war against the enemies of society.\" Who were those enemies? Mobsters, bootleggers, socialist agitators, strikers, union organizers, immigrants, and Black people.\n\nTo domestic policing, Vollmer and his peers adapted the kinds of tactics and weapons that had been deployed against Native Americans in the West and against colonized peoples in other parts of the world, including Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, as the sociologist Julian Go has demonstrated. Vollmer instituted a training model imitated all over the country, by police departments that were often led and staffed by other veterans of the United States wars of conquest and occupation. A \"police captain or lieutenant should occupy exactly the same position in the public mind as that of a captain or lieutenant in the United States army,\" Detroit's commissioner of police said. (Today's police officers are disproportionately veterans of U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, many suffering from post-traumatic stress. The Marshall Project, analyzing data from the Albuquerque police, found that officers who are veterans are more likely than their non-veteran counterparts to be involved in fatal shootings. In general, they are more likely to use force, and more likely to fire their guns.)\n\nVollmer-era police enforced a new kind of slave code: Jim Crow laws, which had been passed in the South beginning in the late eighteen-seventies and upheld by the Supreme Court in 1896. William G. Austin became Savannah's chief of police in 1907. Earlier, he had earned a Medal of Honor for his service in the U.S. Cavalry at Wounded Knee; he had also fought in the Spanish-American War. By 1916, African-American churches in the city were complaining to Savannah newspapers about the \"whole scale arrests of negroes because they are negroes-arrests that would not be made if they were white under similar circumstances.\" African-Americans also confronted Jim Crow policing in the Northern cities to which they increasingly fled. James Robinson, Philadelphia's chief of police beginning in 1912, had served in the Infantry during the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War. He based his force's training on manuals used by the U.S. Army at Leavenworth. Go reports that, in 1911, about eleven per cent of people arrested were African-American; under Robinson, that number rose to 14.6 per cent in 1917. By the nineteen-twenties, a quarter of those arrested were African-Americans, who, at the time, represented just 7.4 per cent of the population.\n\nProgressive Era, Vollmer-style policing criminalized Blackness, as the historian Khalil Gibran Muhammad argued in his 2010 book, \" The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America .\" Police patrolled Black neighborhoods and arrested Black people disproportionately; prosecutors indicted Black people disproportionately; juries found Black people guilty disproportionately; judges gave Black people disproportionately long sentences; and, then, after all this, social scientists, observing the number of Black people in jail, decided that, as a matter of biology, Black people were disproportionately inclined to criminality.\n\nMore recently, between the New Jim Crow and the criminalization of immigration and the imprisonment of immigrants in detention centers, this reality has only grown worse. \"By population, by per capita incarceration rates, and by expenditures, the United States exceeds all other nations in how many of its citizens, asylum seekers, and undocumented immigrants are under some form of criminal justice supervision,\" Muhammad writes in a new preface to his book. \"The number of African American and Latinx people in American jails and prisons today exceeds the entire populations of some African, Eastern European, and Caribbean countries.\"\n\nPolicing grew harsher in the Progressive Era, and, with the emergence of state-police forces, the number of police grew, too. With the rise of the automobile, some, like California's, began as \"highway patrols.\" Others, including the state police in Nevada, Colorado, and Oregon, began as the private paramilitaries of industrialists which employed the newest American immigrants: Hungarians, Italians, and Jews. Industrialists in Pennsylvania established the Iron and Coal Police to end strikes and bust unions, including the United Mine Workers; in 1905, three years after an anthracite-coal strike, the Pennsylvania State Police started operations. \"One State Policeman should be able to handle one hundred foreigners,\" its new chief said.\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol began in 1924, the year that Congress restricted immigration from southern Europe. At the insistence of Southern and Western agriculturalists, Congress exempted Mexicans from its new immigration quotas in order to allow migrant workers to enter the United States. The Border Patrol began as a relatively small outfit responsible for enforcing federal immigration law, and stopping smugglers, at all of the nation's borders. In the middle decades of the twentieth century, it grew to a national quasi-military focussed on policing the southern border in campaigns of mass arrest and forced deportation of Mexican immigrants, aided by local police like the notoriously brutal L.A.P.D., as the historian Kelly Lytle Hernández has chronicled. What became the Chicano movement began in Southern California, with Mexican immigrants' protests of the L.A.P.D. during the first half of the twentieth century, even as a growing film industry cranked out features about Klansmen hunting Black people, cowboys killing Indians, and police chasing Mexicans. More recently, you can find an updated version of this story in L.A. Noire, a video game set in 1947 and played from the perspective of a well-armed L.A.P.D. officer, who, driving along Sunset Boulevard, passes the crumbling, abandoned sets from D. W. Griffith's 1916 film \"Intolerance,\" imagined relics of an unforgiving age.\n\nTwo kinds of police appeared on mid-century American television. The good guys solved crime on prime-time police procedurals like \"Dragnet,\" starting in 1951, and \"Adam-12,\" beginning in 1968 (both featured the L.A.P.D.). The bad guys shocked America's conscience on the nightly news: Arkansas state troopers barring Black students from entering Little Rock Central High School, in 1957; Birmingham police clubbing and arresting some seven hundred Black children protesting segregation, in 1963; and Alabama state troopers beating voting-rights marchers at Selma, in 1965. These two faces of policing help explain how, in the nineteen-sixties, the more people protested police brutality, the more money governments gave to police departments.\n\nIn 1965, President Lyndon Johnson declared a \"war on crime,\" and asked Congress to pass the Law Enforcement Assistance Act, under which the federal government would supply local police with military-grade weapons, weapons that were being used in the war in Vietnam. During riots in Watts that summer, law enforcement killed thirty-one people and arrested more than four thousand; fighting the protesters, the head of the L.A.P.D. said, was \"very much like fighting the Viet Cong.\" Preparing for a Senate vote just days after the uprising ended, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee said, \"For some time, it has been my feeling that the task of law enforcement agencies is really not much different from military forces; namely, to deter crime before it occurs, just as our military objective is deterrence of aggression.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAs Elizabeth Hinton reported in \" From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime: The Making of Mass Incarceration in America ,\" the \"frontline soldiers\" in Johnson's war on crime-Vollmer-era policing all over again-spent a disproportionate amount of time patrolling Black neighborhoods and arresting Black people. Policymakers concluded from those differential arrest rates that Black people were prone to criminality, with the result that police spent even more of their time patrolling Black neighborhoods, which led to a still higher arrest rate. \"If we wish to rid this country of crime, if we wish to stop hacking at its branches only, we must cut its roots and drain its swampy breeding ground, the slum,\" Johnson told an audience of police policymakers in 1966. The next year, riots broke out in Newark and Detroit. \"We ain't rioting agains' all you whites,\" one Newark man told a reporter not long before being shot dead by police. \"We're riotin' agains' police brutality.\" In Detroit, police arrested more than seven thousand people.\n\nJohnson's Great Society essentially ended when he asked Congress to pass the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, which had the effect of diverting money from social programs to policing. This magazine called it \"a piece of demagoguery devised out of malevolence and enacted in hysteria.\" James Baldwin attributed its \"irresponsible ferocity\" to \"some pale, compelling nightmare-an overwhelming collection of private nightmares.\" The truth was darker, as the sociologist Stuart Schrader chronicled in his 2019 book, \" Badges Without Borders: How Global Counterinsurgency Transformed American Policing .\" During the Cold War, the Office of Public Safety at the U.S.A.I.D. provided assistance to the police in at least fifty-two countries, and training to officers from nearly eighty, for the purpose of counter-insurgency-the suppression of an anticipated revolution, that collection of private nightmares; as the O.P.S. reported, it contributed \"the international dimension to the Administration's War on Crime.\" Counter-insurgency boomeranged, and came back to the United States, as policing.\n\nIn 1968, Johnson's new crime bill established the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, within the Department of Justice, which, in the next decade and a half, disbursed federal funds to more than eighty thousand crime-control projects. Even funds intended for social projects-youth employment, for instance, along with other health, education, housing, and welfare programs-were distributed to police operations. With Richard Nixon, any elements of the Great Society that had survived the disastrous end of Johnson's Presidency were drastically cut, with an increased emphasis on policing, and prison-building. More Americans went to prison between 1965 and 1982 than between 1865 and 1964, Hinton reports. Under Ronald Reagan, still more social services were closed, or starved of funding until they died: mental hospitals, health centers, jobs programs, early-childhood education. By 2016, eighteen states were spending more on prisons than on colleges and universities. Activists who today call for defunding the police argue that, for decades, Americans have been defunding not only social services but, in many states, public education itself. The more frayed the social fabric, the more police have been deployed to trim the dangling threads.\n\nThe blueprint for law enforcement from Nixon to Reagan came from the Harvard political scientist James Q. Wilson between 1968, in his book \" Varieties of Police Behavior ,\" and 1982, in an essay in The Atlantic titled \"Broken Windows.\" On the one hand, Wilson believed that the police should shift from enforcing the law to maintaining order, by patrolling on foot, and doing what came to be called \"community policing.\" (Some of his recommendations were ignored: Wilson called for other professionals to handle what he termed the \"service functions\" of the police-\"first aid, rescuing cats, helping ladies, and the like\"-which is a reform people are asking for today.) On the other hand, Wilson called for police to arrest people for petty crimes, on the theory that they contributed to more serious crimes. Wilson's work informed programs like Detroit's STRESS (Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets), begun in 1971, in which Detroit police patrolled the city undercover, in disguises that included everything from a taxi-driver to a \"radical college professor,\" and killed so many young Black men that an organization of Black police officers demanded that the unit be disbanded. The campaign to end STRESS arguably marked the very beginnings of police abolitionism. STRESS defended its methods. \"We just don't walk up and shoot somebody,\" one commander said. \"We ask him to stop. If he doesn't, we shoot.\"\n\nFor decades, the war on crime was bipartisan, and had substantial support from the Congressional Black Caucus. \"Crime is a national-defense problem,\" Joe Biden said in the Senate, in 1982. \"You're in as much jeopardy in the streets as you are from a Soviet missile.\" Biden and other Democrats in the Senate introduced legislation that resulted in the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. A decade later, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Biden helped draft the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, whose provisions included mandatory sentencing. In May, 1991, two months after the Rodney King beating, Biden introduced the Police Officers' Bill of Rights, which provided protections for police under investigation. The N.R.A. first endorsed a Presidential candidate, Reagan, in 1980; the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation's largest police union, first endorsed a Presidential candidate, George H. W. Bush, in 1988. In 1996, it endorsed Bill Clinton.\n\nPartly because of Biden's record of championing law enforcement, the National Association of Police Organizations endorsed the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012. In 2014, after police in Ferguson, Missouri, shot Michael Brown, the Obama Administration established a task force on policing in the twenty-first century. Its report argued that police had become warriors when what they really should be is guardians. Most of its recommendations were never implemented.\n\nIn 2016, the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Donald Trump, saying that \"our members believe he will make America safe again.\" Police unions are lining up behind Trump again this year. \"We will never abolish our police or our great Second Amendment,\" Trump said at Mt. Rushmore , on the occasion of the Fourth of July. \"We will not be intimidated by bad, evil people.\"\n\nTrump is not the king; the law is king. The police are not the king's men; they are public servants. And, no matter how desperately Trump would like to make it so, policing really isn't a partisan issue. Out of the stillness of the shutdown, the voices of protest have roared like summer thunder. An overwhelming majority of Americans, of both parties, support major reforms in American policing. And a whole lot of police, defying their unions, also support those reforms.\n\nThose changes won't address plenty of bigger crises, not least because the problem of policing can't be solved without addressing the problem of guns. But this much is clear: the polis has changed, and the police will have to change, too. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this piece misrepresented the number of Americans between the ages of fifteen and thirty-four who were treated as a result of police-inflicted injuries in emergency rooms.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Local Elected Officials Who Are Tanking Police Reform\n\nAfter Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd in May of 2020, police reform on the federal level seemed more possible than it had ever been. Kamala Harris, in the run-up to being chosen as Joe Biden's running mate, made police reform a specific piece of her agenda, despite her mixed record on the issue as a prosecutor. Harris went on The View and talked about \"reimagining how we do public safety in America.\" At a Democratic fundraiser that summer, she said, \"We need to have serious police reform. ... Joe and I are very clear about this.\"\n\nInvigorated-or panicked-Congress attempted bipartisan reform. The goal was to come to some sort of agreement over a host of federal reforms, including changes to acceptable use-of-force standards, tying federal funding to local reforms, and fixing qualified immunity , which is the legal doctrine that prevents people injured or killed by police conduct from pursuing successful lawsuits. The Republican Senator from South Carolina, Tim Scott , voiced his support for reform and promised to work with Democratic Sen. Corey Booker to hash out the exact details.\n\nThose talks crumbled last week, leaving people who were counting on some type of reform-at least to justify the work of thousands of advocates and to legitimize the suffering of millions more who come into contact with law enforcement every year. Both the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Fraternal Order of Police issued a joint statement expressing their disappointment that talks had flopped. The statement also clarified, \"Despite some media reports, at no point did any legislative draft propose 'defunding the police,'\" which spoke to Scott's misleading claims that proposals which made federal funding dependent on police reform amounted to \" defunding the police .\" (Despite Scott's claim, federal funding only accounts for less than a quarter of police budgets.)\n\nThe push to point fingers led us to one highly influential group: the sheriffs. Only about 1 in 4 sworn officers work for sheriffs departments, so while their mark on politics feels outsize, it is also not insurmountable.\n\nDuring the bipartisan talks over the summer, Scott was clear that he would not support any legislation that was not backed by the National Sheriffs' Association , the largest group representing all U.S. sheriffs, which elected new leadership this year that included one sheriff who was present at the Capitol on January 6. (The sheriff, Chris West of Oklahoma , says he did not enter the Capitol building.) Both Scott and Sen. Lindsey Graham were adamant that sheriffs be included in all reform talks.\n\nThe National Sheriffs' Association purports to represent all of the elected sheriffs in the U.S., which is over 3,000, 90% of whom are white men . This year, the NSA \"sheriff of the year\" was South Carolina Sheriff Leon Lott , who has been in office since 1997. The NSA gained more power under Donald Trump, whose then- Attorney General Jeff Sessions received an award from the NSA and called sheriffs \"Anglo Saxon heritage of law enforcement.\" Lott, for his part, called Black Lives Matters protestors \"violent gangs, outside agitators and others who planned to burn down Columbia police headquarters,\" and focused his energy on arresting them. He is also, apparently, one of the most influential politicians in South Carolina, in part because of his appearances on Live PD .\n\nSo why did the sheriffs object to the reform bill? The main sticking point for the NSA was a provision that would make sheriffs, who are elected, liable for the misbehavior of their deputies. Sheriffs immediately began to object to Sen. Booker's provisions and partnered with the National Association of Police Organizations (a coalition of police unions) to issue a fear-mongering letter outlining the group's \" grave concerns ,\" an opinion echoed by Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the NSA, who is not an elected sheriff.\n\nEven the Fraternal Order of Police, a group not known for favoring progressive reforms, felt that the sheriffs were being unduly difficult, and its executive director told the New York Times , that the NSA \"is often upset, and sometimes it is difficult to ascertain the exact reason for it.\"\n\nThis is no surprise. In general, sheriffs are more politically conservative and less likely to support policing reforms. Research by Michael Zoroob, a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Boston Area Research Initiative, analyzed sheriff elections from 1958 through 2018 and found that not only did sheriffs serve longer terms, but they also remained in office even when the political trends of their county changed.\n\nOne of the reasons sheriffs persist in office despite changing attitudes is that they create effective lobbying groups in the form of state sheriff associations , which usually include every elected sheriff in a state. While some sheriffs may be Democrat and more liberal, state sheriff associations skew much more right-wing and are often dominated by the sheriffs in more conservative, more rural counties. In this way, even when a state is dominated by Democrats-Virginia, Washington, and Maryland, for example-the sheriff association remains a strong voice for the right.\n\nTake, for example, several statements from local sheriffs after the federal talks failed. The South Carolina Sheriffs' Association, Sen. Scott's home state, issued its own statement glorifying Scott's take on \"defund.\" \"Senator Scott maintained an open mind throughout the process,\" the September 22 letter read in part. The president of the South Carolina Sheriffs' Association, York County Sheriff Kevin Tolson , issued his own letter , arguing that some of the proposed provisions in the federal legislation were \"de facto defunding the police,\" echoing Sen. Scott and contradicting the national police associations. (It's worth nothing that York County is around 75 percent white and Sheriff Tolson's last claim to fame was when he made a passionate Facebook post - now deleted - condemning protestors who kneeled during the national anthem.)\n\nIn light of the failures of federal reforms, many have pointed to successful state reforms. But here, too, sheriffs present substantial challenges to change.\n\nIn Washington, for example, the legislature passed a slate of policing reforms that became state law this month, including a law that requires de-escalation as well as probable cause before engaging in a chase of a fleeing person. Sheriffs across the state objected immediately and loudly, blaming the reforms for increased crime and calling out that the laws had \" handcuffed \" law enforcement.\n\nThe Washington State Sheriffs' Association demanded clarification from the governor on the new laws, and the president, Sheriff Tom Jones, insisted the new laws would make people less safe. Another sheriff, Clark County Sheriff Chuck Atkins, issued a public statement warning his constituents that his office would be unable to respond to all calls for service. Lewis County Sheriff Rob Snaza complained to a community group, \"I'm telling you this, I'm common sense, I'm a meat and potato guy. This doesn't have the smell test. It smells like BS.\"\n\nSheriffs in Oklahoma , Virginia , and Florida have also opposed reforms in recent years through extensive lobbying. These groups have used their collective power and influence to argue against criminal system reforms and have generated headlines and research to support measures like bills that would punish immigrants and protestors .\n\nWhat can politicians and activists do to limit the power of sheriffs to block police reform? One way is to be clear with voters and decision-makers that sheriffs are not above accountability through legislative change in addition to popular elections. While sheriffs are written into the state constitution in over 33 states and created by state statute in 13 states, there is no legal reason why sheriffs are not subject to legislative reforms the same way police agencies are. Right now, sheriffs are barely in the line of sight. Biden's platform does not even mention sheriffs; nor do most major proposals for criminal system reform. There is no reason to listen to sheriffs when they demand exceptions; they are not exceptional.\n\nEven the National Sheriffs' Association acknowledges that the \"oath of office\" does not confer \"extraordinary powers or duties.\" To the extent sheriffs are elected, it is their political stance and partisanship that dictates their reluctance to reform, not the office itself.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What Do We Really Know About The National Sheriffs Association?\n\nThis week, the National Sheriffs Association held their Winter Conference in Washington, D.C. The meeting is held in the nation's capital every year, but this year a new event was added to the agenda: a \" Hill Day ,\"in which the NSA arranged meetings between county sheriffs and their congressional representatives to discuss issues that are \"meaningful to Sheriffs,\" ranging from policing issues to medical care.\n\nSince the summer of 2020, when the nation erupted into protest over police violence, police unions have been hard at work using their immense political power to thwart reform efforts. While police unions generally operate locally, there are state-wide and nation-wide organizations that purport to represent the interests of various law enforcement groups: police chiefs, police captains, and sheriffs. Sheriffs, in particular, have displayed immense resistance to efforts to change policing. Yet the national association that ostensibly represents their interests, and lobbies Congress on their behalf, remains under-examined and under-studied.\n\nLast fall, for example, after every major national law enforcement lobbying group agreed to a set of modest, bipartisan policing reforms hashed out by Sens. Tim Scott and Corey Booker, the sheriffs refused to budge from their hardline position, especially when it came to reforming qualified immunity , the legal doctrine that makes it near-impossible to hold rogue and criminal law enforcement officers liable in civil suits.\n\nSince then, sheriffs, under the leadership of the National Sheriffs Association (NSA), have gone on the warpath, pushing false narratives about a \"war on cops\" and whipping up unsubstantiated panic about increasing crime. In one instance, Louisiana Sheriff Vernon Stanforth, the President of the NSA, went on a local news station to call for federal support in arresting alleged shoplifters because they were \"terrorizing their communities.\" His request was backed up by a general NSA call for an action by the Biden administration on retail theft (which isn't a federal crime).\n\nThe next day, Executive Director and CEO of the NSA Jonathan Thompson - who is a paid employee of the organization and not an elected sheriff -  went on Fox News to complain about the NFL's discretionary donations to groups engaged in criminal system reform through the \"Inspire Change\" initiative.  Thompson topped his complaints with a veiled threat that players should \"spend one night in a cruiser or a jail to see the horrendous effects of runaway crime.\"\n\nThe sheriffs even went so far as to slam a leaked draft executive order , purportedly from the Biden administration, that appeared to address a variety of federal law enforcement reforms and provide additional funding for certain programs. (Biden seems to be walking back this plan based on recent meetings with law enforcement.)\n\nHow did the sheriffs come to be such a unified front against policing reform? Through the work of the National Sheriffs Association , a big-tent organization that nominally represents the interests of county sheriffs. Part of that representation requires the creation and reiteration of a mythology about sheriffs that serves to secure their place in the American pantheon of law enforcement organizations. This objective is even written into their \"constitutional charter.\" They mean it. When the county commissioners of Loudoun County, Virginia , considered reducing the role of the county sheriff by creating a police force (that would be under the control of the mostly Democrat county government), the NSA was there to argue forcefully against it. They claimed that sheriffs were more cost-efficient and better at patrol and policing than county-run police forces, and called the county government \" political hacks .\"\n\nWhile the NSA claims to be nonpartisan, its leadership has proven to be less so, with the most recent slate of leaders leaning further to the right than past leadership. At least one member of the Executive Committee - Sheriff Chris West of Oklahoma -  was at  the Capitol on Jan. 6. At least three others are members of Protect America Now, a far-right sheriff's organization, or the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, a group that believes sheriffs are the ultimate arbiters of the constitution. The current chair of the Government Affairs Committee is Collin County, Texas, Sheriff Jim Skinner, who was responsible for the high-profile jail death of Marvin Scott III, whom deputies killed by restraining him, placing a hood over his head, and dousing him with pepper spray. As part of the committee, Skinner is tasked with developing the NSA's policy positions on law enforcement and homeland security in addition to representing the Association before Congress and the White House. The NSA has also consistently lobbied in favor of civil asset forfeiture , which, despite bipartisan opposition, remains the law in Texas.\n\nThese political affiliations have only become more tangled with the rise of the constitutional sheriffs movement. The NSA has yet to disavow the growing number of sheriffs who have refused to enforce vaccination orders, expressed anti-government rhetoric, or spread disinformation about election fraud. In fact, spokesperson for the NSA praised Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb , who formed a far-right sheriffs group and has ties to Donald Trump and Michael Flynn, the ex-government official who we now know was pushing a plan for the military to seize voting machines to overturn the 2020 election. The spokesperson praised Lamb as a \"unicorn\" during an interview in October of 2021, adding that Lamb was simply standing up for the office of the sheriff.\n\nWhile the NSA officially disavows connections between corporate sponsors and their policies, the degree of corporate funding is shadowy and belies their alleged neutrality. The Association is a 501(c)(4) organization, which is not required to disclose its donor and lobbying expenditures publicly. What we do know is that the NSA manages to raise in the neighborhood of $8 million in \"dark money\" every year. (A spokesperson from the NSA says the money is a mix  of member dues, government grants, and corporate sponsorships). The available public information about funding indicates that the NSA is beholden to the corporations that have built the prison industrial complex and produce billions of dollars in profits off the backs of people in cages. Such for-profit industries, which include telecommunications companies like Verizon , GTL, PayTel and correctional health care companies as well as more anodyne corporations like Airbnb and The Home Depot can purchase access to sheriffs. For top donors their purchase includes a \"reception\" with NSA leadership as well as a \"Private Dinner with Members of NSA's Executive Committee and Headquarters' Leadership.\"\n\nThese sponsorships are really the tip of the iceberg of the many troubling alliances that betray the nominally nonpartisan spirit of the NSA.\n\nFor example, this year, ex-police officer named Matthew Griffin, who wrote a book about mental health for law enforcement, gave the keynote speech and was made an \"honorary sheriff.\" Griffin, who has never been a sheriff, served as a police officer in New Hampshire, but left after he was added not once, but twice, to a statewide list of officers who committed misconduct. According to one news source, Griffin at one point claimed to be a \" reserve officer \" for an unincorporated New Hampshire town and worked as a police trainer. His speech was sponsored by Axon , the company that makes body cameras and Tasers. And, according to a 2021 Washington Post article, Griffin also serves as a police trainer .\n\nThere is further evidence that the NSA courts corporate sponsorship in exchange for sheriff sponsorship.  In 2016, the NSA took $350,000 from Purdue Pharma, which it used to distribute naloxone overdose kits and train deputies to reverse overdoses. The Association also took an undisclosed amount from Alkermes , Inc, the manufacturer of Vivitrol , an overdose prevention drug, to \"raise awareness among law enforcement of the alarming opioid epidemic.\" ( ProPublica reported that Alkermes has heavily marketed Vivitrol to law enforcement and judges because, while less effective than methadone and Suboxone, the shot blocks the ability of people to feel the pleasurable high of opiates.) The NSA also spent over $500,000 to air televisions ads featuring sheriffs voicing their opposition to imported prescription drugs , which was the subject of a bipartisan proposal to bring down the costs of medicines in the U.S.\n\nIn the past few years, the NSA has pushed surveillance technology by channeling federal grants and promoting private industry, making them a major player in the public-private partnerships that have promoted surveillance cameras and AI-driven technologies. One such push is eye scanning technology from a corporation called B12 Technologies that has been implemented in some jails with federal funding . Another includes a partnership with Clearview AI , a corporation that markets f acial recognition technology used by law enforcement, which has increased its contracts under the Biden administration.\n\nA final plank of the NSA's political strategy involves the filing of numerous amicus briefs in various cases across the country in which they take troubling positions that oppose the Constitutional rights of individuals. Many in the public are already familiar with the entanglement between the National Rifle Association and sheriffs; the NSA has joined other gun organizations in amici that argue in favor of invalidating gun restrictions. In 2015, the NSA filed a brief opposing DACA alongside FAIR and Center for Immigration Studies, another Tanton group. The NSA has also filed amici briefs supporting the seizure of hotel guests lists without a warrant , qualified immunity in a case where sheriffs' deputies killed a suspect during arrest while city officers watched, warrantless searches even where there has been an error on the part of law enforcement, and application of a negligence standards for liability in jail deaths.\n\nBut the troubling fusion of private industry money, lobbying activities, and mass surveillance makes the public comments and inaction of the NSA more suspect when considering the overall landscape for police reform. It's true that the structure of the NSA is legal and one used by groups on the left and the right. But, communities have a right to know about the corporate (and individual) funders who profit from additional policing, especially organizations that appear to tolerate wrong-doing. The NSA should be seen as part of the network of dark money groups who are influencing legislation and grants rather than a nonpartisan general interest group.\n\nAnother path is possible. In California , district attorneys have split away from the state prosecutor's association because of its retrograde positions, which is a first step towards disentangling dark money, corporate interests, and an industry that has profited from caging people. It's time for sheriffs to do the same.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Sheriffs Helped Lead This Insurrection\n\nOn Jan. 6, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb made a promise. Delivering a speech in Phoenix during the ongoing mob attack on the nation's Capitol, Lamb accused former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton of unnamed crimes and repeated President Donald Trump's false claims about election fraud. \"Now I'm limited to what I can do as the sheriff, but if you live in Pinal County, I assure you I can fight for your freedom,\" he said before exhorting his followers to \"be vigilant\" and to \"fight for the Constitution, freedom, and the American way of life.\" (The video has since been deleted from social media.)\n\nIn the past week, it's become clear that many members of law enforcement from across the country participated in the siege on the Capitol. That includes former and current sheriffs and their deputies. Ex-Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway was at the Trump rally but says he didn't march to the Capitol. He described the crowd as \"a cross between tailgating at a football game and a NASCAR race-families, dogs, children. Everyone being nice. I mean, it was like a family reunion without some of the hatefulness you can find at family reunions. It was a very good crowd.\"\n\nAt least one current sheriff admits he was at the riot: Sheriff Chris West of Canadian County, Oklahoma, says he marched toward the Capitol building but did not enter. But long before Jan. 6, sheriffs have been helping to lay the groundwork for violence by the far-right movement. As political leaders in their communities, they have been sowing dissent at home, encouraging their own armed militias to prepare themselves to take back the government just as Lamb suggested.\n\nNinety percent of American sheriffs are white men, and in recent years they've become strongly affiliated with white supremacist groups. Across the country, sheriffs have declared that they will not enforce laws they deem \"unconstitutional,\" like COVID-19 public health orders or gun laws limiting weapons possession and permits. Their influence has only grown since the pandemic began, as mask wearing became affiliated with progressive liberals and a bare face was a sign of Trump support. Trump has always had an affinity with sheriffs. He met with more sheriffs at the White House than any other president and pardoned ex-Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of contempt of court for failing to abide by a nondiscrimination order, calling him an \"American patriot.\"\n\nSheriffs have also played a key role in nurturing extrajudicial militia movements, joined by a united interest in gun rights and masculine grievance. This \" gun populism ,\" as associate professor Jennifer Carlson calls it, has been embraced by far-right Trump supporters, who have dubbed themselves \"patriots.\" Their adherents tend to be middle-class white men who support law enforcement while, at the same time, promoting a militaristic view of the world that supports violence and rejects professional expertise. The sheriff, long a staple of \"good old boy\" culture, the lawman who can claim democratic authority, is a natural ally.\n\nThis alliance was on display in the Michigan protests last spring, after armed protesters took over the Michigan capitol building during the legislative session. Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf -who would later speak in support of the militia members arrested for planning to kidnap Michigan's Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer-addressed a crowd at a May rally in Grand Rapids. He argued that the federal government's only job was \"protecting our borders\" before praising militia members for being loyal adherents to an ancient code of duty: \"Militia duty goes way back, hundreds of years before the constitution. When kings were out there, they made the farmers carry a sword.\"\n\nAdherents to the \" constitutional sheriff \" movement, of which Lamb and Leaf are members alongside Arpaio, argue that sheriffs have an obligation to protect their constituents from unconstitutional laws. Most constitutional sheriffs formally disavow racism and even use Rosa Parks as an inspirational talking point. Leaf, for example, said at the May rally (which took place at Rosa Parks Circle) that a true constitutional sheriff would not have arrested Parks because the law preventing her from sitting where she pleased was not constitutional.\n\nBut the constitutional sheriff movement has explicitly white supremacist roots. When the Supreme Court held in Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation was unconstitutional, county sheriffs were among the Southern officials who defied the court's decision. They claimed that, in fact, desegregation was unconstitutional and invoked a legal theory called \" interposition ,\" which argues that states can independently decide federal laws are unconstitutional and nullify them.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that interposition was not a valid legal theory in 1958, but that hasn't stopped the constitutional sheriff movement from using it as a tool to delegitimize state and federal governments. Sheriff Richard Mack, who founded the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association-the largest constitutional sheriff organization with a membership of some 400 sheriffs-revived the idea of interposition , telling NPR , \"Sheriffs standing for freedom have the responsibility to interpose ... wherever anybody is trying to diminish or violate the individual rights of our counties.\"\n\nThis is precisely what the rioters who stormed D.C. wanted. Yes, they were fueled by misinformation. But they also felt justified to commit violent acts in public, bare-faced and on camera, because, in their eyes, the laws they were breaking weren't real. Two days after the riot, the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association issued a statement exonerating Trump and pushing the debunked claim that antifa (the shorthand for militant anti-fascist activists) was responsible for the violence.\n\nSheriffs who attended the pre-riot rally, like Lamb and West, are unlikely to face consequences where they live. One local activist started an online petition to remove West from office for his participation in the riot; that effort has been met with a very popular counterpetition in support of West. (West has also formed a 500-person \"sheriff's posse ,\" with many members citing weapons experience.)\n\nLamb, despite facing a state investigation for corruption, has remained popular in his county. He also has a wide following on social media; sells T-shirts emblazoned with his face, guns, and the text of the Constitution; and was a commentator on Live PD .\n\nThe constitutional sheriff's movement stands to grow even without Trump as president. Trump supporters are planning to further their political goals through the election of like-minded sheriffs. Just last week, one Michigan militia member posted this message in a Facebook group: \"While we are speaking about local offices we also need Sherriffs Elected in each county who understand the constitution & that they have the power within the County they serve Not the Federal Government.\"\n\nDuring the Grand Rapids rally in May, Leaf pointed to the Barry County sheriff badge on his chest, saying, \"This isn't really a badge, but a shield. It represents the knights protecting their kingdom.\" Listeners cheered. Perhaps their kingdom finally felt within reach.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

As John Oliver pointed out on the latest episode of Last Week Tonight , some sheriffs use their power for good, like the one who spoke out in favor of bail reform in Harris County, Texas, so that people arrested for misdemeanor offenses don't get stuck in jail just because they can't afford to pay. Still, other sheriffs take advantage of their positions, like the sheriff accused of exploiting an old law to skimp on prisoners' food and pocket the remainder of the budget in Etowah County, Alabama.\n\nRemoving a sheriff in between elections is \"almost impossible,\" as Oliver explains, and most of them run unopposed. The misbehaving sheriffs in Last Week Tonight 's segment range from garden-variety villains who value profits over people to one oddball whose election ad includes a photo of himself in blackface.

      "text": "Heritage of Hate\n\nIn remarks delivered to the National Sheriffs' Association on Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions offered some bizarre-sounding praise for \"Anglo-American\" law enforcement traditions. \"Since our founding, the independently elected sheriff has been the people's protector, who keeps law enforcement close to and accountable to people through the elected process,\" Sessions said . \"The office of sheriff is a critical part of the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement. We must never erode this historic office.\"\n\nIf Sessions did not have one of the nation's deepest résumés of racial prejudice, one could perhaps write off this episode as an awkward rhetorical commendation from the nation's top lawman, which his spokesperson has since defended as a mere description of the \" shared legal heritage between England and America .\" Given Sessions' appalling personal legacy and the special place that sheriffs' offices hold in the hearts of right-wing extremists, though, Sessions' most recent dog whistle was simply too loud to ignore. It also serves as yet another reminder that Americans who value civil rights should continue to demand his removal every single day.\n\nIt's worth remembering that countless black Americans were lynched, captured, beaten, hosed, tortured, and terrorized with either the overt support or the deliberate indifference of \"the people's protectors\" over the course of American history. During most of the time \"since our founding,\" local law enforcement has played the role of an oppressive force against black Americans, rather than a protective one. One oft-cited study by sociologist Arthur Raper, for example, estimated that \"at least one-half\" of U.S. lynchings after 1929 were \"carried out with police officers participating, and that in nine-tenths of the others, the officers either condone[d] or wink[ed] at the mob action.\" Elected local law enforcement officials like Birmingham, Alabama, Commissioner of Public Safety Bull Connor were similarly celebrated in their time by offering \" protection \" to black Americans in the form of fire hoses, police dogs, and billy clubs. To many people of color, who are still disproportionately targeted by local law enforcement today-even for minor crimes like jaywalking and marijuana possession -the disturbing history of institutional racism in the \"historic office\" of sheriff may resonate to this day.\n\nTo today's white nationalists, however, Sessions' full-throated embrace of \"the Anglo-American heritage\" of local sheriffs would mean something else entirely. For decades, far-right extremists have seized upon the mantle of \" posse comitatus \"-a legal doctrine providing for substantial deference and authority to county sheriffs-as a basis for rejecting the federal government's authority to enforce civil rights laws . The notion that sheriffs reign supreme over federal law enforcement officers is also a central claim of self-styled \"sovereign citizens\"-right-wing anarchists who \" recognize the local sheriff's department as the only legitimate government official .\" With this context in mind, when Cliven Bundy takes the podium to celebrate sheriffs who have been elected by \"we the sovereign people of the county\" and proclaims their supremacy over federal law enforcement officials, he and Jeff Sessions are speaking to the same audience in the same language.\n\nSessions' barely concealed hat tip to the right-wing underground, of course, does not come in anything even resembling isolation. Throughout his career, Sessions' political stances have turned almost uniformly on whether proposed government action will maintain or improve the status of white Americans at the expense of people of color. He's propelled these stances to new heights since taking over the top law enforcement position in the land. For example, Sessions has ardently supported states' rights resistance to federal \"overreach\" like the Voting Rights Act-a \" piece of intrusive legislation ,\" in his estimation-while championing federal supremacy over state policies aimed at protecting immigrants or liberalizing drug prohibition . Similarly, while Sessions has made clear that no amount of police misconduct can be considered substantial enough to justify a federal investigation, when black civil rights organizers tried to register voters in his backyard, no federal case-no matter how flimsy-could be considered too small .\n\nIn other words: Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III's central political philosophy is not federalism , or limited government , or any other respectable worldview traditionally associated with conservatives. Instead, from speaking wistfully about George Wallace , to reportedly condemning white civil rights lawyers as \" a disgrace to [their] race ,\" to joking about supporting the KKK \" until [he] learned they smoked pot ,\" Sessions espouses a political theory that can most accurately be described as \"racism.\" His celebration of \"the Anglo-American heritage\" of the American sheriff-a racially loaded overture to which he could not and should not have been ignorant-is no different. Instead, it's yet another reminder that Jeff Sessions is hideously unfit to oversee the Department of Justice and that the best thing that could happen to civil rights in America would be for him to resign.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Ex-Sheriff Joe Arpaio Wants to Bring Back His Brutal Tent City\n\nOne of the most notoriously racist sheriffs in recent American history wants his job back. Joe Arpaio, who served six terms as sheriff of Arizona's Maricopa County before losing the office in 2016, announced on Sunday that he would run again for his old position in 2020.\n\nIn 2017, Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for violating a 2011 court injunction blocking his discriminatory law enforcement stops of Hispanics in Maricopa County, the fourth-largest county in the country. Before he could be sentenced, President Donald Trump issued a controversial pardon of Arpaio, who was one of the first Republicans in the country to endorse Trump's presidential candidacy . As Mark Joseph Stern wrote at the time Trump was considering the pardon, the clemency was a potent symbol of Trump finding common cause with white nationalists:\n\nDuring his 24-year tenure as sheriff, Arpaio proudly strove to implement white nationalism through a brutal assault on Maricopa County's Latino population. His barbaric tactics included extreme racial profiling and sadistic punishments that involved the torture, humiliation, and degradation of Latino inmates. Courts repeatedly found that Arpaio violated the United States Constitution, but the sheriff often ignored their efforts to rein him in. There are few more potent symbols of mainstream white nationalism than Arpaio.\n\nFollowing his pardon, Arpaio ran in the 2018 Republican Senate primary in Arizona to try to replace Jeff Flake. He finished third with under 18 percent of the vote.\n\nIn his campaign announcement on Sunday, Arpaio promised to bring back one of his cruelest policies, pledging to revive his infamous \"tent city\" jail . Democratic Sheriff Paul Penzone, who defeated Arpaio in 2016, closed down that system shortly after taking office. Since then, the Trump administration has mainstreamed some of Arpaio's most horrifying tactics, including the wide usage of outdoor tent cities to detain migrants. Now that Arpaio is vying for control of his old jail again, it's worth revisiting a few of the atrocities he oversaw.\n\n• Nine years before New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got into hot water for describing Trump's tent detention facilities for migrants as concentration camps, Arpaio bragged that his own tent city jail facility for \"illegals\" was an effective \"concentration camp.\"\n\n• He often boasted about the brutal 120-degree heat that prisoners in his tent city-many of whom had not yet been convicted-were made to endure. The temperature in those tents could reportedly reach 145 degrees .\n\n• He aired live webcams of prisoners, including one of the toilet in a woman's facility, before the courts shut them down.\n\n• He claimed to investigate President Barack Obama's birth certificate, and as recently as last year claimed there was \"no doubt\" it was a \"phony.\"\n\n• He knowingly and illegally detained at least 171 individuals after a 2011 injunction barred his discriminatory detention practices, bragging that he would \"never give in to control by the federal government.\"\n\n• Between 2004 and 2008, his jail was sued more than five times as much the county jails of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Houston combined.\n\n• His office's physically brutal tactics -such as using stun guns on a prisoner already strapped to a restraint chair-led to multiple deaths in his custody. This led to multimillion-dollar settlements for the family of prisoners were who were killed due to the brutality of those in his office. As the New Yorker reported , one $8.25 million settlement came \"after the discovery of a surveillance video that showed fourteen guards beating, shocking, and suffocating the prisoner, and after the sheriff's office was accused of discarding evidence, including the crushed larynx of the deceased.\"\n\n• Arpaio's prisoners were allegedly punished with solitary confinement for being unable to speak English, referred to by jail staff as \"wetbacks,\" \"Mexican bitches,\" and \"stupid Mexicans,\" deprived of food and medical care, and physically tortured in exceedingly hot solitary confinement cells that offered certain inmates increased risk of heat-related illness.\n\n• While Arpaio's war on the Hispanic population of Maricopa County was ongoing, he cost the county tens of millions of dollars in court settlements and legal fees, and his office failed to resolve investigations of hundreds of sexual assault cases including at least 32 child abuse cases .\n\nTrump has supercharged Arpaio's tent city practices at the federal level. At least seven children, meanwhile, have died in immigration custody in the last year after a period of ten years in which no such deaths occurred. Border detention centers have also become infamous for extreme temperatures, and federal courts have ruled that children in federal detention were being unlawfully denied access to food, water and basic hygiene. Federal officials may not boast about these conditions like Arpaio did, but Trump has expressed admiration for the sheriff's approach. In pardoning Arpaio, Trump praised the sheriff's \"50 years of admirable service to our nation\" and \"life's work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration.\"\n\nDespite his powerful ally in the White House, Arpaio faces a steep road to winning the office back. He will be 92 years old by the time the next sheriff's term ends, the Democratic incumbent beat him by more than 10 percentage points in 2016, and he already has at least one credible challenger -his former chief deputy, Jerry Sheridan-in the Republican primary. It's unclear if Arpaio will have a presidential endorsement, but his dehumanizing tactics have clearly been an inspiration to this president and his administration. Arpaio said it best when he formally endorsed Trump's campaign in January 2016: \"Everything I believe in, he's doing and he's going to do it when he becomes president.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "America's Worst Sheriff Is Gone\n\nMaricopa County Sheriff's Office\n\nIn the 24 years that Joe Arpaio led the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, he gleefully degraded prisoners, promoted racist and hate-filled rhetoric, and ultimately became a caricature of the failed tough-on-crime approach to policing. Arpaio singled out immigrants for particularly aggressive treatment. With no real justification, he raided businesses to arrest undocumented people and presided over blatant racial profiling of Latinos. He also violated court orders telling him to stop, leading to a criminal contempt charge . His fanatical obsession with immigration cost Phoenix millions of dollars, as spending on immigration raids gobbled up the department's resources. Huge overtime spending on immigration enforcement led to a budget crisis, and legal fees for lawsuits about his policies cost taxpayers $142 million.\n\nArpaio's reign as the most infamous sheriff in America finally ended in November, when Democrat Paul Penzone defeated him by 200,000 votes. Penzone, 49, served in the Phoenix Police Department for 21 years, moving up from the ranks of officer to detective to sergeant and later working at a nonprofit fighting child abuse. While Arpaio was bombastic and provocative, Penzone is strait-laced, even-tempered, and cautious. Between the two sheriffs, \"It's like night and day,\" said Alfredo Gutierrez, a former majority leader in the state senate and longtime Arpaio critic.\n\nPenzone has promised to change the office's single-minded focus on immigration enforcement to instead promote responsive and effective policing. At the height of Arpaio's immigration detention machine, patrol cars were late to the most serious 911 calls two-thirds of the time, and some of the most serious crimes went unsolved. \"We know there were hundreds of cases of crimes against children that weren't investigated because the resources weren't there-they were allocated to immigration,\" Penzone told me, saying the misguided policies inspired him to run for election. \"It has undermined safety for this community.\"\n\nThe new sheriff also attacked Arpaio's immigrant raids as \"targeting people for the color of their skin.\" And he has labeled as \"not only reckless but unsafe\" Arpaio's decision to \"send a high volume of armed deputies to secure a business\" to locate \"a small group of individuals who may have committed immigration violations.\"\n\nJoel Robbins, a Phoenix attorney who filed a series of civil rights lawsuits against Arpaio, says he's encouraged by what he's seen from Penzone so far. \"With Arpaio, it was almost as if he was selling a brand: 'I'm the toughest sheriff in America,' \" Robbins said. \"I think Penzone is more of a professional. He cares more about doing his job than his reputation.\"\n\nThere are still significant questions, though, about far the new sheriff is willing to go in breaking Arpaio's detention machine.\n\nPenzone announced on Feb. 17 that he would refuse detainer requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Maricopa County jail, ending a policy of keeping undocumented immigrants locked up without probable cause beyond their court-ordered release dates and delivering them to federal agents. \"We are no longer the office willing to defy the Constitution at the expense of our taxpayer dollars, our resources, or public safety,\" Penzone told reporters. This was a significant change in policy: A 2013 study found that federal immigration authorities detained more people from the Maricopa jail than any such institution in the country.\n\nBut just one week after his forceful pronouncements, Penzone changed course. On Friday, he said officers would hand undocumented immigrants directly to ICE agents while they're still inside the jail, although he maintained that he won't hold them past their release dates. Penzone told a local TV station his decision came after \"the public flooded his office with angry comments\" about ending cooperation with ICE.\n\nIn an email, Penzone's spokesperson argued that the latest policy change was less a flip-flop than a \"new procedure\" and noted that \"it is completely ICE's responsibility to take custody of their immigrant detainees. ... We release when the court orders.\"\n\nThat statement obscures Penzone's own agency: From one week to the next, he went from refusing to transfer undocumented inmates to ICE agents within the facility to allowing such transfers.\n\nOutside of the immigration context, Penzone appears to be headed in the right direction in reversing the worst excesses of Arpaio's reign. Arpaio made a name for himself by embracing right-wing conspiracy theories, going so far as creating a \"cold case posse\"-a group of volunteer deputies-to investigate Barack Obama's birth certificate, among other nontraditional inquiries. Penzone shut down the Obama birth certificate investigation in January.\n\nArpaio also created a \"tent city\" in his Phoenix-area jail, housing inmates in an outdoor complex of Korean War-era military tents during 120-degree Arizona summers. Inmates at the jail are clothed in pink underwear-\"Why give them a color they like?\" Arpaio said in a 2014 interview -and sent to clean up public areas in literal chain gangs . He seemed to take pleasure in making life as intolerable as possible for the people in his jail, once bragging that \"it costs more to feed the dogs than it does the inmates.\"\n\nIn his first weeks in office, Penzone established a civilian advisory panel to recommend changes at the jail. He added a Spanish-language form that allows prisoners to more easily voice complaints. He's also hinted at changes to the prisoner dress code. \"Wearing pink underwear does nothing to change behavior,\" he told me.\n\nIf Penzone is to succeed where Arpaio failed, it will take more than changing the color of the prisoners' underwear and halting staff trips to Hawaii to investigate Obama's birth certificate. The Maricopa County jail has a long history of providing inadequate, inhumane, and life-threatening care for mentally ill people awaiting trial. Seriously mentally ill inmates, including those held incompetent to stand trial, have been held in solitary confinement, causing their conditions to worsen significantly. People have died unnecessarily while in custody, costing the county millions of dollars in lawsuits. A federal court stepped in to monitor the situation back in 2008; however, a 2016 court filing suggests the jail is still not in compliance with the court order, posing a continued risk of harm to some of the most vulnerable people in the sheriff's care.\n\nThis inhumane treatment extends to female inmates. Penzone is now overseeing an office that has previously compelled multiple women in custody, including women arrested for immigration-related offenses, to give birth to children while shackled , a practice that the American Medical Association has called \"medically hazardous\" and \"barbaric.\" One of these women reported that she was not even allowed to hold her baby until she was released from custody 70 days after the child's birth.\n\nPenzone will also be judged on how he handles the most basic duties of the sheriff's office. Arpaio's abysmal response times to 911 calls and low clearance rates received harsh criticism even from conservative groups such as the Goldwater Institute . Penzone could prioritize solving the county's most serious cases and ensure that his deputies respond to emergency calls with a timeliness that builds community confidence.\n\nOne big difference between the new sheriff and his headline-grabbing predecessor is that Penzone is, well, kind of boring. In January, Arizona Republic columnist E.J. Montini lamented , with tongue firmly planted in cheek, that Penzone must \"hate the media\" because he doesn't give journalists anything interesting to write about. \"We've grown accustomed to weird, sensational and bad news from the sheriff's office,\" Montini wrote. \"Joe Arpaio made the lives of many regular people very difficult, but he made the lives of hacks like me unbelievably easy.\" Penzone chuckled when I brought up that argument. \"I think it's the greatest compliment that anyone could have paid me,\" he said, \"that I'm more focused on the job than on making news.\"\n\nOne of Arpaio's biggest antagonists is a bit more circumspect, saying he'll wait to see if Penzone does in fact make the lives of regular people less difficult. \"It's going to be a very, very disappointed community if he doesn't live up to our hopes,\" Gutierrez, the former majority leader, said. \"The same sort of outrage that finally deposed Arpaio would be back with a vengeance.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Pitiful Excuse Sheriffs Trot Out for Not Arresting White Shooters of Black Victims\n\nEarlier this month, Ajike Owens, a Black mother of four, was gunned down in Ocala, Fla. in front of her 9-year-old son by a white neighbor who shot her from behind a door and then claimed self-defense. It took four days for the shooter, 58-year-old Susan Lorincz, to finally be arrested amidst growing media attention and public outrage. If this sounds familiar, it's because to find a similar case, you only have to go back to April when unarmed teen, Ralph Yarl, was shot twice by 84-year-old Andrew Lester after ringing the doorbell of the Missouri home he thought his siblings were visiting. In that case, the shooter also wasn't charged with any crime for four whole days .\n\nWhile both cases spotlight the inequity of our justifiable use of force laws alongside our increasingly lax regulation of civilian firearm use, a critical element of the stories and others like them has gone largely underexplored. \"Stand Your Ground\" laws across the country are providing local law enforcement a handy excuse for hesitating to arrest white shooters whose targets are Black.\n\nAlthough both Lester and Lorincz claimed that they acted out of fear for their lives, invoking a right to \"stand their ground,\" compelling evidence suggests racist aggression played a role in each. And yet, in each case, it took several days for charges to be filed.\n\nCases like these point to a concerning pattern in rates of arrest following cases of allegedly \"self-defensive\" gun violence. Ralph Yarl's shooter, Andrew Lester, was detained and questioned the night of the shooting, but was able to return home without being charged.\n\nOcala Sheriff Billy Woods, the primary law enforcement figure handling Owens' shooting death, offered as a reason for the delayed arrest that Florida's \" Stand Your Ground \" law prevents police from making an immediate arrest if the shooter claims to have acted in fear for his or her life. Law enforcement will often follow this practice in cases with Black victims and white shooters, even in a case like Owen's, where the shooter's fear seems dubious. Owens and her children were outside Lorincz's locked door, and Lorincz could have called the police if she truly felt endangered.\n\nComparing other cases reveals a pattern of delayed arrests after unarmed Black people have been killed by armed white people. Arrest hesitancy among law enforcement seems most prevalent in states like Florida, with provisions that make law enforcement officers liable for \"wrongful arrests,\" i.e. the arrest of shooters whom courts determine used force lawfully. While facially neutral, the \"wrongful arrest\" provisions can result in preferential treatment for white shooters who target Black people and then claim to have been in fear for their life. Law enforcement often delay arrests in cases where they believe the shooter has a chance of eventual acquittal. In 2018, Markeis McGlockton's killer, Michael Drejka, remained free for almost a month. And George Zimmerman was not taken into custody until 44 days after he pursued and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. (Zimmerman was controversially acquitted, while Drejka was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.)\n\nFlorida's \"Stand Your Ground\" law is the first of its kind and has served as a model for other states. As such, its \"wrongful arrest\" provision sets a dangerous precedent. Law enforcement in other states that lack such a stipulation often hesitate in making arrests because of the improper perception that \"Stand Your Ground\" requires an impossible burden of proof.\n\nThe racial implications can be stark. Compare for instance two stories of deadly \"road rage\" from Louisiana (a \"Stand Your Ground\" state) in 2016. The first is the shooting of retired New Orleans Saints star Will Smith by Cardell Hayes. Both men are Black, and Hayes was immediately arrested. Although he claimed to have acted in self-defense, Hayes was convicted. He is now awaiting a retrial after that conviction was vacated due to the non-unanimous jury verdict. In the second instance, former NFL player, Joe McKnight was shot by Ronald Gasser. Gasser, a white man, also claimed he shot in self-defense, and Sheriff Newell Normand didn't arrest him for five whole days . Gasser's conviction was also overturned due to the non-unanimous jury verdict, but he ultimately pled guilty to manslaughter before a retrial could be held.\n\nWhile law enforcement personnel claim that their hands are tied or that some homicides are \"close calls,\" requiring myriads of proof to justify an arrest, there is evidence to suggest they often use these \"wrongful arrest\" provisions as a shield, a viable excuse for failure to act on behalf of Black victims. In the recent case of Ajike Owens, the sheriff claimed that he could not arrest Lorincz until he was certain there was probable cause. Lorincz was charged only after prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump stepped up to represent Owens' bereaved family.\n\nThe hypocrisy of \"Stand Your Ground\" laws comes into even clearer focus when we consider similar cases where the demographics of the victim and the perpetrator are somewhat flipped. When women-especially Black or low income women-defend themselves against violent partners, spouses, or ex-spouses in \"Stand Your Ground\" states, they are generally charged right away without concern for police liability. In the cases of Marissa Alexander and Callie Adams , for instance, law enforcement did not hesitate to make arrests. Both women claimed to have used force in self-defense-fearful that their abusive spouses would harm or kill them-and were nevertheless arrested the same day as the incident. They were charged with homicide and prosecuted, and both were exonerated years later.\n\nThese cases further suggest that there is scant evidence that law enforcement is in any real danger of being sued for \"wrongful arrest.\" Rather, the \"Stand Your Ground\" stipulation provides a pitiful but oft-repeated excuse for not arresting aggressive, trigger-happy white people until media attention and public pressure intervene.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom's new restrictions face backlash as ICU capacity dwindles.\n\nby Jerusalem Demsas\n\nSheriffs of counties that represent nearly 40 percent of California's population are refusing to enforce Gov. Gavin Newsom's newest stay-at-home order aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 .\n\nSheriffs Alex Villanueva, Don Barnes, and Chad Bianco enforce the laws in Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties, respectively. In response to Newsom's announcement, Villanueva said he won't \"take part in enforcing stay at home orders at businesses,\" Barnes called compliance \"a matter of personal responsibility and not a matter of law enforcement,\" and Bianco said he wouldn't be \"blackmailed, bullied or used as muscle\" in carrying out the order.\n\nThe latest rules require regions where the adult ICU bed capacity falls below 15 percent to comply with a stay-at-home order for a minimum of three weeks. The order, once triggered, bans \"all gatherings with members of other households\" except in specific cases. KTTV Fox 11 in Los Angeles Fox reported that the order would also shut down all indoor and outdoor dining, limiting restaurants to takeout and delivery.\n\nThe Southern California region, which includes LA, Orange, and Riverside counties, dropped to 7.7 percent ICU capacity as of December 10 .\n\nNewsom's order comes amid a nationwide spike in coronavirus cases. Almost no states are seeing anything close to meaningful suppression of the virus, and daily death tolls are reaching record highs.\n\nThe standoff is largely about the terrible trade-offs between public health and economic activity, made all but inevitable by Congress's failure to pass more stimulus. By not providing the necessary financial assistance to individuals, businesses, and state and local governments, the federal government has put states in the unenviable position of mandating public health measures without the ability to compensate businesses and individuals suffering the consequences.\n\nAs Vox's Li Zhou has reported, Congress is still arguing over major components of a potential stimulus package, including whether to include unemployment assistance, business liability protections, and aid to state and local governments. The latest competing proposals, neither of which currently have enough support to move forward, carry price tags of more than $900 billion. But, as Vox's Emily Stewart recently noted, a new study has estimated that it will take between $3 and $4.5 trillion in near-term spending to \"get the economy to reach its full potential.\"\n\nMeanwhile, states were already facing budget shortfalls numbering in the hundreds of billions before the Covid-19 crisis hit. They're in no position to offer their residents and businesses the type of financial assistance that Congress could.\n\nThere is good news around the corner: The FDA appears on track to grant emergency approval of two separate vaccines in the coming days, with plans to vaccinate about 20 million people in high-risk groups by the end of 2020 and the rest of the US population over the next six months. But in the meantime, the country is exhausted, and residents are struggling to comply with public health guidance as the holiday season drives more people to gather with family and friends in person.\n\nJulia Marcus, epidemiologist and professor at Harvard Medical School, recently argued in the Atlantic that \"abstinence-only recommendations regarding social contact\" are a bad policy choice when it comes to Covid-19 prevention.

Gavin Newsom's new restrictions face backlash as ICU capacity dwindles.\n\nby Jerusalem Demsas\n\nSheriffs of counties that represent nearly 40 percent of California's population are refusing to enforce Gov. Gavin Newsom's newest stay-at-home order aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 .\n\nSheriffs Alex Villanueva, Don Barnes, and Chad Bianco enforce the laws in Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties, respectively. In response to Newsom's announcement, Villanueva said he won't \"take part in enforcing stay at home orders at businesses,\" Barnes called compliance \"a matter of personal responsibility and not a matter of law enforcement,\" and Bianco said he wouldn't be \"blackmailed, bullied or used as muscle\" in carrying out the order.\n\nThe latest rules require regions where the adult ICU bed capacity falls below 15 percent to comply with a stay-at-home order for a minimum of three weeks. The order, once triggered, bans \"all gatherings with members of other households\" except in specific cases. KTTV Fox 11 in Los Angeles Fox reported that the order would also shut down all indoor and outdoor dining, limiting restaurants to takeout and delivery.\n\nThe Southern California region, which includes LA, Orange, and Riverside counties, dropped to 7.7 percent ICU capacity as of December 10 .\n\nNewsom's order comes amid a nationwide spike in coronavirus cases. Almost no states are seeing anything close to meaningful suppression of the virus, and daily death tolls are reaching record highs.\n\nThe standoff is largely about the terrible trade-offs between public health and economic activity, made all but inevitable by Congress's failure to pass more stimulus. By not providing the necessary financial assistance to individuals, businesses, and state and local governments, the federal government has put states in the unenviable position of mandating public health measures without the ability to compensate businesses and individuals suffering the consequences.\n\nAs Vox's Li Zhou has reported, Congress is still arguing over major components of a potential stimulus package, including whether to include unemployment assistance, business liability protections, and aid to state and local governments. The latest competing proposals, neither of which currently have enough support to move forward, carry price tags of more than $900 billion. But, as Vox's Emily Stewart recently noted, a new study has estimated that it will take between $3 and $4.5 trillion in near-term spending to \"get the economy to reach its full potential.\"\n\nMeanwhile, states were already facing budget shortfalls numbering in the hundreds of billions before the Covid-19 crisis hit. They're in no position to offer their residents and businesses the type of financial assistance that Congress could.\n\nThere is good news around the corner: The FDA appears on track to grant emergency approval of two separate vaccines in the coming days, with plans to vaccinate about 20 million people in high-risk groups by the end of 2020 and the rest of the US population over the next six months. But in the meantime, the country is exhausted, and residents are struggling to comply with public health guidance as the holiday season drives more people to gather with family and friends in person.\n\nJulia Marcus, epidemiologist and professor at Harvard Medical School, recently argued in the Atlantic that \"abstinence-only recommendations regarding social contact\" are a bad policy choice when it comes to Covid-19 prevention. Instead, she writes, officials need to offer people \"practical ways to reduce risk that go beyond 'Just say no'\" - especially if they're going to dine indoors themselves in defiance of their own rules.\n\nThe defiant sheriffs are expressing a very real frustration nearly a year into the Covid-19 pandemic.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTwo county primaries in North Carolina might be Trump's biggest setback of the primary season so far. A new report shows why.\n\nby Dara Lind\n\nThe biggest setback the Trump administration has suffered so far in the 2018 primaries might have come in a sheriff's race in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina - where the victorious challenger has promised to reduce his office's cooperation with federal agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Alternatively, it might have been in a sheriff's race in the state's Durham County, where another incumbent got swept out by a challenger who promised to end local cooperation with ICE requests entirely.\n\nProgressive victories in local criminal justice races - including prosecutors as well as sheriffs - have been a trend in the early stages of the 2018 cycle. Unlike most criminal justice policy, though, immigration policy is set by the federal government; the only choices local officials can make are how easy to make the jobs of ICE agents in identifying and apprehending deportable immigrants.\n\nBut new data suggests that under President Trump, the decisions that local officials make about cooperating with ICE - or refusing to cooperate - actually matter a lot for ICE's ability to ramp up arrests and deportations. The trend of blue \"sanctuary\" cities and states where many unauthorized immigrants live reducing cooperation with ICE (even while it expands elsewhere) could make it extremely hard for the Trump administration even to return immigration enforcement to the levels of President Obama's first term. And the new sheriffs in town in North Carolina's Mecklenburg and Durham counties are poised, when they get sworn in after the November elections, to restrict ICE's access further still.\n\nMecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, has long been at the forefront of local cooperation with ICE. Its first agreement with the federal government to deputize local officials to help enforce immigration law (known as a 287(g) agreement) was signed in February 2006; the sheriff at the time acknowledged that its goal was to apprehend and send to ICE as many unauthorized immigrants as possible. It became a model for 287(g) agreements in the Southeast .\n\nMore than 15,000 people have been put in deportation proceedings in Mecklenburg County as a result of the 287(g) agreement.\n\nBut that era is coming to an end. In Tuesday's Democratic primary, incumbent Sheriff Irwin Carmichael (who signed the latest version of the county's 287(g) agreement) was beaten by challenger Gerry McFadden, who made abolishing the agreement part of his platform. \"287(g) is going to be history,\" McFadden proclaimed at his victory party on Tuesday . \"It is going to be an event.\" (Because no Republican candidates have entered the race, winning the primary is tantamount to winning the election, though McFadden won't be sworn in until 2019.)\n\nThe end of 287(g) doesn't mean the end of deportations in Mecklenburg - state and local officials can't prevent ICE from coming in and arresting people for deportation - and still leaves the door open for some participation with ICE. Ending 287(g) will stop immigration enforcement in local jails by sheriff's deputies but doesn't necessarily bar ICE officials from coming into jails to check inmates' immigration status.\n\nMcFadden still has to resolve the question of whether he'll start declining ICE \"detainers\": requests from ICE to hold people in custody up to 48 hours after they'd otherwise be released to give federal agents a chance to pick them up.\n\nICE detainers were a focus of another North Carolina sheriff's race, in Durham County. Incumbent Mike Andrews, who had promised to keep honoring the requests, lost. His successor-to-be, Clarence Birkhead, has promised to stop honoring them .\n\nImmigration was a key issue in these races, especially in Mecklenburg. Reducing cooperation with ICE wasn't an auxiliary outcome of electing a candidate who'd run on other things; it was a key distinction between the candidates, and the candidate who promised to reduce cooperation won. One activist in Charlotte boasted that McFadden won on the backs of \"single-shot voters\": Latinos and others who voted only in the sheriff's race.\n\nThese races weren't just about politics or the victory of one vision for America over another. Once these sheriffs are sworn in, their new policies are likely to have an immediate impact on the lives of their immigrant residents - and further divorce the places ICE can most efficiently deport immigrants from the places most immigrants actually live.\n\nUnder Trump, a lot more immigrants living in the United States are being arrested and put into deportation proceedings than under the last years of the Obama administration. But they haven't yet surpassed Obama's first term, when more than 400,000 immigrants a year were being deported and local-federal cooperation was at its peak. A new study from the Migration Policy Institute , a nonpartisan immigration think tank, suggests that maybe they never will.\n\nThe report's authors visited 25 local jurisdictions in the first months of the Trump administration to document immigration enforcement on the ground.\n\nOne of their conclusions was that efforts in blue states and cities to reduce local cooperation with ICE really have hampered the ability of ICE agents to book immigrants into custody. California has led the way, passing a state law that limits local officials' ability to honor detainer requests and bars ICE officials from accessing county jails in many cases - and which has inspired a federal lawsuit from Jeff Sessions's Department of Justice . Other states and cities had reined in their cooperation under Obama, ending their 287(g) agreements or setting restrictions on when to honor detainer requests, and are unlikely to bring them back under Trump.\n\nImmigrants are still getting deported from those places, but it takes more effort to find them and apprehend them, so fewer of them can be rounded up. Because so many of America's unauthorized immigrants live in these places, the MPI report concludes, the increased cooperation ICE is getting from rural and scattered counties isn't enough to make up for the lost efficiency.\n\nIt's possible that ICE just can't return to 2011 levels of enforcement, at least without an unprecedented infusion of funds from Congress. (And Congress has been unwilling to write the Trump administration blank checks on immigration.)\n\nThe major exception is Texas, where a state law mandates that local officials cooperate with ICE. So far, the ICE field office that covers North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia has been another exception: ICE arrests of immigrants jumped 53 percent from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017, according to MPI. (Those three states contain about 7.3 percent of the US's unauthorized immigrants as of 2014, but accounted for 9.4 percent of 2017 arrests.) Mecklenburg County's 287(g) agreement could be one factor in this, the MPI authors note, since it's one of the remaining counties with a substantial immigrant population cooperating with ICE.\n\nBut it won't be cooperating anymore - or at least, not fully. Because county jails are ICE's point of access to local law enforcement, sheriff's department policies matter a lot. ICE is now losing its ease of access to two counties with a relatively large share of unauthorized immigrants. Mecklenburg County's unauthorized population ranked it 35th in the country in 2014, according to MPI data, but over a dozen of the more populous counties were in California, and several more were in other places that have restricted ICE cooperation.\n\n\"The fortunes of an unauthorized immigrant,\" the MPI report concludes, \"are quite different in Texas, Tennessee, and Georgia, where the mere act of driving can result in arrest and deportation\" (because police routinely arrest unauthorized immigrants for driving without licenses they can't legally obtain, and cooperate in turning them over to ICE) \"than in California, Chicago, and New York.\" Mecklenburg and Durham counties are about to move closer to the noncooperative end of that spectrum - the end where immigrants face lower risk of deportation.\n\nIf ICE keeps losing efficient access to the places where unauthorized immigrants live in great numbers, it will likely their capacity across the board. In the meantime, those places are where immigrants are most vulnerable. But as North Carolina shows, the places that have enough unauthorized immigrants for cooperation with ICE (or lack thereof) to make a difference are also places that have enough Latino US citizens (and sympathetic progressive allies) to elect politicians who will restrict it.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe new sheriffs have promised to end cooperative agreements with ICE at the local level.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nThree Democratic sheriffs who have promised to cut ties with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement will soon assume office in some of Georgia's and South Carolina's most populous counties after defeating hardline Republicans.\n\nAll of them have promised to end longstanding agreements with the federal government under which sheriffs can question people about their immigration status and detain them on immigration charges.\n\nThese agreements, known as 287(g) agreements after the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that created them, predate President Donald Trump. But Trump has vastly expanded the 287(g) program, issuing an executive order during the first weeks of his presidency that allowed him to rapidly sign more such agreements with local law enforcement to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants living in the US. During fiscal year 2019 alone, the agreements allowed local law enforcement to take almost 25,000 immigrants into custody.\n\nOpponents say they foster distrust of law enforcement in immigrant communities, result in racial profiling, yield few arrests of violent criminals who should be prioritized for deportation, and prove costly for local authorities, who foot the bill of carrying them out.\n\nIn Georgia's Gwinnett County, Democrat Keybo Taylor, a police major, prevailed over Republican Chief Deputy Sheriff Lou Solis. The county's 287(g) agreement had been used to refer more than 21,000 people in the county to ICE over the past decade, making it one of ICE's biggest local law enforcement partners outside of counties on the US-Mexico border.\n\n\"Along the campaign trail, I spent hours listening to your needs. You voiced concerns for community inclusion, neighborhood safety, the 287(g) program and nonviolent interactions with law enforcement personnel,\" Taylor told his supporters in a letter last week. \"In the upcoming months, my team and I will implement robust plans which will address these concerns. My goal as your sheriff is to lead an office that truly serves the needs of every constituent in our county.\"\n\nIn nearby Cobb County, Democrat Craig Owens, also a police major, ousted incumbent Republican Sheriff Neil Warren, who has held office for 17 years and was the first sheriff in the state to enter into a 287(g) agreement. Taylor and Owens are also their counties' first black sheriffs.\n\nAnd in Charleston County, South Carolina, Kristin Graziano, a former master deputy at the sheriff's office who was put on leave once she announced her candidacy, defeated incumbent Sheriff Al Cannon, who had never seen a serious challenger and had run unopposed in the general election for eight terms.\n\nDemocrats also fended off pro-ICE sheriff candidates in Ohio's Hamilton County and Arizona's Maricopa County , where the infamous former Sheriff Joe Arpaio once targeted immigrants and sought to implement one of the most restrictive \"show me your papers\" laws in the country.\n\nThe election of these sheriffs, who made cutting ties with ICE a central message of their campaigns, is a triumph for immigrant rights activists. They view it as a signal that the public doesn't think local law enforcement should be involved in efforts to deport members of their communities and spread fear among immigrants.\n\n\"I think voters tend to think of immigration as a federal matter, and it is, and so they often don't want their local police, who should be focused upon the public safety of everyone in the community, distracted by efforts to be immigration agents,\" said Ronald Newman, the political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which worked with grassroots organizations in Georgia and South Carolina to galvanize support for the anti-ICE sheriff candidates.\n\n\"At the end of the day, local police should do their job, not the federal government's job, and that sentiment is what we try to tap into when we do this work,\" he added.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates argue that the 287(g) program isn't improving public safety, but rather undermining it.\n\nThere are two kinds of 287(g) agreements that local law enforcement can sign: the jail enforcement model and the warrant service officer model. The jail enforcement model allows local law enforcement to interrogate people who have been arrested on state or local charges about their immigration status as well as process them for deportation by ICE. The more limited warrant service officer model, which the Trump administration created in May 2019, trains local law enforcement to carry out civil immigration warrants issued by ICE for the arrests of unauthorized immigrants, even in places that have adopted sanctuary policies. But it doesn't allow local law enforcement to interrogate people about their immigration status.\n\nBoth types of agreements formalize cooperation between the federal government and local law enforcement. But even in the absence of these agreements, local law enforcement could still, for example, opt to share information with ICE or allow the agency into local jails without a judicial warrant, unless state and local governments have otherwise prohibited those practices.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has invoked the program as a means to keep criminals off the streets, the Migration Policy Institute found that half of all the requests to detain unauthorized immigrants issued through the program were directed at people who had committed misdemeanors and traffic offenses.\n\nIn places like North Carolina's Alamance County and Arizona's Maricopa County (which has since ended its agreement), the program led to widespread racial profiling of Latinos, damaging the relationship between law enforcement and the community. Both the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Major Cities Chiefs Association - which represent law enforcement in the US and Canada - have stated that unauthorized immigrants are more fearful to contact police or assist in investigations without assurance that they will not be targeted for deportation.\n\nTrump has also made changes to the 287(g) program. While the agreements were previously designed to expire after three years, prompting regular conversations at the local level over whether they should be renewed, ICE is no longer placing end dates on the agreements. The agency has also allowed local law enforcement to arrest unauthorized immigrants and refer them for deportation proceedings without filing charges in criminal court, leading to baseless arrests.\n\nEnding these agreements would foster more trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities.\n\n\"There is an embrace that is signaled when a sheriff exits from one of these agreements that I think has a really significant effect within these communities,\" Newman said. \"The message being conveyed is that you are fully a member of this community and my role is to protect and serve you.\"\n\nThe 287(g) program was created under a law signed by President Bill Clinton and supported by then-Sen. Joe Biden and other Democrats. But Biden vowed this August that he would end all of the Trump's administration's new 287(g) agreements and \"aggressively limit the use of 287(g) and similar programs that force local law enforcement to take on the role of immigration enforcement.\"\n\nCurrently, 148 total jurisdictions have signed 287(g) agreements, including 126 that did so under the Trump administration.\n\n\"We would encourage him to take another step further and actually exit from all 287(g) agreements entirely, and he can do that completely on his own - no conversation with Congress required,\" Newman said of Biden.\n\nAside from 287(g) agreements, there are other programs under which federal immigration authorities can deputize local law enforcement.\n\nAnd under intergovernmental service agreements, the federal government pays local authorities to provide space in jails and prisons to detain unauthorized immigrants beyond a 48-hour limit on detaining people in non-ICE facilities for immigration violations.\n\nBiden also would have the power to stop these programs unilaterally, but he has not yet elaborated on his plans. On the campaign trail, he promised that he would focus on deporting only immigrants who pose a threat to national security and public safety and that he would improve accountability for immigration agencies like ICE, without delving into specifics.\n\nBut even if Biden keeps some or all of these programs intact, Newman said the ACLU intends to scope out opportunities to lift up sheriff candidates who oppose this kind of cooperation with federal immigration authorities in the 2022 election cycle.\n\nFrederick County, Maryland, where the sheriff's office recently prohibited profiling or targeting people based on their immigration status and arresting people based on ICE warrants, seems to already be moving in the direction of cutting ties with ICE. But other targets could include Alamance County, North Carolina; Bristol, Plymouth, and Barnstable counties in Massachusetts; and Kenosha County, Wisconsin.\n\n\"It's a second failsafe that leaves us comfortable that local involvement in federal immigration enforcement won't occur, irrespective of what president is in office and what request they make,\" Newman said.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Chris Van Hollen about Kilmar Abrego Garcia's detention - and where America goes from here.\n\nAs Trump wages war against Harvard, something unprecedented is happening on Florida's college campuses.\n\n﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.\n\n﻿Biden got immigration wrong.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOver about half a century, police unions have become one of the most powerful lobbies in local government.\n\nby Dylan Matthews\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd's killing by now-former Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) officer Derek Chauvin, few have been inclined to defend Chauvin or his colleagues who stood by and watched as he suffocated Floyd to death. Few, that is, except Bob Kroll.\n\nIn a letter to membership , Kroll - the president of the MPD's police union - referred to protesters outraged by police brutality as a \"terrorist movement\" and defended the officers who killed Floyd and were subsequently fired, arguing they were \"terminated without due process\" and lamenting, \"What is not being told is the violent criminal history of George Floyd.\" (Floyd had a criminal record, but mostly for nonviolent drug and theft charges .)\n\nKroll's statements illustrate a central challenge in American efforts to transform policing: Police unions, the groups that represent police officers, are a powerful force that stands in the way of holding police accountable. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told the New York Times that Kroll and his union are a major reason it's hard to bring order to the Minneapolis Police Department, saying they create a \"nearly impenetrable barrier\" to reform.\n\nIt's not just in Minneapolis. Around the country, as protesters take to the streets to condemn police violence and demand change, police unions have emerged as the protesters' most vocal and implacable foe.\n\nIn Buffalo, the city's Police Benevolent Association president John Evans has actively defended officers who pushed 75-year-old protester Martin Gugino to the ground. When the officers who pushed Gugino were seen leaving their arraignment on felony assault charges, a large crowd of police union members and sympathizers was seen cheering them on. In New York State broadly, police unions led opposition to newly signed legislation that prevents police from hiding misconduct complaints and criminalizes chokeholds.\n\nThese are hardly aberrations. Police unions in general have become the most vocal interest group opposing criminal justice reforms and especially reforms to police discipline and use of force. Historically, they have, unlike most unions, been profoundly conservative institutions that uphold a particular white ethnic, \"law and order\"-focused variant of right-wing politics. They have been among Donald Trump's most fervent allies; Kroll spoke at a Trump rally in 2018 , and the International Union of Police Associations has already endorsed Trump for reelection.\n\nThe foregrounding of police unions' role in the warping of American law enforcement has also prompted some difficult conversations on the left. The presence of a segment of a union movement that's unapologetically right-wing and hostile to Black communities has tested the limits of solidarity from more left-wing unionists.\n\nAs long as police forces exist, police unions will exist in some form as well, even if just as political pressure groups. It is therefore natural to think that reforming police unions in some way must be part of the broader agenda of changing policing in America. They are among the biggest stakeholders in the way the system works now; without addressing their power, other reforms may never get off the ground.\n\nThe creation of police unions was a somewhat ironic twist in American labor history, University of Minnesota labor historian Will Jones tells me, given that the creation of urban police forces was largely spurred by a desire to contain union activism and protest.\n\n\"The whole creation of the police force in the late 19th century was largely in response to labor conflict,\" Jones says. Police departments emerged and evolved as adjuncts to the sheriff's departments and private detective agencies (like the Pinkertons) that bosses typically enlisted to fight union activists.\n\nThe (rough) anniversary of the Haymarket affair of 1886, a protest against anti-union violence by police in which an unknown assailant threw a bomb at Chicago police and a firefight broke out, is still commemorated on May 1 as International Workers' Day in numerous countries worldwide. Union demonstrators and police would square off repeatedly in ensuing decades: in Cleveland in 1894 , Philadelphia in 1910 , Minneapolis in 1934 , Chicago in 1937 , and Hilo, Hawaii, in 1938 , among many other incidents.\n\nThe anti-union role of police began to ebb in the first half of the 20th century with the coming of the New Deal and the Great Migration of Black workers from the South to Northern cities, says Aaron Bekemeyer, a doctoral candidate in history at Harvard whose dissertation documents the emergence of police unions in Philadelphia and nationally.\n\nThe New Deal, especially the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, legalized a lot of union activity, including strikes, and so shunted the task of managing labor conflict from local police to federal bureaucrats. The Great Migration, in turn, gave urban police another population to police, namely Black people. \"Policing of Black neighborhoods, drug policing, gang policing become what these big-city police forces do,\" Bekemeyer says.\n\nThe trend of allowing public sector unions began in New York City, when Mayor Robert Wagner Jr. , the son of Sen. Robert Wagner who wrote the National Labor Relations Act, issued regulations that allowed collective bargaining by municipal employees in 1958 . Wisconsin followed suit in 1959 , and many states came after that. In 1962, the federal government under John F. Kennedy legalized collective bargaining for its employees. The spread of this idea helped fuel the growth of teachers unions, sanitation workers unions , and other public employee unions - including police unions.\n\nThe rise in violent crime in the 1960s, riots in places like Watts in 1965, Detroit and Newark in 1967, and nationwide in 1968, and the rise of tough-on-crime policing targeted at Black neighborhoods also enhanced the political power of police unions: \"The police unions say, 'Hey, we're the ones doing this work and protecting you, implied white listener, from dangerous Black people, and you need the gains unions need. Union interests are public interests,'\" says Bekemeyer.\n\nWhile the jobs are very different in obvious ways, the rhetoric parallels arguments that teachers unions under leaders like Al Shanker were making to the public around the same time: that the demands teachers were making would help students and parents too, and thus teachers deserve the public's solidarity.\n\n\"The stakes are very different because the jobs are very different, but it's useful to see the police union movement as one of the most successful examples of social movement unionism,\" Bekemeyer notes.\n\nPolice unionism is just a very different kind of social movement unionism than that involved in, say, collaborations between civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Bayard Rustin and union leaders like United Auto Workers head Walter Reuther during the postwar years.\n\nBekemeyer notes that police officers, especially in the Northeast, tended disproportionately in the 1950s through 1970s to be working-class \"white ethnic\" conservatives: mostly Irish, but occasionally Italian or Polish, too. \"It's a broader white ethnic politics that uses the language of tradition, neighborhood integrity, hard work, etc., to defend segregated institutions that they benefit from, from schools to certain union jobs in the trade to religious institutions,\" Bekemeyer says.\n\nThis pattern comes through across the country, but Bekemeyer's case study of Philadelphia is instructive, largely because one specific politician there embodied this identity better than any other American official of the time: Frank Rizzo, who served as Philadelphia police commissioner from 1968 to 1971 and mayor from 1972 to 1980.\n\nRizzo was about as blatant a racist as led a major American city in the modern era. During his 1978 reelection bid, he urged supporters to \"Vote White\" ; he fervently fought efforts to desegregate Philadelphia schools and build public housing in white neighborhoods. In a deposition , he stated he \"considered public housing to be the same as Black housing in that most tenants of public housing are Black. Mayor Rizzo therefore felt that there should not be any public housing placed in White neighborhoods because people in White neighborhoods did not want Black people moving in with them.\"\n\nThis extended to Rizzo's governance of the police. He once famously declared that his treatment of protesters would \"make Attila the Hun look like a fa**ot.\" As commissioner, he ordered a raid on Black Panther headquarters in which suspects were publicly stripped in front of photographers, and at least once ordered police to beat stationary protesters with nightsticks.\n\nOn this, police unions were mostly a strong ally, echoing the role they would play in many cities as representatives of white ethnic conservative interests in ensuing decades. Alphonso Deal, a Black police officer in Philadelphia who began a separate union for Black officers who faced discrimination from leaders like Rizzo, once tried to run for the presidency of the Fraternal Order of Police local in the hope of breaking the police out of this mold, but Bekemeyer describes this attempt as \"quixotic.\" FOP was more interested in resisting affirmative action measures that it viewed as allowing officers who hadn't \"earned their place\" to get in ahead of the white ethnics the union represented.\n\nThe Philadelphia case is especially vivid, but you see examples of this kind of behavior from police unions around the country from the 1960s to the present.\n\nIn one particularly glaring case, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association (since renamed the Police Benevolent Association for gender equality reasons) rioted around City Hall against David Dinkins, New York City's first and to date only Black mayor , to protest Dinkins's plan to create a civilian review board to oversee the police. Ten thousand protesters, mostly off-duty cops, appeared, and more than 4,000 broke through police barricades, surrounded City Hall, and took over Brooklyn Bridge. Protesters hurled the n-word and other racial slurs at Black people nearby, including city councilor Una Clarke .\n\nOne hears similar rhetoric, albeit with the sharp edges sanded down a bit, out of police unions today. Their rhetoric remains rooted in the notion that police are the one barrier between civilization and chaos. \"The scenes we witnessed earlier this month - burning police vehicles, looted storefronts and violent clashes between protesters and police officers - will remain etched in New Yorkers' collective memory. They are symbols of a breakdown in our social contract that none of us want to see repeated,\" Pat Lynch of New York City's Police Benevolent Association declared in a statement on June 17.\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising, given both police unions' historic conservatism and their charge of defending members against unjust or arbitrary discipline, that defending and preventing discipline against police who kill or wound unarmed civilians, particularly Black civilians, has become a major preoccupation of police unions since the Black Lives Matter movement's emergence.\n\nTellingly, when the International Union of Police Associations endorsed Trump for president in late 2015, they specifically cited as a root cause what they viewed as the Democratic presidential candidate's slander of Darren Wilson, the white officer who in 2014 shot 18-year-old Black teenager Michael Brown to death in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\"Every top Democrat currently running for this office has vilified the police and made criminals out to be victims,\" union president Sam Cabral wrote. \"Many of them still refer to the tragedy in Ferguson as a murder, despite the conclusions of every investigative inquiry to the contrary.\" (A St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Wilson for murder, and the US Department of Justice declined to prosecute him for civil rights violations . However, the DOJ also found a pattern of racial bias and brutality in the Ferguson police department.)\n\nIn local cases, this attitude has translated to a defense of officers who kill or wound innocent civilians. The Louisville Metro Police Department has been limited to just announcing its \"intention\" to fire Brett Hankison, a detective who shot his gun 10 times during the raid that killed Breonna Taylor, rather than actually firing him outright. This limitation is largely because of the city's contract with the police union, which gives Hankison multiple opportunities to appeal. He is first allowed a \"pretermination hearing\" with counsel , and then, once terminated, an appeal to the police merit board, of which Hankison himself is a member.\n\nIn extreme cases, this resistance to discipline has translated into \"depolicing,\" in which police forces cease making arrests as a protest against civilian leaders and activists whom they perceive as demonizing police.\n\nThe NYPD conducted a work slowdown in late 2014 and early 2015 over perceived disrespect from Mayor Bill de Blasio - though crime actually fell during the slowdown according to a subsequent study analyzing the period (but that might just be because the slowdown was limited to low-level offenses). PBA president Pat Lynch called for another slowdown in 2019 when the police commissioner fired officer Daniel Pantaleo for choking Eric Garner to death five years earlier.\n\nIn Baltimore, a police slowdown known as \"the pullback\" ensued after the district attorney indicted officers for the death of Freddie Gray in 2015; many analysts, like ProPublica's Alec MacGillis , attribute the 62 percent jump in homicides in 2015 at least in part to police just giving up on their jobs.\n\nThere is also some limited evidence that police unions themselves make use of force problems worse.\n\nUniversity of Chicago Law School's Dhammika Dharmapala, Richard McAdams, and John Rappaport looked at a 2003 Florida Supreme Court decision that gave collective bargaining rights to sheriffs' deputies. They use police departments, which were unaffected, as a control group, and find that in the wake of the decision, misconduct violations rose in sheriff's offices but not in police departments. That suggests that collective bargaining itself caused a rise in misconduct, perhaps by making sheriff's deputies feel like they could get away with it.\n\nAnother study by economists Rob Gillezeau, Jamein Cunningham, and Donna Feir, which has yet to be published but was discussed by one of its authors on NPR's Planet Money podcast , used the varying times at which different states rolled out collective bargaining rights to police unions starting in the late 1950s to see if introducing police unions made a difference in police killings.\n\nThey found it did, Gillezeau told NPR:\n\nWe found that after officers gained access to collective bargaining rights that there was a substantial increase in killings of civilians - 0.026 to 0.029 additional civilians are killed in each county in each year, of whom the overwhelming majority are nonwhite. That's about 60 to 70 per year civilians killed by the police in an era historically where there were a lot fewer police shootings. So that's a humongous increase.\n\nAnother study by Oxford's Abdul Rad found that police union contract provisions protecting police are correlated with greater police abuse, though the study warns that it's hard to prove the relationship is causal.\n\nAnother way to look at this question is to examine the text of police union contracts. In 2018, Stephen Rushin, a law professor at Loyola University Chicago, examined 656 police union contracts and found that \"the vast majority of these departments give police officers the ability to appeal disciplinary sanctions through multiple levels of appellate review. At the end of this process, the majority of departments allow officers to appeal disciplinary sanctions to an arbitrator selected, in part, by the local police union or the aggrieved officer.\"\n\nRushin notes, \"While each of these appellate procedures may be individually defensible, they combine in many police departments to create a formidable barrier to officer accountability.\"\n\nRushin has found similar problems examining provisions of police contracts not related to the appeals process, including, for instance, rules giving officers a heads-up that they will be interviewed by internal affairs detectives or other investigators in a few days about a case of potential wrongdoing. \"Most people, including myself, would say if you provide officers with delays telling them we'll interview you in two days, that probably is a barrier to accountability,\" Rushin told me.\n\n\"Notifying that you're about to talk gives them time to compare stories\" and potentially come up with fake alibis or other lies. It's a subtle matter, however: Notification that enables an officer to obtain legal representation seems like an essential due process provision, but notification long enough to enable cover stories goes too far.\n\nMuch of the difficulty in studying police unions is in how to think about these kinds of provisions, Rushin told me. \"One thing I've learned going through this process is what one person calls due process, another person calls a problematic provision,\" he says. \"A lot is in the eye of who's doing the coding.\"\n\nBeyond the difficulty police unions present as a state and local policy matter, they pose a particularly grave challenge to the labor movement at large.\n\nThe American left and labor have been close allies for more than a century, and often the struggle for racial equality and labor rights went hand in hand (see, for instance, A. Philip Randolph , whose Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters organized Black passenger train stewards to fight for both Black equality and economic gains).\n\n\"The whole creation of the police force in the late 19th century was largely in response to labor conflict\"\n\nSome on the left want to abolish both police and the unions who organize them. Kim Kelly, a labor journalist and vocal activist within Writers Guild of America, East (of which I am also a member), led the charge to push police unions out of the labor movement in a New Republic article . Activism from her and others led WGA-E to call on its parent federation, the AFL-CIO, to disaffiliate from the International Union of Police Associations .\n\nSome veteran labor lawyers and academic labor activists are also opening up to the idea of sharply limiting police union power, recognizing this as an unusual case.\n\nA group of faculty at Cornell's Industrial and Labor Relations school - Ifeoma Ajunwa, Virginia Doellgast, Shannon Gleeson, Kate Griffith, and Verónica Martínez-Matsuda - argued in a public statement that the labor movement \"must also acknowledge that contemporary police unions have contributed to racism.\" Benjamin Sachs, the Kestenbaum professor of labor and industry at Harvard Law School and a leading voice in labor law debates, published a blog post suggesting openness to limiting what issues police unions can legally bargain over , perhaps excluding from bargaining matters like discipline for police who beat or kill civilians.\n\n\"The consequence of police abusing [collective bargaining] power is that people end up dead,\" Sharon Block, executive director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law and a member of the National Labor Relations Board under President Obama, told me. \"That is happening at a significant rate and that's just a completely different context from the rest of the public sector\" or unionism generally.\n\nSo far, these efforts have come to little. The AFL-CIO itself has firmly resisted calls to disaffiliate , and no limitations on police unions were included in House Democrats' call to reform policing.\n\nMoreover, there are many in the labor movement who think calls for purging or outlawing police unions go much too far and risks endangering other public sector workers, like teachers, whose collective bargaining rights have been threatened in recent decades.\n\n\"If you look back at prior incidents in American labor history where labor groups kicked out other labor groups over fundamental disagreements about strategy, about priorities, it generally didn't turn out well for the cause of labor,\" Catherine Fisk, a law professor at UC Berkeley and a prominent voice on labor law, told me.\n\nThere are two extremes on the police union debate. On one end of the spectrum, there's the attitude of local police union leaders like Pat Lynch and Bob Kroll, who state they are open to reform while in practice they fight almost every measure, even mild ones, meant to rein in police misconduct.\n\nOn the other is abolishing police and police unions, as advocated from the left by labor radicals like Kelly, or simply abolishing the unions, as advocated by many right-wing opponents of public sector unions generally. If police still existed in this world, they would of course be allowed to form organizations that advocated for their interests. But police departments would not be obliged to negotiate with those organizations on pay and discipline, as they are in most unionized jurisdictions today.\n\nMost police union experts I spoke with, though, fell in the middle: They believe that police unions can be usefully reformed without being abolished.\n\nThere are a number of possible models for this kind of reform. The organization Campaign Zero , co-founded by activists DeRay Mckesson and Samuel Sinyangwe, has been a leader in pushing for police union contract transparency; much of the research above relies on contracts they've surfaced publicly.\n\nThey recommend a bevy of contract changes, most of which involve removing provisions included in many union contracts or state laws known as Law Enforcement Officers' Bills of Rights (LEOBRs) , which provide similar protections to police officers as contracts do but are implemented as state legislation instead. Problematic provisions in contracts and LEOBRs include mandates that delay interrogations of officers (as Rushin highlighted), the ability to appeal to an arbitrator partially chosen by the police union, and bans on investigating misconduct that happened more than 100 days in the past.\n\nRushin has proposed allowing the public to observe collective bargaining between the police and state governments. That way, the public can exert pressure on city leaders not to yield to police union demands about discipline. A 2017 Reuters investigation found that in a number of cities, such as San Antonio, city leaders have given police unions concessions as an explicit trade-off for not offering high pay or limiting pay cuts. \"If that trade-off is publicly visible, that our failure to compensate is causing cities to give significant concessions on discipline,\" Rushin notes, then public pressure might force the city to increase police salaries rather than reducing accountability.\n\nL. Song Richardson, the dean of UC Irvine School of Law and an eminent criminal law expert, and Berkeley's Catherine Fisk have proposed a system of \"minority unionism\" for police departments . The idea is to use the increasing racial diversity of many police departments to push for useful reforms by enabling the creation of groups like, say, a Black Lives Matter organization within a police department that also has the right to bargain around disciplinary issues with the department.\n\nMultiracial coalitions opposed to the current police union leadership could also form and gain power; Richardson and Fisk note that PBA president Pat Lynch faced energetic reelection challenges in the wake of his inflammatory statements about Eric Garner's killing, suggesting a real minority within the NYPD was dissatisfied with his leadership. Black police officers, in polling data, seem to have vastly different political beliefs and are much more sympathetic to claims of racial discrimination than white officers. Pew Research Center found that while 92 percent of white officers say the US has \"made the changes needed to give blacks equal rights with whites\"; only 29 percent of Black officers agree.\n\nBeyond minority unionism, Fisk has another idea to better align cities' incentives in bargaining: using Congress to partially overrule Monell v. Department of Social Services , a relatively obscure 1978 Supreme Court decision that among other holdings found that local governments cannot be forced to pay up in civil suits due to the actions of their employees.\n\nSuppose that a FedEx deliveryperson pushed you onto the sidewalk, causing a head injury when you fell. The deliveryperson would be liable in a civil suit, and so would FedEx. But it's different with government. Qualified immunity generally protects police officers and other public employees from lawsuits; meanwhile, a principle called \"vicarious liability\" protects police departments and city governments from such lawsuits. Fisk argues that Congress should reverse Monell and allow governments to be held liable for police officers' misconduct.\n\nThe most dramatic reform, short of outright abolishing collective bargaining rights for police unions, is one that Harvard's Sachs suggested sympathy toward and the Boston Globe has editorialized in favor of : limiting police unions to simply bargaining on wages and hours, not on discipline. This change is already the law in Massachusetts. (Fisk argues this would go too far. \"There's two sides to the contract; why are we focused only on what unions are asking for rather than focusing on what cities are asking for?\" she says.)\n\nReforming police unions is hardly the only important task in efforts to reform the police generally. But there is an emerging consensus that something significant has to change in these organizations. If not, they will remain unaccountable lobbies that frustrate even mild efforts to reform police departments and save the lives of unarmed civilians.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter and we'll send you a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling the world's biggest challenges - and how to get better at doing good.\n\nYou've read 1 article in the last month\n\nHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you - threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.\n\nOur mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe \"Banditos\" say they're a fraternal club for LA deputies. But critics allege that the group violently harasses civilians - and other officers.\n\nby P.R. Lockhart\n\nAs concerns over police misconduct and use of force have drawn increased national attention in recent years, activists have argued that a key part of the problem is the ability for officers to shield one another from accountability.\n\nBut in California, critics of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department have been faced with a unique version of the issue: the existence of what have been called \" deputy gangs \" - cliques of officers who allegedly engage in violent and potentially criminal behavior while protecting their members and clashing with other law enforcement officers.\n\nThese groups, which have reportedly been around in some form or another in Los Angeles County since the 1970s , have been a frequent topic of local media reporting. Outlets like the Los Angeles Times have highlighted how other officers have filed formal complaints about the \"secretive groups,\" describing them as powerful forces within the sheriff's department who beat and harass local residents and, at times, actively work to intimidate other nonaffiliated officers.\n\nMany of the deputy cliques share common features: hierarchical structures, intensive recruitment, hazing of younger officers, and a resistance to outsiders. But one of the features that has been most commonly cited is tattoos. Members of a specific group often have a shared \"ink\" that symbolizes their membership. In some instances, according to reports, this ink is only granted after a deputy commits an illegal act or violates department protocol to show their loyalty to the group. In other cases, deputies allegedly received additional markings after fulfilling certain conditions, like committing police brutality or being involved in a shooting.\n\nSuch groups are not exclusive to Los Angeles County, but the area has reportedly had a particularly difficult time dealing with the groups. \"Defenders say the cliques are harmless fraternities, likening them to close-knit groups in the military,\" the LA Times noted in a July article . \"But time and again, the deputy clubs have come under fire for promoting aggressive tactics and an us-versus-everyone mentality.\"\n\nAccording to the Times, there have been several clubs that have existed in the various stations under the sheriff's department, with some groups becoming defunct, leaving new cliques to take their place. In late September, eight LASD deputies filed a lawsuit against one such group, called the \"Banditos,\" a deputy clique of several dozen members who operate out of the department's East Los Angeles station.\n\nCriminal justice news outlet the Appeal reports that according to the lawsuit, the group uses violence and intimidation to maintain a \"stranglehold on the unincorporated communities east of downtown,\" with members sporting \"tattoos featuring a pistol-wielding, sombrero- and bandolier-wearing skeleton with a thick mustache and a unique number for each member.\" In 2018, the outlet noted that the existence of nearly three dozen federal civil rights lawsuits against the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department pointed to a deputy \"gang culture that encourages excessive force, particularly against minorities.\"\n\nThe September lawsuit also argues that the existence of the Banditos - and of other similar groups in the county - have negatively impacted deputies, even as Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva argues that the groups are little more than \" intergenerational hazing .\"\n\n\"The sheriff is trying to wrongfully minimize the impact of these gangs,\" Vincent Miller, the attorney representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, told the Appeal this week. The result, the lawsuit argues, is that the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department has a culture that \"is warped and off track.\"\n\nThe 63-page lawsuit accuses the Banditos - a male-only, predominantly Latino clique, who the FBI is also watching - of targeting, harassing, and intimidating other Latino officers not in the group, as well as civilians. The plaintiffs in the suit say they have been met with retaliation for filing complaints against members of the Banditos and their associates, saying that criticism of the Banditos resulted in nonaffiliated officers being left without backup in dangerous situations, subjected to harassment, forced into unpaid shifts and last-minute dispatches, and in at least one instance from 2018, assaulted by other deputies during an off-duty party.\n\n\"Due to the illegal policing practices by the Banditos gang, and its culture which dominates the station, the numbers of stops and arrests of community members in East Los Angeles are excessive,\" the lawsuit says. \"The East Los Angeles station also generates an inordinate number of lawsuits, harassment claims, and acts of violence, including violence against fellow deputies.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also highlights behavior from Banditos members and their \"associates,\" arguing that there is a clear pattern of misconduct from those tied to the group. Furthermore, the suit, which also names Villanueva as a defendant (but notes that he is not actually a Banditos member), claims that department leadership has failed to take action against the deputy clique and has instead rehired several members after they were fired for misconduct.\n\nIn other incidents, the plaintiffs claim that those connected to the gangs are given special protection from lawsuits and criminal prosecution in the first place. Here's how the Appeal describes an incident involving a female officer allegedly associated with the group:\n\nIn 2017, according to the lawsuit, Deputy Carrie Robles-Plascencia ran a red light in a patrol vehicle, which left two children dead and their mother seriously injured. The lawsuit alleges that Sheriff Villanueva \"buried\" an Internal Affairs investigation into the incident because he has a personal relationship with Robles-Plascencia, and she calls Villanueva \"dad\" and his wife \"mom.\"\n\nOther harassment lawsuits have also focused on the Banditos. In 2014, for example, a female deputy was given $1.5 million in a settlement after filing a lawsuit claiming that she was harassed by members of the Banditos. The deputy said she was specifically singled out after refusing to go along with their \"traditions and initiation rituals\" and that she faced retaliation for refusing to give sexual favors to Banditos-affiliated deputies.\n\nCritics of officer groups like the Banditos argue that the group builds off a decades-long phenomenon of bad behavior within officer cliques in Los Angeles County.\n\n\"The problem is more unique to LASD than their management would like to admit,\" Sean Kennedy, a Loyola Law School professor and member of the Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission, told Witness LA , a local news outlet, in September. \"The failure of elected L.A. Sheriffs to do anything affirmative to investigate the internal gangs is likely one of the major reasons that they have persisted for so long.\"\n\nThere have been other groups before the Banditos, several of them involved in controversial police violence incidents.\n\nIn the 1990s, for example, a deputy group called the Lynwood Vikings , described by a California judge as a \"neo-Nazi, white supremacist gang,\" was responsible for incidents that led to millions being handed out in lawsuit settlements, and was also the subject of a 1991 lawsuit from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The case later led to the 1992 Kolts report, which called for station commanders to \"root out and punish severely any lingering gang-like behavior by its deputies.\"\n\nMore than two decades later, one of the Vikings members, a former LASD assistant sheriff named Paul Tanaka, was convicted and sentenced to serve five years in prison in 2016 for conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges following a federal probe into reports of civil rights violations and abuse in the Los Angeles County Jail system.\n\nOther deputy groups, with names like the \"Jump Out Boys,\" \"Regulators,\" and \"Grim Reapers\" have also been involved in controversial incidents with civilians and other officers. And some cliques, like groups called the \"2000 Boys\" and \"3000 Boys,\" have been known to operate out of the county jail. According to a September 2012 report from LA County's Citizens' Commission on Jail Violence, the 2000 Boys made assaulting incarcerated men part of recruitment, with the report noting that \"a deputy reportedly fractured the orbital bone of a non-combative inmate to 'earn his ink.'\"\n\nAnd in 2018, the sheriff's department faced a lawsuit from the family of Donta Taylor, a 31-year-old black man killed by deputies in a 2016 Compton shooting. Taylor's family argued that the deputies involved in the shooting were part of a violent clique. During a 2018 deposition, one of the deputies, Samuel Aldama, admitted that he shared a tattoo with other officers in the department; the same deputy also said that he had \"ill feelings\" toward African Americans. The lawsuit was settled in June of this year, with Taylor's family receiving $7 million .\n\nThe actions of the different groups have led critics to argue that the LASD is not doing enough to stop the activity of deputy cliques. But Villanueva, the current sheriff who campaigned in 2018 on a promise to reform the department , says the groups are not actually the problem, instead arguing that the issue is the behavior of individual officers. He's also said the department can't do anything about the officer's shared tattoos, saying that they are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBut some experts, like Kennedy, the Loyola professor, say this is a weak argument . Meanwhile, the eight deputies serving as plaintiffs in the current lawsuit argue that Villanueva is actually enabling the activity that he promised to reform. In recent months, the sheriff has announced a new policy that prohibits LASD deputies from participating in groups that violate the rights of civilians or other deputies. He has also pointed to the fact that several officers have been transferred from the East LA station.\n\nCritics counter that many of these changes were simply the result of organic officer transfers and did not actually aim to dismantle the Banditos.\n\nThe new lawsuit seeks to have the department take additional actions to address the deputy cliques in the hope that it will prompt an overhaul of the entire system. But given how these groups have allegedly thrived in LA County for decades, it may take much more than one lawsuit for things to change.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nHow America's opioid crisis became a foreign policy issue.\n\nHow we design prisons and where we choose to build them says a lot about what we think of the people on the inside.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nRichard Glossip had everything going for him in his Supreme Court hearing.

They have both been charged with sale of narcotic drugs, possession of narcotic drugs, possession of manufacturing equipment for narcotic drugs, possession of marijuana for sale and possession of a weapon in a drug offense -- all felonies.\n\nThe sheriff's office singled out the vape cartridges, especially in the wake of the current epidemic of illnesses in the country.\n\n\"These cartridges have been located throughout the country and have been associated with recent vaping deaths, were being manufactured in the residence,\" the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Wednesday announcing the arrests. \"Base (sic) on the equipment and the products located inside the residence, detectives believe this location was an apparent Closed Loop BHO Manufacturing Lab.\"\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has specifically warned consumers against using THC-infused vaping products.\n\n\"In many cases of illness reported by the states, patients have acknowledged recent use of THC-containing vaping products while speaking to healthcare personnel, or in follow-up interviews by health department staff,\" according to an FDA release from Sept. 6.\n\nIn addition to the THC vaping cartridges, the pair was apparently extracting cannabis and adding it to snack food to sell. Among the products were \"Weedos,\" \"Sour Dab Kids\" and \"Weed Thins.\"\n\nPolice said they were tipped off to the drug house, and then conducted surveillance on the residence for days before getting a warrant.\n\n\"We are focused on protecting the young adults in our community,\" Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone said. \"We will not tolerate criminal activity targeting adolescence for profit and at the expense of health.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office also seized a boat and an ATV from the residence.\n\nA vote to legalize recreational use of marijuana failed in Arizona in 2016, though users would only have been able to possess an ounce legally. The 300 pounds found by authorities in the Phoenix home is 4,800 ounces.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Ariz. sheriffs seek new probe in gun case\n\n&#151; -- A majority of Arizona's county sheriffs on Friday called upon President Obama to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the government's botched gun-smuggling case known as Operation Fast and Furious.\n\nAt a Phoenix news conference, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu said the sting operation, which allowed an estimated 2,000 firearms to reach narcotics cartels in Mexico, was a betrayal that should lead to the removal of Attorney General Eric Holder and possible criminal charges against those responsible.\n\n\"I believe that this is a much larger scandal than what took place in Watergate,\" said Babeu, who is president of the Arizona Sheriff's Association.\n\nThe Fast and Furious case, based in Arizona and carried out by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, was designed to catch high-level drug lords responsible for the illegal transport of guns into Mexico.\n\nWeapons were sold legally to front buyers who, in some cases, were placed under surveillance in hopes of tracking the firearms to cartel operatives. Instead, most of the guns were smuggled into Mexico unfettered, where they have been traced to dozens of crime scenes.\n\nATF whistleblowers first exposed the practice after U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was killed in a December shootout with banditos near Nogales, Ariz., involving a pair of semi-automatic rifles that traced back to Operation Fast and Furious. Their revelations led to congressional hearings in which agents and Justice Department officials have been criticized for evasive and dishonest testimony.\n\nTo date, the scandal has forced the replacement of ATF administrator Ken Melson; reassignment of the bureau's top Arizona agent, William Newell; and the resignation of Dennis Burke, former U.S. Attorney for Arizona.\n\nObama and Holder have asserted that they were not aware that federal agents allowed hundreds of guns to \"walk\" into Mexico until the whistleblower complaints were made public this year.\n\n\"He's (Holder) indicated that he was not aware of what was happening in Fast and Furious; certainly I was not,\" Obama said during a Thursday news conference. \"And I think both he and I would have been very unhappy if somebody had suggested that guns were allowed to pass through that could have been prevented by the United States of America.\n\n\"He has assigned an Inspector General to look into how exactly this happened, and I have complete confidence in him and I've got complete confidence in the process to figure out who, in fact, was responsible for that decision and how it got made.\"\n\nBut Babeu said he suspects a cover-up has protected high-level officials in the Justice Department and White House. He also said that he believes Holder was not forthright in testimony before a congressional committee.\n\n\"The fact that he knew about this before the murder of Agent Terry should haunt him,\" Babeu said. \"Eric Holder, in my opinion, should resign or he needs to be fired. . . . Nobody in America is above the law, including Eric Holder, including President Obama. There is no king.\"\n\nDuring a news conference Friday in Washington, Holder defended his testimony as truthful and accurate. In a letter to key Democrats and Republicans in Congress who oversee Justice Department issues, he repeated that he was not told about Operation Fast and Furious before details became public this year.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
