A growing number of defendants appear to be embracing rhetoric spread by Trump, giving defiant speeches in court, repeating his false election claims and portraying themselves as patriots.\n\nDuring a recent court hearing, Proud Boys member Marc Bru repeatedly insulted and interrupted the judge, who ultimately sentenced him to six years in prison. \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again,\" Bru said.\n\nAt least two other rioters shouted \"Trump won!\" in court after receiving their punishment.\n\nSome people charged in the riot are pinning their hopes on a Trump victory in November.\n\nRachel Marie Powell, a Pennsylvania woman who was sentenced to nearly five years in prison for smashing a Capitol window, told a CNN reporter that the 2024 presidential election is \"like life or death\" for her. She said she believes she will get out of prison if Trump is elected.\n\nThe rhetoric resonates with the strangers who donate money to Jan. 6 defendant's online campaigns, but it isn't earning them any sympathy from the judges. Judges appointed by presidents from both political parties have described the riot as an affront to democracy and they repeatedly have admonished defendants for not showing true remorse or casting themselves as victims.\n\nOver more than three years, judges have watched hours of video showing members of the mob violently shoving past overwhelmed officers, shattering windows, attacking police with things such as flagpoles and pepper spray and threatening violence against lawmakers. In court hearings, officers have described being beaten, threatened and scared for their lives as they tried to defend the Capitol.\n\nBefore sentencing a Kentucky man, who already had a long criminal record, to 14 years in prison for attacking police with pepper spray and a chair, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta admonished the man for propagating \"the lie that what's happening here in Washington, D.C., is unfair and unjust.\"\n\n\"You are not a political prisoner,\" Mehta, who was nominated by President Barack Obama told Peter Schwartz. \"You're not Alexei Navalny,\" the judge said referring to the imprisoned Russian opposition leader. \"You're not somebody who is standing up against injustice, who's fighting against an autocratic regime. ... You're somebody who decided to take the day into his own hands, much in the same way that you have used your hands against others for much of your life.\"\n\nLamberth's scathing remarks came in the case of James Little, a North Carolina man who was not accused of any violence or destruction during the riot and pleaded guilty only to a misdemeanor offense. Lamberth didn't name the people responsible for what the judge called \"shameless\" attempts to rewrite history. But Trump has closely aligned himself with rioters during his presidential campaign. He has described them as \"hostages,\" called for their release from jail and pledged to pardon a large portion of them if he wins the White House in November.\n\nRoughly 750 people charged with federal crimes in the riot have pleaded guilty and more than 100 others have been convicted at trial. Many rioters were charged only with misdemeanor offenses akin to trespassing while others face serious felonies such as assault or seditious conspiracy. Of those who have been sentenced, roughly two-thirds have received some time behind bars, with terms ranging from a few days of intermittent confinement to 22 years in prison, according to data compiled by The Associated Press .\n\nLamberth had originally sentenced Little in 2022 to 60 days behind bars, followed by three years of probation. But Washington's federal appeals court sided with Little on appeal, ruling he could not be sentenced to both prison time and probation. When Little's case returned to Lamberth's court, the judge resentenced him to 150 days - with credit for time already served in jail and on probation - citing the man's claims of persecution and efforts to downplay the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"Little cannot bring himself to admit that he did the wrong thing, although he came close today,\" Judge Lamberth wrote. \"So it is up to the court to tell the public the truth: Mr. Little's actions, and the actions of others who broke the law on Jan. 6, were wrong. The court does not expect its remarks to fully stem the tide of falsehoods. But I hope a little truth will go a long way.\"\n\nAn attorney for Little declined to comment on Lamberth's remarks.\n\nIn other cases, judges have said their sentence must send a message when rioters have promoted the notion that they are being unfairly prosecuted for their political views. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper told Richard \"Bigo\" Barnett, the Arkansas man who propped his feet on a desk in then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office in a widely circulated photo, that he seemed to enjoy the notoriety of becoming one of the faces of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"You have made yourself one of the faces of J6 not just through that photo but using your platform and your notoriety to peddle the misconception that you and other J6ers are somehow political prisoners who are being persecuted for your beliefs as opposed to your conduct on Jan. 6,\" Cooper, an Obama appointee, told Barnett before sentencing him to more than four years in prison.\n\n\"So to all those folks that follow Bigo, they need to know that the actions of Jan. 6 cannot be repeated without some serious repercussions,\" the judge said.\n\n____\n\nRicher reported from Boston.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Jenkins, a Texas man who attacked the U.S. Capitol with a metal tomahawk and is now the face of a website selling merchandise portraying jailed rioters as \"political prisoners\", was sentenced on Friday, Oct. 6, 2023, to seven years behind bars. (Justice Department via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A Texas man who attacked the U.S. Capitol with a metal tomahawk - and is now the face of a website selling merchandise portraying jailed rioters as \"political prisoners\" - was sentenced Friday to seven years behind bars.\n\nShane Jenkins , 46, tried to smash a Capitol window with his tomahawk during the Jan. 6, 2021, siege. He also repeatedly threw makeshift weapons at police officers, hurling a desk drawer, a flagpole, a metal walking stick and a wooden pole with a spear-like point.\n\nA website touts Jenkins as the founder of a group that seeks to \"shed light on the January 6th defendants and the treatment they have faced from the government.\" The website sells T-shirts, hoodies, hats, tote bags and other merchandise with Jan. 6-themed slogans, including \"Free the J6 political prisoners\" and \"Want my vote? Help the J6ers.\" Another shirt for sale features former President Donald Trump's mugshot over the words \"Indicted we stand.\"\n\nThe website also commemorates Jenkins' own role in the riot. It displays a cartoon avatar of Jenkins, nicknamed Skullet, and a logo depicting crossed tomahawks below a silhouette of the Capitol building.\n\nProsecutors don't know how much money Jenkins has generated from the website's merchandise sales. But they said he has used another fundraising site to collect more than $118,000 in donations.\n\n\"Far from contemplating the harm he has caused, examining his conscience, feeling shame for his actions, and resolving to change, Jenkins has chosen to use his January 6 status to build a brand in order to garner money and attention,\" prosecutors wrote in a court filing .\n\nDefense attorney Dennis Boyle said Jenkins hasn't received money from the sale of Jan. 6 merchandise and doesn't own the site that sells it, although he couldn't say who does.\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, who sentenced Jenkins, said it was \"shameful\" for him to capitalize on his role in the riot. The judge also rejected the notion that Jenkins and other jailed rioters are political prisoners who can't get a fair trial.\n\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" Mehta said. \"It's all on video.\"\n\nJenkins expressed remorse for his actions on Jan. 6, saying he got \"caught up in the heat of the moment.\"\n\n\"I love this country,\" he told the judge. \"And I'm not some crazed maniac set out to destroy this nation.\"\n\nProsecutors had recommended a prison sentence of 19 years and eight months. They also asked the judge to impose a fine of at least $118,888, equaling the money Jenkins has publicly raised.\n\nMehta denied their request for a fine. He also refused to impose a \"terrorism\" enhancement that would have significantly increased his sentencing guidelines.\n\nIn March, a jury convicted Jenkins of charges including civil disorder and obstructing the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying the presidential election victory of Joe Biden, a Democrat, over Trump, a Republican.\n\nJenkins flew from Houston to Washington, D.C., a day before Trump's rally near the White House on Jan. 6. Jenkins believed baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from Trump and envisioned that a \"medieval melee style battle\" would erupt at the Capitol, prosecutors said.\n\n\"His language invoked imagery of war and violent retribution, and his goal was to intimidate and retaliate against a government that would not install his preferred candidate,\" they wrote.\n\nBoyle said Jenkins' actions on Jan. 6 were motivated by a \"misunderstanding about the election.\"\n\n\"There remain many grifters out there who remain free to continue propagating the 'great lie' that Trump won the election, Donald Trump being among the most prominent,\" Boyle wrote . \"Mr. Jenkins is not one of these individuals; he knows he was wrong.\"\n\nThe defense lawyer said Jenkins endured a tumultuous, abusive upbringing to became a \"pillar in his community.\" When he was 20, Jenkins shot and killed his stepfather in self-defense after the man pointed a shotgun at him and made death threats, according to Boyle, who said Jenkins wasn't charged in the 1997 killing.\n\nProsecutors acknowledged that Jenkins wasn't prosecuted for his stepfather's killing, but they said his \"extensive\" criminal record before Jan. 6 included assault convictions and shows he has a \"penchant for violence.\"\n\nIn July, Jenkins and 11 other inmates at the jail in Washington assaulted another Capitol riot defendant, Taylor Taranto , in a TV room, according to prosecutors. Taranto had been saying derogatory things about Ashli Babbitt , the rioter who was fatally shot by a police officer inside the Capitol, and Babbitt's mother, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors have argued that Jenkins played a pivotal role in the Jan. 6 attack. He struck a windowpane six times with the spike end of the tomahawk that he had carried in a backpack. He pulverized and sprayed the shatter-resistant glass.\n\n\"Are we going in or not?\" he shouted at the crowd.\n\nAfter Jenkins stepped down from the window ledge, another rioter stepped in to break the window.\n\n\"It is difficult to overstate the significance of Jenkins' actions at this location,\" prosecutors wrote. \"As the first to attack this window, Jenkins crossed a line that had previously not been crossed at the (Lower West Terrace) - he had attacked the Capitol itself.\"\n\nRioters eventually destroyed the window, allowing them to enter a conference room, where they made improvised weapons from the broken parts of wooden furniture. Mob members used the furniture pieces to attack police officers guarding an entrance in a tunnel on the Capitol's Lower West Terrace.\n\nMore than 1,100 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related federal crimes . Approximately 800 of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted by juries or judges after trials in Washington. Over 650 have been sentenced, with roughly two-thirds of them receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from three days to 22 years , according to an Associated Press analysis of court records.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Laura Ingraham's Excitement Over Trump's Jan. 6 Pardon Is A Really Sad About-Face\n\nGeneral Assignment Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWhat a difference four years makes.\n\nLaura Ingraham on Monday chirped about President Donald Trump 's massive pardon of Jan. 6 defendants ― a radical about-face from when the Fox News host relayed her horror at the attack on the Capitol as it happened. (Watch the video below.)\n\nAfter his swearing-in Monday, Trump granted clemency to about 1,500 people , including those convicted of violent crimes, who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn the election fairly won by former President Joe Biden .\n\nIn a chat with Fox News colleague Jesse Watters , Ingraham called the pardons \"really big\" as Trump checked off his to-do list on his first day back in office.\n\n\"1,600 pardons for J6ers who were arrested,\" Ingraham said. \"And a lot of them were sentenced to two, three, four, five years in jail. His point is, documents were destroyed, which they were, and these people never had the real chance to put on a proper defense. That was really big.\"\n\nIt's unclear which documents Ingraham was referring to, although the Supreme Court did issue an opinion that obstruction charges against some Jan. 6 defendants needed to include proof that they had destroyed or tampered with documents and evidence.\n\nIn summing up Trump's post-inauguration rush of executive orders and pardons, Ingraham exclaimed: \"This was the greatest hits of Donald Trump, and he enjoyed every minute.\"\n\nShe characterized Jan. 6 in far less buoyant terms as the siege unfolded.\n\nIn a text made public, Ingraham told Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows: \" The president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy.\"\n\nOn the air, she condemned those who broke the law but at times appeared to promote the conspiracy theory that antifa was behind the riots.\n\nLater, however, she completely whitewashed what had transpired, characterizing the attempted overthrow of the election as \" old ladies walking through the halls of Congress taking selfies \" in 2023.\n\nSo it was no surprise that as the GOP celebrated Trump's first night back in office, Ingraham appeared to celebrate his stroke-of-the-pen clemency for Jan. 6 convicts.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

They've suffered enough,\" Trump says in the video from one of his campaign speeches. \"I call them hostages. Some people call them prisoners. I call them hostages.\"\n\nMichael Fanone, a former Washington, D.C., police officer who suffered a heart attack after being repeatedly tasered by one of Trump's followers on Jan. 6, said Americans cannot afford to forget what happened that day. \"Wake the fuck up, America,\" he told HuffPost. \"This is who Donald Trump is, a sick motherfucker who fetishizes violence committed on his behalf.\"\n\nTrump is listed as an invited speaker on The America Project's website, but it is unclear if he will attend the event. The reception is the same day that U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is scheduled to hold a hearing on the federal prosecution against Trump for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election he lost.\n\nTrump's campaign did not respond to HuffPost's queries about the fundraiser. A receptionist at Bedminster, however, confirmed that the event was scheduled but would not provide any further details to HuffPost.\n\nIt is also unclear what \"awards\" are to be handed out at the affair. The America Project did not respond to a query about the dinner. General admission tickets are listed at $1,500 on the group's website, with \"VIP\" tickets for sale at $2,500, while $50,000 buys a \"VIP Platinum table of 12,\" which includes hors d'oeuvres and a photo opportunity with actual \"J6ers.\"\n\nAlso unknown is whether Trump is donating the use of his golf club to the group or if America Project is paying rent and catering costs, which can run into the tens of thousands of dollars. When Trump's \"Save America\" political committee, which he uses to pay his legal bills, staged an event at Bedminster in May, for example, it paid $80,533.74 to the country club - the profits from which go directly into Trump's pocket.\n\nTrump, himself now a convicted felon from an unrelated case, has not made a secret of his support for the accused and convicted criminals who attacked the Capitol to coerce lawmakers into giving him a second term.\n\nHe participated in the release of a recording made by 20 of the most violent of the accused and convicted participants of the assault. Their rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" recorded by one of them in the District of Columbia jail, was interspliced with Trump's reading of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nTrump began playing the recording at his rallies in 2023, standing at attention as it came over the loudspeakers. At times, he has saluted during its playing.\n\nThe America Project is featuring the song at the fundraiser, even giving away a plaque memorializing the song's \"#1\" status as a door prize. \"Join us for an unforgettable evening as we honor and celebrate the twenty defendants who contributed to the powerful 'Justice For All' song, which quickly went Platinum on the Billboard Charts upon its release on March 3, 2023,\" the website states.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Trump Dangles 'Full Pardons' For Jan. 6 Defendants If He's Reelected\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nDonald Trump says he's \"looking very strongly\" at pardoning Jan. 6 defendants if he runs again for office and is reelected, but first he'd like his supporters to line his pockets.\n\nThe former president made the comments in an interview Thursday with Wendy Bell, a far-right media personality in Pennsylvania, where Trump-endorsed Republican Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz's campaign is struggling to gain traction .\n\n\"I will tell you, I will look very, very favorably about full pardons if I decide to run, and if I win,\" Trump said. \"I will be looking very, very strongly about pardons. Full pardons.\"\n\n\"And I mean full pardons with an apology,\" he added, expanding on the claim he first made in June .\n\nIt's unclear if Trump's list would include the numerous Republican congressmen who sought presidential pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nAmong them is Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who former Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann said requested a pardon that \"was as broad as you can describe ... for any and all things.\" Gaetz is currently under a federal investigation for alleged sex trafficking .\n\nThe violent mob at the U.S. Capitol that Trump incited on Jan. 6 killed five people, including one police officer, injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides. Trump hoped to use the violence to force Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost by 7 million popular votes.\n\nIn new interview, Trump says he met with J6ers recently and is \"financially supporting\" some of them. Then says if he wins re-election he will be \"looking very strongly at full pardons\" for all J6 defendants, \"with an apology\" from the govt. pic.twitter.com/xdIVEMt7Sf\n\nTrump also suggested that he's \"financially supporting\" some of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists ― though he stopped short of explicitly saying that, stating only that he's \"supporting people that are incredible.\"\n\nBell didn't dig into the assertion or ask for evidence to support the claim.\n\nAn email seeking comment from Trump's representatives regarding who exactly he's financially supporting, how they were selected, and where the purported money came from wasn't returned.\n\nAfter making the claim, Trump asked Bell's listeners to fork over money in support of the cause.\n\n\"I've studied it, I've studied cases, and contributions should be made,\" he said. \"We have to do that, because you know they have some good lawyers, but even the good lawyers ... you get some of these judges that are so nasty, and angry, and mean.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Steve Bannon Hypes Marjorie Taylor Greene For, Gulp, This Key Post Under Trump\n\nGeneral Assignment Reporter, HuffPost\n\nFormer Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon proposed the unthinkable for many Americans to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.): That she could be the new Homeland Security secretary under the president-elect.\n\n\"You're such a fighter,\" Bannon gushed on his \"War Room\" podcast early Wednesday after Trump won the election. \"Now, is there truth to the rumor that you're going to take over at DHS?\"\n\nThe far-right congresswoman has previously expressed interest in the job to help Trump carry out the mass deportations that he has threatened. So the notion, as frightening as it may be, was not out of left field.\n\nBut Greene, who was partying at Mar-a-Lago during the interview, laughed and didn't bite.\n\n\"I don't know what's going to happen, Steve,\" she replied. \"We're just thrilled to have President Trump back in the White House because everyone knows what that means. We're going to dismantle the deep state. We're going to end the weaponized government. We're going to pardon the J6ers. That's extremely important. And we are going to restore peace and prosperity back for the American people. And we're going to end those foreign wars and we're going to end the climate change scam. Everything's going to be restored. We're so excited.\"\n\nGreene has attacked Homeland Security under President Joe Biden .\n\nShe sponsored a resolution to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over his handling of the border. In April, the Senate voted to ditch all the impeachment charges for failing to meet the constitutional standard of \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"\n\nLately, Greene has been pushing her new conspiracy theory that \"they\" - apparently implying Democrats - can control extreme weather like Hurricane Helene.

      "text": "The Jan. 6 Vigil At DC Jail Is Not Going Away\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nFREEDOM CORNER - This patch of sidewalk in Southeast Washington, D.C., between the razorwire edifice of the D.C. jail and the rows of headstones in Congressional Cemetery, is a symbol of the Republican Party's possible future.\n\nEvery night inside the jail, Donald Trump supporters locked up for attacking the U.S. Capitol sing the national anthem. And every night at Freedom Corner, a small group of activists holding a vigil sings with them.\n\nOn several recent evenings, an inmate named Jeffrey Sabol, who pleaded guilty on Friday to attacking police during the riot, led the singing. Calling from inside the jail, Sabol's disembodied voice was audible through a smartphone speaker held up to a mic, drowning everyone else out. Except for the line \"our flag was STILL THERE,\" which everybody yells because the inmates are still there, and so are their supporters, out on the sidewalk every night.\n\nThey've been doing this vigil for a year, livestreaming every moment, united by false beliefs about the 2020 election and what happened on Jan. 6, 2021. And even though they've got regular antagonists and face complaints from neighbors, it looks like they're never going away, and the martyrdom of insurrectionists seems to be taking root as prescribed history for elected Republicans.\n\n\"We'll be here as long as we can,\" the group's leader, Micki Witthoeft, told HuffPost during Tuesday night's vigil. \"We made a commitment.\"\n\nWitthoeft is the mother of Ashli Babbitt , the 35-year-old Air Force veteran shot by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to climb through a barricaded door during the siege of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Witthoeft and her Freedom Corner regulars wear T-shirts with Babbitt's image that proclaim she was murdered.\n\nTrump has championed Witthoeft's cause, collaborating with the prisoners on a song, helping the gang raise money from online donors and even calling in to the vigil itself .\n\n\"We love Ashli, and it was so horrible what happened to her,\" Trump said through Witthoeft's phone during a vigil in September. \"We cannot allow this to happen to our country.\"\n\nWhen Republicans took control of the House of Representatives this year, Rep. Majorie Taylor Green (R-Ga.) gave Witthoeft a shout-out during the first meeting of the House Oversight Committee, saying Babbitt was murdered and likening her death to the brutal beating of Tyre Nichols during a traffic stop by police in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n\"I believe that there are many people that came into the Capitol on Jan. 6, whose civil rights and liberties are being violated heavily,\" Greene said from the dais during her first appearance as a committee member in January.\n\nThat week, I asked House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) if he agreed that Babbitt had been murdered or if he thought the police officer had done his job. Investigations by the Justice Department and the Capitol Police had cleared the officer of wrongdoing.\n\n\"I think the police officer did his job,\" McCarthy said.\n\nIt was one of the rare instances in which McCarthy strayed from Trump, and the former president immediately rebuked the speaker in a statement, calling the officer a \"thug\" and saying he \"was not just 'doing his job' when he shot and killed Great Patriot Ashli Babbitt at point blank range.\"\n\nIn an apparent effort to smooth things over, McCarthy received Witthoeft for a meeting in his office a few weeks later at her request. She said afterward that he had been \"delightful.\"\n\nWitthoeft said this week that she's met with a \"fair share\" of other House Republicans, though she declined to describe the meetings other than to say some members were supportive, some not. One of her Freedom Corner colleagues told HuffPost she's had sit-down meetings with more than two dozen lawmakers and more casual hallway encounters with perhaps another two dozen. A video posted last month shows Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) greeting Witthoeft and remembering she had previously been in his office.\n\n\"Thank you for what you're doing,\" Loudermilk said. \"We're going to keep going until we get the truth.\"\n\nLoudermilk has been leading a Republican counter-probe into the bipartisan special committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack, recently complaining that it failed to preserve all of its records and didn't investigate the Capitol's security failure that day. (A bipartisan Senate report concluded in 2021 that federal intelligence agencies failed to share warnings and that the Capitol Police were unprepared.)\n\nSeveral Republicans during a recent hearing with FBI Director Christopher Wray insinuated that undercover agents or confidential informants bore responsibility for the Capitol riot. Even more Republicans have wrapped themselves around Trump as he faces a criminal trial for trying to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, including by inciting the riot.\n\nGreene led a small contingent of lawmakers to the jail in March, where they received a tour and then decried the conditions inside. (Democrats who joined the tour said the J6 inmates, who are housed together , apart from the jail's general population, appeared to have a better setup than other inmates.) The visit was part of an investigation into the supposed mistreatment of the J6ers, but the committee has since given no indication that an investigation is still underway.\n\nWitthoeft and her compatriots don't appear to be losing any steam. The vigil celebrated its first anniversary at the beginning of the month, and I told Witthoeft I had heard that she and a few others recently rented a house in Northeast D.C.\n\n\"We do have a team at the Eagle's Nest,\" Witthoeft said.\n\n\"Eagle's Nest,\" I said, making sure I heard her correctly.\n\n\"Which some would say was Hitler's hideout, but we're American citizens and we won that war and we're taking back the name,\" she said. \"That is absolutely not an ode to Hitler.\"\n\nPreviously, they'd been staying at shorter-term Airbnb rentals, but they've been able to move in thanks to online donations from livestream viewers and other supporters. Various websites affiliated with the cause solicit donations for commissary funds for inmates and also for living expenses for Witthoeft and her team.\n\n\"We're D.C. residents now,\" said Tommy Tatum, a 47-year-old Mississippi native who was at the Capitol during the riot and now resides at the Eagle's Nest.\n\nTatum said he managed radio stations in the years leading up to the coronavirus pandemic, at which point he said he quit so he could blog about local Black Lives Matter protests and local crime. A friend asked if he wanted to see Trump's speech on Jan. 6, so he threw in $50 for gas and they arrived in Washington early that morning. He made his way to the Capitol after the speech and arrived on the West Front Plaza, which he said looked like a war zone. He said he yelled at police but didn't assault them. Video from his perspective, memorialized on Twitter by one of his many online haters, suggests he was very much in the fray, yelling at police and encouraging other rioters to \"take their helmets,\" though the footage doesn't show him throwing any punches.\n\nThe attack on the Capitol, Tatum said, only interrupted the official challenge to the election that was underway in the House and Senate ― one he insists could have ended with Trump rightfully winning the election.\n\n\"I believe it was instigated by some pro-Marxist demonstrators along with some government actors,\" he said. \"It was about specifically stopping the process that would allow Donald Trump to attain the presidency, per the Constitution.\"\n\nThe vigil's closest neighbor is Congressional Cemetery, a privately operated historical site that hosts events and where neighbors pay for the privilege of running their dogs on the grounds.\n\nVigil-goers have often set food and candles on the cemetery's northeast wall, and their music and noise carry onto the grounds, prompting neighbors to complain to the cemetery. One of the J6 regulars admitted in a video in April that he and others had made a habit out of peeing in the cemetery at night, though he said they no longer did so; another video from April shows the activists jawing with a dog walker.\n\n\"We're on the phone with people constantly, and nothing gets done, and it's beyond frustrating for us because we are de facto their background whenever they film, whenever they do anything, and so everybody associates our cemetery with them,\" Jackie Spainhour, the cemetery's president, said in an interview.\n\nThe most serious offense was probably the pirate flag a vigil attendee attached to the cemetery wall with a noose attached to the flag . Spainhour has pleaded with D.C. police for help dealing with the group, but it appears that law enforcement has no desire to shut the protest down.\n\n\"We're still trying to figure out where their First Amendment rights end and our rights as private property owners begin, and it's just becoming extremely frustrating,\" Spainhour said.\n\nOn Aug. 1, the vigil celebrated its first anniversary with a \"block party\" that drew counterprotesters - a common-enough occurrence that D.C. police have installed barriers to keep the two groups on opposite sides of the street. A highlight reel posted online by one of the anti-vigil activists shows some of the nasty heckling and physical confrontations that went down before the barricades went up. Officers arrested Witthoeft in May following a scuffle, but no charges resulted.\n\nOn recent evenings, there have been a half-dozen police cars parked with their lights on during the evening livestreams, with the officers remaining in their vehicles and driving away after the stream wraps up.\n\n\"The Metropolitan Police Department respects everyone's First Amendment right to demonstrate and peacefully protest,\" an MPD spokesman said in an email.\n\nOn a typical night, it's just the J6ers. They unfold a table, fire up a generator, and pipe music and commentary through a loudspeaker. Some nights there's pizza or fried chicken, and if it's raining, they'll unfold a party tent. At 9 p.m., they get a D.C. jail inmate on the phone, put him on speaker, and join in singing the national anthem. Then they chat for a few more minutes, essentially turning Freedom Corner into an open-air talk radio program. The vigil wraps up each night with the gang swaying arm-in-arm to Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the U.S.A.\"\n\nOn the day Trump was indicted for his efforts to overturn the election, the group seemed glad that the former president had finally joined the club he started. On another evening, the still-imprisoned Sabol sounded thrilled that Trump had recently shared and praised an interview with a woman espousing a QAnon conspiracy theory claiming Biden is only president of a bankrupt corporation and that the U.S. Space Force, founded under Trump, had evidence of election fraud, and that Trump had only withheld it because the country wasn't ready for the civil war that would ensue.\n\n\"The big punch is that Trump is saying, 'Hey, I praised this woman for what she's saying in this interview, which is obviously an endorsement,'\" Sabol said to the group from inside the jail. \"It adds such a tremendous stamp of, 'This isn't B.S.'\"\n\nHow long can this go on? Well, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, there are 39 Capitol rioters detained by the city, of whom four are being held post-sentencing, 15 are awaiting trial and 20 have been convicted and are awaiting sentencing. Some of their trial dates are set for next year. So Freedom Corner will have a reason to continue at least until those defendants are tried, sentenced and sent off to a federal prison somewhere else.\n\nSome vigil regulars live out of their vehicles. Steve Jericho, a 60-year-old from Pennsylvania present at the vigil on weeknights, said he sleeps in a van that he parks around the city. He said he makes enough money working on houses two months per year to pay for the van lifestyle the rest. He regrets that he wasn't in the city on Jan. 6 itself, he said.\n\nOn weekends, Jericho posts up outside a federal prison in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, where some J6ers are serving time.\n\n\"Everywhere they put a J6er, there's going to be a vigil,\" Jericho said.\n\nAnother van-dweller and Freedom Corner regular named Taylor Taranto was arrested in June near former President Barack Obama's home in Northwest D.C. Police found guns and ammo in Taranto's van after he made what prosecutors called \"concerning statements\" about attacking the government.\n\nJericho and Tatum said they had noticed Taranto behaving erratically in the weeks before his arrest, and Tatum said he had asked Taranto to leave partly because he had heard Taranto say he didn't even believe Babbitt had died at the Capitol ― that her death was a hoax.\n\n\"He started acting like a weirdo in our group,\" Jericho said. \"And that was not cool.\"\n\nWhen I'd arrived at Freedom Corner on Tuesday evening, Witthoeft had been walking alone along the sidewalk, yelling back at three people who'd been taunting her from inside the cemetery. A counterprotester across the street later speculated through a bullhorn that she had scoliosis and needed to see a chiropractor because she appeared to be leaning to one side. (One of the weird things about the vigil is that the J6ers and their antagonists often seem very familiar with each other; it doesn't diminish the hostility at all.)\n\nAmid all the conspiracy theorizing and the general craziness of the vigil, and the alternate reality for which it stands, Witthoeft made a statement that evening about her dead daughter that was plaintive and self-aware.\n\n\"Whatever you think she was guilty of that day, she was an American citizen. She was a veteran. She was deployed four times to the Middle East,\" she said. \"She was an unarmed American citizen gunned down by her government, and she has a right to justice and the truth.\"\n\nIt was a useful reminder that above all else, this whole thing is sad."

      "text": "Twitter Users Have Questions About Trump's Jan. 6 Pardon Plan: 'Isn't That Sedition?'\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nDonald Trump's admission that he's \"looking very strongly\" at pardoning Jan. 6 defendants if he runs for the presidency again had a lot of Twitter users asking questions.\n\nMainly: How legal is that?\n\nOn Thursday, the former president told Pennsylvania-based conservative broadcaster Wendy Bell that he will \"look very, very favorably about full pardons\" if he decides to run and actually wins.\n\n\"I will be looking very, very strongly about pardons. Full pardons,\" Trump said, adding that those \"full pardons\" would come with an apology.\n\nHe also claimed he was \"financially supporting\" some Jan. 6 insurrectionists.\n\nThat's potentially good news for Trump supporters who participated in the Capitol riots, but Trump is a notorious liar ; he's previously promised to pay the legal fees of his more aggressive supporters , only to reverse course .\n\nIn new interview, Trump says he met with J6ers recently and is \"financially supporting\" some of them. Then says if he wins re-election he will be \"looking very strongly at full pardons\" for all J6 defendants, \"with an apology\" from the govt. pic.twitter.com/xdIVEMt7Sf\n\nHere's what Twitter users had to say about Trump's plan:\n\nSo, if you are meeting with seditionists and giving them money and promising them pardons which could be seen as obstruction of justice and support for further anti-government violence...isn't that, um, sedition? https://t.co/XBTALURFaA\n\nCoup leader pledges relief to his assistants https://t.co/V6y8KMRa7B\n\nBut this isn't fascism, right? https://t.co/RCqafONDMX\n\nIf Trump is elected, he'll apologize to the J6 traitors because the Capitol police got in the way of their bats, poles, stun guns and bear spray. https://t.co/O3yDuONSfk\n\nSo the former president just promised to pardon the insurrectionists of January 6 when he gets back in office, I don't know maybe that's newsworthy https://t.co/5afJc6Y78e\n\nBasically. An endorsement of political violence. From the side foaming at the mouth about being called semi-fascists. https://t.co/7QVj6372jz\n\nTrump admits to funding the people who violently attacked the capitol in a criminal conspiracy to overturn the results of the election. Also, he wants to pardon them and wants America to apologize to them. https://t.co/YPaaQ03lXg\n\nAs always, Trump's view is \"alegal\" - \"unconcerned with legal and illegal.\" If someone commits a crime to help him, he sees that as a good act, not a bad one. It is an act to help him, and therefore it is good. https://t.co/mrt1riq1kn https://t.co/IUrT6gEkZb\n\nOne person thought the issue was serious enough that all Republican candidates should be pressed on their own possible pardon plans.\n\nIt's reasonable to believe that most Republican candidates in 2024 will dangle pardons for the January 6th rioters as a way to curry favor with Trump's base. They should all be asked about that, repeatedly, until they answer clearly. https://t.co/6uTnCk7IqY\n\nAnd another Twitter user suggested things are so bad for Trump that it's unlikely he'll ever have a chance to pardon the Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "How Did Laura Loomer Finally Earn A Spot At Donald Trump's Side?\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIn May, the anti-Muslim bigot and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer spent a couple of days with a Washington Post reporter , trying to arrange a casual run-in with Donald Trump.\n\nLoomer, a fierce loyalist of the former president, had staked her hopes on landing a job in a future Trump White House. She wanted to demonstrate for the reporter and the world that \"Trump likes me,\" as she told the Post, and that she could get past his inner circle of campaign staff, who apparently saw her \"as a liability\" in their effort to make Trump seem less extreme, according to the paper.\n\nLoomer failed. It seemed she was too toxic - even for a brief encounter with Trump. The Post reporter left Florida without a photo of the pair together.\n\nHow times have changed.\n\nStarting last Tuesday, Loomer has regularly been spotted by Trump's side on the campaign trail, repeatedly flying with him around the country. She accompanied him to the presidential debate against Kamala Harris and was backstage at the debate with Trump's entourage. She was in Trump's posse in New York City and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 11 - despite sharing a video that claimed \"9/11 was an Inside Job!\" just last year .\n\n\"Donald Trump likes me,\" Loomer said Saturday. \"Donald Trump trusts me. OK? Obviously, he trusts me if I'm on his plane.\"\n\nTrump spilling the beans & telling everyone I'm actually a softie. I'll always stand by President Trump. He is simply the best. We don't deserve him. Everyday I pray for his protection, & I pray that we get him back into the White House. I pray for that everyday. #Trump2024 pic.twitter.com/XXsK69UGSU\n\nThe admission to Trump's inner circle is a remarkable come-up for Loomer, who has made a brand out of being openly racist, calling herself a \"proud Islamophobe\" and \"pro-white nationalism.\"\n\nLoomer has, for years, been a vile and unapologetic bigot, repeatedly calling for ethnically cleansing the U.S. of Muslims, referring to Black politicians by racist slurs and pushing the \"Great Replacement,\" the conspiracy theory that has inspired multiple white supremacist mass shootings.\n\nTrump had certainly associated with Loomer in the past - praising her , promoting her posts on social media, even shouting out her doomed 2020 congressional campaign, when Loomer was the Republican nominee to represent Mar-a-Lago's district in the House of Representatives.\n\nBut Trump's people knew to keep her at arm's length. Last year, when Trump had decided to give Loomer a job on his campaign, several people \"familiar with\" the story leaked the news to The New York Times , saying they were worried about \"backlash.\" Loomer never got the job.\n\nIn its May profile, when the Post reported that Loomer was friendly with some of Trump's staff, it added that \"no one wanted to discuss Loomer on the record.\" And when Loomer recalled riding on Trump's Boeing 757 three times in the past, the Post made sure to note, \"aides recall only two.\"\n\nRep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.), whom Loomer unsuccessfully ran against in 2020, called it \"shocking\" that she's now keeping company with Trump.\n\n\"Four years ago, the things she said were awful, inhumane, crazy,\" Frankel said Monday, citing Loomer's past claims that the 2018 Parkland high school shooting victims were crisis actors , as well as Loomer's ugly attacks on Muslims.\n\n\"She's only associated with the best of the extreme, or, well, the worst of the extreme,\" said the Florida congresswoman. \"Many, many people in this world are called 'a little nutty' or 'extreme.' But you'd never think they were advising the president of the United States.\"\n\nWhat changed between May and last week? The comedian Bill Maher had one salacious theory , but HuffPost decided to examine what Loomer has said and done to finally win a spot at Trump's side.\n\nIf her public statements over the past year have one thing in common, it's loyalty. Loomer has made elaborate displays of her allegiance to the former president. She has called for the execution of Trump's political enemies, said a judge overseeing one of Trump's criminal trials should be deported and pushed multiple conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.\n\nHere's a timeline, much of which comes from Media Matters, the liberal media watchdog group that has long documented Loomer's fascist histrionics.\n\nOn Telegram, the encrypted messaging app popular among right-wing extremists, Loomer writes in genocidal terms about Palestinians in Gaza: \"For the sake of humanity and what is righteous and good in the war on evil, Israel must level GAZA, flatten it into a parking lot, and then glass it. ... Their entire existence revolves around hating and killing Jews. There is no peace with these people.\"\n\nDuring an episode of her show on Rumble, the live-streaming video platform also popular among right-wing extremists, Loomer calls for purging Palestinian Americans from the U.S. government, namely Maher Bitar, a member of President Joe Biden's National Security Council, calling him one of many \"Islamic infiltrators in our government.\"\n\n\"Do you think that it's acceptable to have a hostile Muslim in charge of our intel in this country?\" Loomer asked. \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), which has also become a cesspool of right-wing extremism after its takeover by billionaire Elon Musk, Loomer commemorates the three-year anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by pushing multiple conspiracy theories, including that the riots were an \"inside job\" perpetrated by \"the FBI and other deep state bad actors\" as a way of tarnishing Trump.\n\nThe rioters arrested for their part in the insurrection, Loomer says, are \"patriots\" and \"political prisoners.\"\n\n\"Personally, I think J6 should be a national holiday in which we celebrate the bravery of American patriots who protested a stolen election,\" Loomer writes. \"Today, please keep the J6 political prisoners and their families in your thoughts and prayers. We need to keep fighting for these patriots. And most importantly we need to make sure we get Donald Trump elected again in 2024, because he's the only person who is going to pardon the J6ers.\"\n\nWriting on X, Loomer accuses the wife of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis - then one of Trump's Republican primary opponents - of \"fake crying about having cancer.\" Casey DeSantis was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021, received chemotherapy, and was later declared cancer-free by her doctors.\n\nA week before the GOP presidential caucus in Iowa, Loomer speculates on X about whether a snowstorm forecast to hit the state was the result of \"weather manipulation\" perpetrated by the \"deep state\" and Nikki Haley, one of Trump's primary opponents.\n\n\"Is the Deep State using HAARP to rig the Iowa Caucus?\" she writes, referring to the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program , a military project researching the weather which has long been the subject of unhinged conspiracy theories, including from InfoWars' Alex Jones (a longtime Loomer ally).\n\n\"Looks like weather manipulation to me,\" Loomer writes. \"Take a look at this weather radar below, and how the incoming snow storm accelerated out of nowhere.\"\n\nLoomer, speaking on Rumble, calls Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Black woman serving in Congress, a \"black dog\" whose \"district is literally Somalia.\" Omar, a Muslim and Somali American, has long been the target of vitriolic bigotry from Trump and others in the MAGA universe, but Loomer goes further than most.\n\nLoomer says that she \"really does believe in IQ science\" - a euphemism for race science, the belief that certain races are inherently superior to others - and that \"some of the people that have the lowest IQs are Somalis,\" who she claims are \"so inbred that they have an IQ that is legally classified as mental retardation.\" She also falsely states that Omar's relatives \"sleep in caves and have sex with goats.\"\n\nOmar's Somali immigrant constituents, Loomer rants, are \"modern-day jihadi welfare queens\" who are \"breeding like rabbits.\"\n\n\"I guess they've never heard of something called birth control,\" Loomer says. \"Unfortunate for us. Unfortunate for Western civilization.\"\n\nOn Rumble, Loomer says that \"people like\" Mehdi Hasan - the popular former MSNBC news host who happens to be Muslim and a critic of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza - need to be forcibly deported from the U.S.\n\n\"He is absolutely despicable, and people like him need to be removed from this country, OK?\" Loomer says. \"They need to be purged from this country because we have a national security problem in this country, and we need to purge and deport all jihadists and their sympathizers from this country, or else we're gonna have another 9/11 on steroids ... And I know that Republicans are scared because they don't wanna be called an Islamophobe, and they don't wanna be called anti-Muslim, and they don't wanna be called all these things. I don't care.\"\n\nOn Rumble, Loomer pushes the so-called Great Replacement theory - the white supremacist belief that immigration into the U.S. and European countries amounts to an extinction-level event for white people. The racist conspiracy theory has been cited in the writings of multiple white supremacist mass shooters, including in the \"manifestos\" of the men who killed 51 Muslim people at mosques in New Zealand, 22 mostly Latino people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas; and 11 Jewish worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue.\n\nLoomer warns that \"Third Worlders from shitholes\" are \"replacing us,\" adding: \"This is a replacement strategy, not just to replace white Americans and replace the majority population in our country, but also to replace our votes as American voters.\"\n\nOn Rumble, Loomer calls for the imprisonment of the secretaries of state who attempted to remove Trump from the presidential ballot over his multiple criminal indictments - attempts that ultimately failed after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\"And so, again, I don't care if people get offended by this, I have my two middle fingers up. One for Jena Griswold and one for Shenna Bellows tonight,\" Loomer says, referring to the secretaries of state for Colorado and Maine, respectively. \"And, you know, if I had more middle fingers, I would put them up too. But, that's where all of these communist secretaries of state who try to rig our elections, they belong in jail for election interference...\"\n\nAfter going on a long anti-immigrant rant, Loomer says it's likely that native-born Americans are going to resort to violence targeting those new to U.S. shores. \"I'm not gonna care when it happens...\" Loomer says. \"They're pushing people to the brink.\"\n\nLoomer hosts well-known white nationalist Peter Brimelow , of the racist organization VDare, on her Rumble show. During the course of the interview Loomer calls Vice President Harris, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and New York Attorney General Letitia James \"ghetto Black women\" and \"three angry Black women who are clearly targeting successful white men.\" (Willis had brought criminal charges against Trump in Georgia, and James had sued Trump and his organization for fraud.)\n\n\"There's a lot of angry Black women out there in positions of authority,\" Brimelow says in response. \"And there's a real question for whether they can be trusted.\"\n\nAppearing as a guest on Lauren Chen 's \"Pseudo-Intellectual LIVE,\" a far-right show streamed on YouTube, Loomer calls for a \" full-blown immigration moratorium ,\" arguing that \"nationalism keeps you safe. Profiling keeps you safe. Discrimination keeps you safe.\"\n\n\"I am against immigration,\" she says. \"I don't want any more immigration in my country right now.\"\n\nAppearing as a guest on the John Fredericks show on Rumble, Loomer lashes out at Jews who don't support Trump. Loomer, who is Jewish, is upset over college campus protests against the Israeli siege of Gaza - which has now killed over 40,000 Palestinians - equating the demonstrations with antisemitism. She's also upset at Democrats for offering even the mildest criticism of Israel's destruction of the occupied territory.\n\n\"If you're a Democrat and you're voting as a Jew or a Democrat, then you kind of deserve what's coming your way,\" Loomer says. \"These are like the Jews during the times of the Holocaust who assisted the Nazis because they thought that they were gonna be the last to go. These are like the kapo Jews of the Holocaust, John, who helped shovel Jews inside the gas chambers and shovel Jews inside the cable cars. OK? That's what these people are. That's basically what modern Democrat Jews are. They're kapo Jews. You might as well just go put yourself in a gas chamber yourself if this is how you're gonna behave. Because the crocodile might eat you last, but the crocodile is still going to eat you. And I don't care how inflammatory that sounds... If you're a Jew and you vote for Joe Biden and you do not vote for Donald Trump, then you kind of deserve what's coming your way. It's not going to be pleasant.\"\n\n(It bears repeating here that Loomer is a close friend and ally of white supremacist Nick Fuentes, who has openly expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and who has called for the execution of non-Christians , including \"perfidious Jews.\")\n\nIn a racist X post , Loomer calls Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), who is Black, \"GHETTO DEI SHANIQUA.\"\n\nWriting another racist screed on X, Loomer calls Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), who is also Black, a \"ghetto black woman who can barely speak English.\"\n\nOn Rumble, Loomer appears to double down on comments she made during an appearance on YouTuber Tim Pool's show calling for the execution of Democrats.\n\n\"If you are found guilty of treason, the punishment is death,\" Loomer says. \"I know that you're gonna clip what I said tonight, and you're gonna say, 'See, look. Laura Loomer did say she wants to execute Democrats.' No. I said that we need to follow the Constitution, and the Constitution outlines that if you are found guilty of treason, the punishment is death. And there's a lot of people, a lot of your friends, Joe Biden, a lot of your associates who would qualify for the death penalty.\"\n\nAfter Trump becomes the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes when a New York City jury finds him guilty on 34 charges related to a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels, Loomer calls for the judge in the trial, Juan Merchan, to be deported.\n\n\"Personally, I think that when Donald Trump gets elected to office again for a third time, he's gotta strip Juan Merchan of his citizenship and deport him back to the Third World hellhole he came from,\" Loomer says. \"I don't know. If you're in favor of Juan Merchan having his citizenship revoked and being deported back to Colombia, press one in the chat, because I would love to see Juan Merchan get deported back to Colombia where he came from.\"\n\nMerchan, a U.S. citizen, moved to the U.S. from Colombia when he was 6 years old.\n\nIn a series of racist posts on X, Loomer celebrates the death of Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), calling the progressive Black congresswoman a \"ghetto bitch.\"\n\n\"Even on her death bed, this ghetto bitch couldn't keep President Trump's name out of her disgusting mouth,\" Loomer writes, referring to some of the late congresswoman's final posts on X. \"I'd say rest in peace, but we all know lying democrats who have destroyed our country are going to hell. Sheila Jackson Lee will be remembered as a destructive force in America and one of the most low IQ members of Congress in the history of our nation.\"\n\n\"Good riddance,\" Loomer adds.\n\nIn a false and vicious post on Rumble, Loomer calls Harris a \"brain-dead bimbo who sucked so much cock in order to get to the political position that she's in today.\"\n\nAhead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Loomer spreads an outrageous rumor.\n\n\"I hear that a black, trans doctor will be performing an abortion on a white woman LIVE on stage at the DNC Convention in Chicago this August,\" Loomer writes on X.\n\nResponding to a video purportedly showing Venezuelan government forces firing on \"unarmed protesters,\" Loomer writes that \"Kamala Harris and @TheDemocrats will do the same thing to unarmed Americans if they steal the election this year.\"\n\n\"Never let the Democrats take away your guns,\" Loomer adds. \"I bet @KamalaHarris is already plotting on how she can murder as many Trump supporters as possible if she steals the election.\"\n\nIn an X post featuring Harris' birth certificate, Loomer falsely says the document shows that Harris \"is NOT black and never has been.\" The document shows Harris' father is Jamaican.\n\nLoomer says that Harris' pick of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as the Democratic vice presidential nominee is part of the \"Islamo-fascist communist takeover of the Western world and the United States of America.\" If Harris wins, Loomer tells her audience, \"we are going to have an Islamic caliphate in this country.\"\n\nLoomer writes in a racist post trafficking in stereotypes about South Asians that if Harris is elected president, \"the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call center and the American people will only be able to convey their feedback through a customer satisfaction survey at the end of the call that nobody will understand.\"\n\nAsked about Loomer's comments on \"Meet the Press,\" Vance - whose wife is Indian American - responds , \"I make a mean chicken curry, I don't think that it's insulting for anybody to talk about their dietary preferences or what they want to do in the White House.\"\n\n\"Do I agree with what Laura Loomer said about Kamala Harris?\" Vance adds later his answer. \"No, I don't. I also don't think that this is actually an issue of national import. Is Laura Loomer running for president? No. Kamala Harris is running for president, and whether you're eating curry at your dinner table or fried chicken, things have gotten more expensive thanks to her policies.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But don't be distracted by the sideshows: the MAGA right takes itself very seriously, and it's hard at work forming a transnational far-right alliance.\n\nConvention-goers at CPAC 2025. (Julian Feeld / Jacobin)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn the surface, this year's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was a garish pageant of jubilance and cruelty. But beneath this flashy exterior lurked something more serious: the outline of a transnational far-right coalition hell-bent on revenge.\n\nWhat I witnessed in Washington, DC, in late February was a Republican Party that, despite largely being in control of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the US government, is still pushing a spite-driven narrative of victimhood and retribution to galvanize its base. Rallying around Donald Trump as a figurehead, the MAGA right is on a mission to purge the federal government and the American political landscape of its perceived enemies. Don't be distracted by the carnival atmosphere: this political bloc takes itself very seriously, and it's hard at work forming alliances with like-minded groups in other countries.\n\nThe halls of the Gaylord National Convention Center were home to a cast of colorful characters in a celebratory mood. An elderly group of five in yellow sequin jackets with giant glittering red letters hanging around their necks that, when properly assembled, spelled TRUMP. A woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty with the words \"TRUMP TRIBE OF TEXAS\" on her dress. A photo booth flanked with red ring lights and a cardboard cutout of the president giving two thumbs up. Three tattooed millennial crypto investors calling themselves \"the Maga Boyz\" decked head to toe in matching stars and stripes.\n\nPeople cheered each other as they crossed paths. They enjoyed drinks and food in the giant atrium. They had won. It was time for a victory lap.\n\nFrequently, the celebratory energy veered into sadism. One man wore a Native American MAGA headdress, a taunt to the woke police. Another donned an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) jacket, lionizing the agency known for raiding workplaces and separating immigrant children from their parents. A photo backdrop labeled DEPORTATION CENTER depicted Trump and his new border czar, Tom Homan, standing in front of prison bars. Caged inside were Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Not pictured but implied were the millions of immigrants Trump has sworn to round up and deport.\n\nBut away from the lively expo floor and crowded halls, before the main events had even started, a more solemn gathering took place: the CPAC International Summit. There, foreign dignitaries and political figures sat around a U-shaped table to discuss the formation of what CPAC director Matt Schlapp called a \"global coalition.\" Present among them were ex-prime minister of the UK Liz Truss, the son of Brazilian ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, the head of a Mexican far-right party Eduardo Verástegui, the chairman of the Japanese Conservative Union Jay Aeba, and representatives of conservative organizations from Hungary, Korea, Australia, Italy, and Israel. Presiding over them was Steve Bannon, founder of the conservative outlet Breitbart , ex-chief strategist to Trump, and host of the War Room podcast.\n\nLong an advocate for a \"global populist movement\" - though the language he used at CPAC shifted to \"populist nationalist movement\" - Bannon has seen much of his vision come to life in Europe, where the far right has been gaining ground with anti-immigrant fervor. He now wants to use Trump's second term as an occasion to bring the movement's lessons home. He doesn't expect it to be easy. \"We're at war,\" he explained, with \"the deep state, the administrative state,\" and \"they don't think they've lost yet.\"\n\nBannon highlighted politicians like Bolsonaro (recently indicted for a coup plot) and South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol (currently being impeached for an attempted coup that saw him invoke martial law), comparing their struggles to those of Trump. Their enemies wanted them jailed and killed, Bannon warned. The solution, in his view, was to change the laws that have been used to prosecute far-right figures for their crimes.\n\nTo that end, he focused his speech on the far right's perceived legislative obstacles. \"They've got the judges. They've got courts,\" he told the gathering. \"They still have immense power. They still have the media.\" This month, Trump instructed the Justice Department to terminate all remaining Biden-era US attorneys and purged top military lawyers - indicating that he and Bannon are on the same page.\n\nThe International Summit highlighted the rise of a far-right transnational coalition, a concept cemented by the speakers on the main stage. They included president of the Spanish Vox party Santiago Abascal, Argentine president Javier Milei, UK politician Nigel Farage, and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni (who joined by video). Their speeches showed cohesion around several topics, one of which was \"Western civilization\" and its supposed pillars: Greek philosophy, Roman law, and Christian values. Common enemies, too, were invoked: \"Islamists,\" \"terrorists,\" \"illegal aliens,\" \"anti-Semites,\" and \"Communists.\" Lines about \"cancel culture\" and \"woke ideology\" almost felt ornamental compared to the venomous joy expressed at the idea of deporting, incarcerating, and killing people who belonged to these enemy categories.\n\nThe crowd at CPAC roared when they were shown an air strike on Somali jihadists, small grainy shapes in satellite images of a mountainside disappearing in a cloud of dust. Cheers erupted at the idea that thousands of criminals (including American citizens) would be deported and indefinitely held in a sprawling Salvadoran megaprison with the help of President Nayib Bukele. Support for the Israeli military intervention in Palestine - considered a genocide by Amnesty International and other human rights organizations - received raucous applause. Israeli politician Amichai Chikli told convention-goers that his country was \"teaching the West how to win a war.\"\n\nWhen Bannon called the Democrats \"demonic,\" a man sitting behind me in the audience exclaimed that they should be \"sent to the gulag.\" Bannon finished his speech by making the crowd promise to \"fight for Trump\" and performing a Nazi salute - a gesture so unmistakable that it prompted a French far-right politician to cancel his CPAC appearance despite Bannon's insistence that it was just a \"wave.\" The horrifying alternated with the surreal as Milei handed Elon Musk a chainsaw on stage, which he waved around alongside a portrait of himself handed to him by an audience member.\n\nThe chainsaw was a perfect symbol of what undergirded this celebration of jingoistic cruelty: the desire for retribution. Trump told the audience that his ongoing purge of the federal government  - with the help of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) - would get rid of \"the fraudsters, liars, cheaters, globalists, and deep-state bureaucrats\" that he believes have wronged him. He spoke these words to a crowd that included a sizable group of pardoned January 6 rioters, including members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.\n\nI encountered a group of so-called \"J6ers\" in the back of the room as Trump was speaking onstage. \"They destroyed my life and my kids' lives,\" exclaimed Rasha Abual-Ragheb, a single mother sentenced to two months of home detention and thirty-six months of probation for her participation in the January 6 riot. \"So fuck you Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, shifty Schiff, DOJ, and FBI. We're gonna get justice by law!\"\n\nAnother woman in the group pointed her finger in the face of a group of reporters, adding, \"The hunters will become the hunted now. Keep that in mind.\"\n\nJulian Feeld hosts and produces the QAA podcast. He has been cited by and appeared on CNN, Wired , PBS, HBO, Vice News, and Arte.

But don't be distracted by the sideshows: the MAGA right takes itself very seriously, and it's hard at work forming a transnational far-right alliance.\n\nConvention-goers at CPAC 2025. (Julian Feeld / Jacobin)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn the surface, this year's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was a garish pageant of jubilance and cruelty. But beneath this flashy exterior lurked something more serious: the outline of a transnational far-right coalition hell-bent on revenge.\n\nWhat I witnessed in Washington, DC, in late February was a Republican Party that, despite largely being in control of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the US government, is still pushing a spite-driven narrative of victimhood and retribution to galvanize its base. Rallying around Donald Trump as a figurehead, the MAGA right is on a mission to purge the federal government and the American political landscape of its perceived enemies. Don't be distracted by the carnival atmosphere: this political bloc takes itself very seriously, and it's hard at work forming alliances with like-minded groups in other countries.\n\nThe halls of the Gaylord National Convention Center were home to a cast of colorful characters in a celebratory mood. An elderly group of five in yellow sequin jackets with giant glittering red letters hanging around their necks that, when properly assembled, spelled TRUMP. A woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty with the words \"TRUMP TRIBE OF TEXAS\" on her dress. A photo booth flanked with red ring lights and a cardboard cutout of the president giving two thumbs up. Three tattooed millennial crypto investors calling themselves \"the Maga Boyz\" decked head to toe in matching stars and stripes.\n\nPeople cheered each other as they crossed paths. They enjoyed drinks and food in the giant atrium. They had won. It was time for a victory lap.\n\nFrequently, the celebratory energy veered into sadism. One man wore a Native American MAGA headdress, a taunt to the woke police. Another donned an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) jacket, lionizing the agency known for raiding workplaces and separating immigrant children from their parents. A photo backdrop labeled DEPORTATION CENTER depicted Trump and his new border czar, Tom Homan, standing in front of prison bars. Caged inside were Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Not pictured but implied were the millions of immigrants Trump has sworn to round up and deport.\n\nBut away from the lively expo floor and crowded halls, before the main events had even started, a more solemn gathering took place: the CPAC International Summit. There, foreign dignitaries and political figures sat around a U-shaped table to discuss the formation of what CPAC director Matt Schlapp called a \"global coalition.\" Present among them were ex-prime minister of the UK Liz Truss, the son of Brazilian ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, the head of a Mexican far-right party Eduardo Verástegui, the chairman of the Japanese Conservative Union Jay Aeba, and representatives of conservative organizations from Hungary, Korea, Australia, Italy, and Israel. Presiding over them was Steve Bannon, founder of the conservative outlet Breitbart , ex-chief strategist to Trump, and host of the War Room podcast.\n\nLong an advocate for a \"global populist movement\" - though the language he used at CPAC shifted to \"populist nationalist movement\" - Bannon has seen much of his vision come to life in Europe, where the far right has been gaining ground with anti-immigrant fervor. He now wants to use Trump's second term as an occasion to bring the movement's lessons home. He doesn't expect it to be easy. \"We're at war,\" he explained, with \"the deep state, the administrative state,\" and \"they don't think they've lost yet.\"\n\nBannon highlighted politicians like Bolsonaro (recently indicted for a coup plot) and South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol (currently being impeached for an attempted coup that saw him invoke martial law), comparing their struggles to those of Trump. Their enemies wanted them jailed and killed, Bannon warned. The solution, in his view, was to change the laws that have been used to prosecute far-right figures for their crimes.\n\nTo that end, he focused his speech on the far right's perceived legislative obstacles. \"They've got the judges. They've got courts,\" he told the gathering. \"They still have immense power. They still have the media.\" This month, Trump instructed the Justice Department to terminate all remaining Biden-era US attorneys and purged top military lawyers - indicating that he and Bannon are on the same page.\n\nThe International Summit highlighted the rise of a far-right transnational coalition, a concept cemented by the speakers on the main stage. They included president of the Spanish Vox party Santiago Abascal, Argentine president Javier Milei, UK politician Nigel Farage, and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni (who joined by video). Their speeches showed cohesion around several topics, one of which was \"Western civilization\" and its supposed pillars: Greek philosophy, Roman law, and Christian values. Common enemies, too, were invoked: \"Islamists,\" \"terrorists,\" \"illegal aliens,\" \"anti-Semites,\" and \"Communists.\" Lines about \"cancel culture\" and \"woke ideology\" almost felt ornamental compared to the venomous joy expressed at the idea of deporting, incarcerating, and killing people who belonged to these enemy categories.\n\nThe crowd at CPAC roared when they were shown an air strike on Somali jihadists, small grainy shapes in satellite images of a mountainside disappearing in a cloud of dust. Cheers erupted at the idea that thousands of criminals (including American citizens) would be deported and indefinitely held in a sprawling Salvadoran megaprison with the help of President Nayib Bukele. Support for the Israeli military intervention in Palestine - considered a genocide by Amnesty International and other human rights organizations - received raucous applause. Israeli politician Amichai Chikli told convention-goers that his country was \"teaching the West how to win a war.\"\n\nWhen Bannon called the Democrats \"demonic,\" a man sitting behind me in the audience exclaimed that they should be \"sent to the gulag.\" Bannon finished his speech by making the crowd promise to \"fight for Trump\" and performing a Nazi salute - a gesture so unmistakable that it prompted a French far-right politician to cancel his CPAC appearance despite Bannon's insistence that it was just a \"wave.\" The horrifying alternated with the surreal as Milei handed Elon Musk a chainsaw on stage, which he waved around alongside a portrait of himself handed to him by an audience member.\n\nThe chainsaw was a perfect symbol of what undergirded this celebration of jingoistic cruelty: the desire for retribution. Trump told the audience that his ongoing purge of the federal government  - with the help of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) - would get rid of \"the fraudsters, liars, cheaters, globalists, and deep-state bureaucrats\" that he believes have wronged him. He spoke these words to a crowd that included a sizable group of pardoned January 6 rioters, including members of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.\n\nI encountered a group of so-called \"J6ers\" in the back of the room as Trump was speaking onstage. \"They destroyed my life and my kids' lives,\" exclaimed Rasha Abual-Ragheb, a single mother sentenced to two months of home detention and thirty-six months of probation for her participation in the January 6 riot. \"So fuck you Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, shifty Schiff, DOJ, and FBI. We're gonna get justice by law!\"\n\nAnother woman in the group pointed her finger in the face of a group of reporters, adding, \"The hunters will become the hunted now. Keep that in mind.\"\n\nJulian Feeld hosts and produces the QAA podcast. He has been cited by and appeared on CNN, Wired , PBS, HBO, Vice News, and Arte.

      "text": "Trump made a mockery of 'Back the Blue' by pardoning Jan. 6 rioters\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's reputation as a master of gaslighting is well deserved. And his contention that he's a staunch defender of law enforcement might be the most maddening of all his falsehoods.\n\nSure, he invented a big lie about a massive conspiracy to steal the 2020 election that's poisoned the brains of tens of millions of Americans and irreversibly damaged the integrity of the United States' body politic. But it's equally risible to profess that \"I am a friend of police, more than any president who's ever been in this office\" shortly after pardoning or commuting the sentences of nearly everyone involved with the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol .\n\nTrump's contention that he's a staunch defender of law enforcement might be the most maddening of all his falsehoods.\n\nThose granted clemency by this self-proclaimed champion of law and order included the ringleaders of the attempted insurrection, rioters carrying ( or wearing ) Nazi and Confederate regalia and chanting their intentions to murder then-Vice President Mike Pence and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , as well as violent criminals who savagely attacked police officers for hours .\n\nThe phrase \" Back the Blue \" has long been used as a cudgel against anyone who dares criticize law enforcement officers and institutions. In this binary, you either unequivocally support cops or you're a woke antifa terrorist.\n\nUntil Trump pardoned the Jan. 6 rioters, \"Back the Blue\" was at its most absurd during the brief period earlier this decade when modest attempts at police reform were attempted (and mostly failed thanks in large part to police union intransigence ). In response, several states passed laws declaring police officers to be a protected identity group.\n\nThis led, predictably, to ridiculously overbroad enforcement - like when a 19-year-old in 2021 was charged with hate crime-enhanced criminal mischief and disorderly conduct for allegedly destroying a \"Blue Lives Matter\" sign and for what the cop described as \"smirking in an intimidating manner.\"\n\nNow that Trump has escaped prosecution for attempting a self-coup, one would think he would have at least limited his blanket pardons to \"nonviolent\" rioters, if only out of respect for the thin blue line. In fact, he had even indicated the pardons would be carefully vetted and rioters who attacked cops might not be granted a presidential pass. But in the end, Trump reportedly just impulsively released them all with a one-page declaration, surprising even his own vice president .\n\nAmong the convicted criminals whom Trump referred to as \"hostages\" unjustly arrested for their actions on a \"day of love\" is Ryan Nichols. NBC News reported on the video evidence implicating Nichols:\n\n\"Ryan Nichols said it, if you voted for f---ing treason we're going to drag your f---ing a-- through the streets,\" he said in the video as he marched to the Capitol.\n\nAfter he was seen on video spraying a giant canister of a chemical weapon at officers inside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel, Nichols bragged about his conduct on Facebook and called for more violence.\n\n\"So if you want to know where Ryan Nichols stands, Ryan Nichols stands for violence,\" he said in a video cited by prosecutors.\n\nPretty unambiguous stuff! And he's hardly an outlier. Also according to NBC News, Daniel Rodriguez \"used a stun gun and plunged it into the neck of Washington Police Officer Michael Fanone multiple times.\" Prosecutors said David Dempsey used \"his hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on.\" Andrew Taake had been sentenced to six years for \"assaulting law enforcement officers with bear spray and a metal whip.\"\n\nI could go on, with hundreds more names of violent Jan. 6 rioters and the crimes they committed, for which they have now been pardoned. One of the more recognizable rioters is Jacob Chansley - also known as the shirtless, horns-wearing \"QAnon Shaman\" - who boasted on X about buying \"SOME MOTHA F***IN GUNS!!!\"\n\nFour officers at the Capitol that day have since died by suicide, which are considered deaths in the line of duty.\n\nSounds ominous! (Trump, a convicted felon, still cannot legally possess firearms , per federal law.) The Fraternal Order of Police , the country's largest police union and enthusiastic endorsers of Trump's campaign, issued a vague and feeble message of disappointment - but not condemnation - of Trump's pardons.\n\nMeanwhile, four officers at the Capitol that day have since died by suicide , which are considered deaths in the line of duty. More officers attacked that day continue to suffer from post-traumatic stress. Now they have to deal with both the indignity of watching their attackers walk free and the fear that the same people Trump incited to attack the Capitol will now take their retribution on the officers or their families.\n\nOne former officer , Aquilino Gonell, posted on X, \"The law and order dude is about to pardon those who assaulted the police. Collectively more than 40 rioters attacked me that day.\" Among the top comments in response are a right-wing podcaster asking, \"How many J6ers did you and your homies pepper spray and shoot rubber bullets at first?\" and a pair of MAGA influencers with millions of followers saying, \"You should be in prison bruh.\"\n\nAnother former officer , Michael Fanone, previously testified that he had been \"grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country\" and earlier this month told CNN's Anderson Cooper, \"My family, my children, and myself are less safe today because of Donald Trump and his supporters.\" And that was before the pardons.\n\nStill another officer , Daniel Hodges, remains on active duty with the Metropolitan Police and worked to protect Trump on his second Inauguration Day. He testified to the House Jan. 6 committee: \"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin-blue-line flag - the symbol of support for law enforcement - more than once being carried by the terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us.\"\n\nTo be sure, Trump's pardon-palooza didn't completely leave out the cops. Some of Trump's pardon giftees were law enforcement officers themselves, and they're now free to rejoin those ranks. Also, Trump pardoned two officers in Washington, D.C., who were convicted of second-degree murder, conspiracy to obstruct, and obstruction of justice. So it's not like he doesn't completely \"Back the Blue.\"\n\nTrump and his supporters often refer to his 1.5 percentage-point victory in the 2024 popular vote as a mandate. Recent polls have shown roughly 60% of Americans oppose pardoning Jan. 6 rioters - a much larger mandate! And though a handful of Republicans in Congress expressed disapproval of the pardons, most either backed pardons for those who attacked the blue , or cravenly stayed silent.\n\nThough Trump's apologists dismiss the violence on Jan. 6 as an episode of brief and unfortunate unrest, I find it difficult to imagine that had the mob reached Mike Pence or Nancy Pelosi, or any member of Congress, they would've merely stopped their rage march and civilly expressed grievances about the 2020 election. These were violent people caught up in a mob hell-bent on finding an outlet for their rage. And if not for the quick thinking of a rank-and-file Capitol cop, that mob likely would have found at least some of their targets. We could be talking today about the violence they committed when they got their hands on Pence and Pelosi, in addition to a few hundred police officers.\n\nToday, these would-be assassins and insurrectionists who nearly killed cops (and in many cases, openly bragged about it on the internet) are free to live their lives, to own guns and to run for elected office. Trump has even indicated he's \"open\" to hosting some of the rioters at the White House , adding, \" What they did is they were protesting a crooked election. People understand that also. And they were treated very badly.\"\n\nThe cops they attacked, meanwhile, are sentenced by Trump to live in fear.\n\nAnthony L. Fisher is a senior editor and writer for MSNBC Daily.

      "text": "On pardons for Jan. 6 rioters, Trump wasn't waiting for a 'green light'\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Steve Benen\n\nIt's not exactly a secret that President Joe Biden sparked a significant controversy when he decided to pardon his son Hunter Biden with many Republicans - and plenty of Democrats - saying the retiring Democrat was wrong to intervene in the case after saying he wouldn't.\n\nBut while much of the pushback is understandable, there's a related dimension to the story that's impossible to take seriously. Politico reported :\n\nAlmost immediately after the Hunter Biden pardon was announced, Trump hinted that he may cite it as justification for granting broad clemency to Jan. 6 defendants. 'Does the pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages?' he asked on social media, describing the [Jan. 6] rioters in terms rooted in his efforts to downplay the violence they wrought against police that day.\n\nThe president-elect wasn't the only one thinking along these lines. John Solomon's online outlet, called Just the News, ran a report with a headline that read, \"Hunter Biden's pardon gives Trump the green light on freeing some Jan. 6 defendants.\" The same report noted a tweet from Charlie Kirk, a prominent far-right media personality and activist, who also wrote online, \"No one in the media better complain when J6ers get their pardons now.\"\n\nSo, a couple of things.\n\nFirst, the idea that Trump has somehow been emboldened by the Hunter Biden pardon, opening the door to the Republican handing \"get out of jail free\" cards to Jan. 6 rioters, is preposterous. The president-elect wasn't waiting for a \"green light\"; he drove through the intersection months ago.\n\nIn 2022 - more than two years ago, before Hunter Biden was even indicted and before Trump had launched his 2024 candidacy - he repeatedly talked up the idea of issuing presidential pardons to those who faced legal consequences for attacking the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn 2024, this talk became more frequent and more explicit. Eleven months ago at a campaign event in New Hampshire, Trump heard from a supporter who urged him to \"free\" Jan. 6 criminals. \"We will,\" he replied .\n\nIn March, he issued a statement vowing in writing that one of his first acts , if returned to the White House, would be to \"free\" those charged and convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6 assault.\n\nLess than a week later, Trump added additional clarity to his plan: Jan. 6 rioters could expect pardons on \" the first day \" of his second term.\n\nWhen Trump sat down with Time magazine's Eric Cortellessa in April, the reporter reminded him that more than 800 Jan. 6 participants have been sentenced through our judicial system, and most of them pleaded guilty. Others were convicted by juries. \"Will you consider pardoning every one of them?\" Cortellessa asked.\n\n\"I would consider that, yes,\" Trump replied .\n\nApparently surprised, the Time reporter added, \"Really?\" to which the Republican said , \"Yes, absolutely.\"\n\nA few months later, during a disastrous appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists, Trump added that he would pardon rioters, even if they assaulted police officers. Though it seemed hard to believe, ABC News anchor Rachel Scott reminded the Republican of the extensive injuries to police officers during the insurrectionist violence, including an officer who lost an eye. She asked whether the rioters who clashed with those officers are \"patriots\" who \"deserve pardons.\"\n\nTrump initially responded by ignoring the question and talking about protesters spray-painting limestone at the Capitol the preceding week. So Scott tried again, asking whether he's prepared to pardon \"rioters who assaulted police officers.\" The GOP nominee replied, \"Oh, absolutely. If they're innocent, I'd pardon them.\"\n\nWhen Scott noted that they were talking about criminals who've already been convicted, Trump added that they were \"convicted by a very, very tough system\" - as if that somehow left open the possibility that the violent rioters, some of whom pleaded guilty, might still be innocent and deserving of presidential pardons.\n\nThis was, as a Politico report noted, \"the most explicit promise Trump has made about the range of defendants he might spring from prison if he takes office - a group that now appears to include some of the most notoriously violent actors that day.\"\n\nThe president-elect wasn't waiting for an excuse or a \"green light.\" The Biden pardon came months - by some measures, years - after Trump had left little doubt about his plan to help those who attacked the country's seat of government in his name.\n\nBut just as importantly, the phrase \"false equivalence\" hangs over the conversation. Some on the right are effectively saying, \"If Biden can pardon his son, then Trump can pardon Jan. 6 rioters.\"\n\nIn reality, however, the former and latter have nothing to do with one another. There's ample reason to believe that Hunter Biden was subjected to selective prosecution because of his relationship to the president. Jan. 6 rioters, on the other hand, engaged in a violent - and ultimately deadly - assault on their own country's Capitol in the hope of helping give illegitimate power to a failed president who'd just been voted out of office.\n\nTo draw a parallel between the two is to strip reality of its meaning.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage .\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Hours after President Trump was sworn into office for the second time, he began issuing a series of presidential pardons for the January 6th insurrection. Listen along as Alex speaks to the inmates, their families, and the police officers who survived one of the most violent attacks on the Capitol in our nation's history.\n\nCatch new episodes of \"Trumpland with Alex Wagner\" on Thursday evenings during Trump's first 100 days. You can find the show in the \"Alex Wagner Tonight\" feed.  Remember to follow the show so you don't miss a single episode. And sign up for MSNBC Premium on Apple Podcasts to listen without ads.\n\nThis episode aired January 23, 2025.\n\nNote: This is a rough transcript. Please excuse any typos.\n\nAlex Wagner: A note to listeners, this podcast contains some explicit language.\n\nRachel Maddow: Trump is now officially 47th President of the United States. That happened at noon on the dot. He then took the oath of office very shortly thereafter. His second inaugural address.\n\nDonald Trump: During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.\n\nAlex Wagner: Earlier this week, on a very cold afternoon in Washington, D.C., Donald John Trump was sworn in as the 47th President of the United States. Trump was inside the Capitol Rotunda surrounded by the political, financial and cultural elite. But outside of that room, the ceremony was watched by millions of people the world over.\n\nSome were anxious, others were excited. Everyone was wondering about what a second Trump term will mean for immigration, the economy, the environment, America, and the globe.\n\nI'm Alex Wagner, host of \"Alex Wagner Tonight\" on MSNBC. And for the first 100 days of this new administration, I'm going to be taking a break from the anchor chair to get out into the field. I'll be going to the front lines and speaking to the players and the principals on both the issuing and receiving ends of Trump's policies. We're calling this new show, \"Trumpland with Alex Wagner.\"\n\nThese are conversations we can't always have on TV, with people you definitely don't usually see on TV. You'll get a 360-degree view of what's happening both at home and overseas now that Donald Trump is once again President of the United States.\n\nThis week, I've been reporting on a group of people nervously anticipating what President Trump might do on his very first week back in the White House.\n\nLester Holt: President Donald Trump not wasting any time getting down to business.\n\nAlex Wagner: The convicted defendants of the January 6 insurrection, as well as their families and the police officers who were the victims of the attack itself.\n\nDonald Trump: We want a unified country. They said, \"Don't talk about the J6 hostages that you're going to be releasing today.\n\nAlex Wagner: Do you think now that he's pardoned everybody, he can count on this group of people again?\n\nBen Pollock: Oh, absolutely. I would die for the man. I would have died for him that day.\n\nMichael Fanone: There are no words to describe this moment other than I've been betrayed by my country.\n\nAlex Wagner: Within hours of taking office, President Trump issued full pardons to roughly 1,500 J6 defendants.\n\nSo, on this first episode of \"Trumpland with Alex Wagner,\" I'm headed to D.C., but not for the inauguration. We're headed to jail.\n\nUnidentified Male: Thank you, President, for signing those pardons. And as always, as I've told everybody, remember the President adheres to his promises. Promises made, promises kept. Promises made, promises kept. Promises made, promises kept.\n\nAlex Wagner: On the campaign trail, Donald Trump talked repeatedly about pursuing pardons for January 6 inmates if he was elected. You could read a lot into the fact that he referred to them as hostages.\n\nBut this outcome, the blanket pardon of 1,500 criminal defendants involved in the Capitol insurrection, is just about the most extreme version of what this might have looked like. Nobody really saw this coming, even Trump's running mate.\n\nJust eight days before being sworn in as vice president, JD Vance indicated quite strongly that violent offenders would not be granted pardons.\n\nJD Vance: If you protested peacefully on January the 6th and you've had Merrick Garland's Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned.\n\nAlex Wagner: But of course, that is exactly what Donald Trump did, literally hours after he was sworn in as president. And there was no better audience for that news on Monday night than the one outside the detention facility in Washington where an estimated 22 January sixers have been locked up, D.C. jail.\n\nUnidentified Male: Praise God. Thank you so much, Lord Jesus, for doing the good work that we know that you do. Holy Spirit, you're welcome here outside the D.C. gulag. We will be receiving our J6 hostages by midnight. This is going to happen.\n\nAlex Wagner: The jail is a multi-story concrete building. From where we're standing across the street, you can see an intake area, with large gates that open for vehicles and barbed wire spooled around the tops of the building. People are gathered in a small open patch of dead grass. It's sloped downhill and there's ice everywhere. But for the crowd of 50-ish die-hard January 6 supporters, this might as well be a summer barbecue. There's music and singing and dancing. All that's missing are the hot dogs.\n\nUnidentified Male: Put your hands up, J6. Put your hands up, everybody. Let's go, let's celebrate for our freedom.\n\nAlex Wagner: A small group of family and friends has been meeting outside this facility to hold a vigil and sing the national anthem while on the phone with the inmates inside.\n\n(CROWD SINGING NATIONAL ANTHEM)\n\nAlex Wagner: They've been doing this every night for over 900 days, and they're getting impatient.\n\nUnidentified Male: Hey, hey, D.C. gulag, let our people go!\n\nUnidentified Male: Let our people go..\n\nAlex Wagner: What have you heard about what the President is doing tonight?\n\nMickey Witthoff: I heard everybody's getting out of jail. Tonight, we've had several released across the country.\n\nAlex Wagner: But no one's come out of D.C. jail.\n\nMickey Witthoff: Not yet.\n\nAlex Wagner: I wasn't here, but what was the reaction like when you heard the news?\n\nMickey Witthoff: It's amazing. It's what everybody's been waiting for, for four years.\n\nAlex Wagner: One of the main organizers of these vigils is Mickey Witthoff. They call her Mama Mickey and she's become a second mother for countless January 6 defendants and their families. Mama Mickey is a no-bullshit kind of presence at these vigils, someone who both advocates loudly for the inmates inside the jail and keeps their supporters outside of it in line. She's also the mother of Ashli Babbitt, the only January 6 protester who was shot and killed by Capitol Police.\n\nYou may have seen the video, a woman trying to climb through one of the doors where glass had been broken out. As the mob breaches an area of the Capitol until she's taken down by a shot from a Capitol Police officer, a shot that proved to be fatal.\n\nBabbitt was a 35-year-old Air Force veteran who had traveled to D.C. from California to be there that day. J6ers consider Babbitt a martyr for their cause and Mama Mickey a representative for family members of those prosecuted. She says she's spoken to Donald Trump multiple times.\n\nSo, was anybody surprised or did everybody thought he was going to let everyone out?\n\nMickey Witthoff: He said he was and then when I talked to him last week, he said, tell them that he loves them, keep their chins up and he's been supportive throughout. He's called the vigil and talked to them over the phone and I am not surprised. And I think anybody that was there that day, even the men that weren't perfectly well-behaved have done enough time and it's time for them to come home.\n\nAlex Wagner: You'll have to forgive the music in the background, but as I mentioned, this gathering was part vigil, part protest, part celebration.\n\nDo you think President Trump's going to suffer any political fallout from pardoning people?\n\nMickey Witthoff: He suffers political fallout for whatever he does.\n\nAlex Wagner: But I just mean there are some folks who are in jail who assaulted law officers (inaudible).\n\nMickey Witthoff: Well, there were lots of law officers that assaulted American citizens. They said that everybody came to overthrow the government and if you think about the fact that it was a gun-toting populist of the United States of America that showed up on the Capitol grounds, and the only weapon used was the one that was used to kill my daughter. So, American citizens did not show up to take over the government with water bottles and flag poles.\n\nAlex Wagner: I just wonder if you think the whole country's going to see it that way.\n\nMickey Witthoff: No.\n\nAlex Wagner: So you think he's taking a risk?\n\nMickey Witthoff: Absolutely.\n\nAlex Wagner: I'm sure you feel like you're going to have his back for this. What does that look like?\n\nMickey Witthoff: Trump supporters will always be Trump supporters. Haters might always be Trump haters, unless they give him a chance to be America's president, which I believe he will be a president for all Americans. I believe right now, you know, with the system we have, with the Democrats and Republicans, and I think that our leaders, they divide us by example.\n\nAlex Wagner: As we moved around the crowd, there was an older gentleman giving a speech while holding a huge American flag, one that he says he carried with him on January 6th. It's gigantic, bigger than the bedspread on a California king. It's also flying upside down.\n\nMickey Witthoff: 1,475 days.\n\nUnidentified Male: You heard it first from Mama Mickey. God bless you. God bless the U.S.A! Feudal day, baby.\n\nAlex Wagner: His name is Ben Pollock, and he's here from Florida.\n\nI'm with MSNBC.\n\nBen Pollock: Oh, hi.\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah. So, we're out here, we're trying to understand what's happening.\n\nBen Pollock: Wow.\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah.\n\nBen Pollock: It's about time I got to talk to you guys. I've been waiting --\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah, I'm sure.\n\nBen Pollock: -- quite a while for an interview.\n\nAlex Wagner: Well, here we are.\n\nBen Pollock: Yeah. Here we are, the last day.\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah. Well, we're at the beginning of a whole new chapter.\n\nBen Pollock: Yeah, right. That's right.\n\nAlex Wagner: So, you've been out here holding vigil. Who do you have inside?\n\nBen Pollock: I got Jonathan Pollock and Olivia Pollock. We were all, as a family, came up on January 6th with our church. And I got friends, Michael Perkins, and he's going to be released out of Coleman in Florida. And then I got another buddy on an ankle monitor. All my friends are locked up right now.\n\nAlex Wagner: It's your son and daughter?\n\nBen Pollock: Yes.\n\nAlex Wagner: What are they in for?\n\nBen Pollock: They're in for about everything.\n\nAlex Wagner: We looked up the exact charges and just about everything isn't a bad description. Jonathan faced 17 counts and multiple alleged felonies, including assaulting officers with a dangerous weapon. In Jonathan's case, that meant charging at police with a flagpole. Among Jonathan's other charges were violent entry, disorderly conduct and theft of government property.\n\nOlivia was charged with multiple felony offenses along similar lines as her brother. She also assaulted police officers who were trying to contain the riot outside the Capitol.\n\nBefore the two were arrested last year, they were on the lam, running from law enforcement and evading accountability for three years. Now their trial, which was supposed to take place next month, has been scrapped. Their charges dropped and their release from the D.C. jail imminent.\n\nDo you think now that he's pardoned everybody, he can count on this group of people again?\n\nBen Pollock: Oh, absolutely. I would die for the man. I would have died for him that day.\n\nAlex Wagner: I would die for the man. Here's this father out here in almost zero-degree weather, flying a 10-foot-long American flag, waiting for his children to be released from jail. And his commitment to the guy who landed him in this nightmare is unwavering. So, yeah, I believe Ben Pollock.\n\nThe police had been maintaining a loose perimeter in front of the jail, insisting everyone stay across the street in the designated vigil area. But at one point, there's some type of commotion coming from inside the jail, just beyond the glass doors that block our entry.\n\nI think someone's getting out. Should we go across the street? Yeah. All right, so, okay.\n\nPeople start to run towards the front entrance of the jail. In a matter of seconds, there's a large crowd.\n\nDozens of police stream out of the building and from down the street to form a barricade in front of the glass. The loose perimeter they had been maintaining is no longer so loose. The energy in the air is frenzied.\n\nWatch out, Leon. Watch out. It's like you're on a mound of ice.\n\nBut whatever anyone initially thought, it does not appear anyone is being released. Police start to push us back to the park, slowly, and thankfully without issue.\n\nUnidentified Female: Here all the time, don't move.\n\nUnidentified Male: May I have your attention, please. You guys can protest and say whatever you'd like from the comfort of the sidewalk and the park. Please do not try and come across the street. Thank you.\n\nAlex Wagner: It ended up just being a brief interaction, but it was tense and it was hard to avoid how on the nose it all felt. January 6 participants and their family members rushing towards a line of officers, a reminder of how quickly a crowd can become a mob.\n\nAnd then around 10 PM, a couple of well-dressed guys, perhaps just arriving after an inaugural ball, come out to announce that two prisoners, brothers Andrew and Matthew Valentin, have been released, unceremoniously, through a back exit. And it appears that's probably it for tonight.\n\nBy 11 PM, police officers start leaving, and so do we.\n\nUnidentified Male: Free J6.\n\nAlex Wagner: We're back the next day, January 21st, bright and early-ish, and so is the crowd. Very, very slowly, inmates from the D.C. jail are being released.\n\nDid you get out today?\n\nRachel Powell: Yes, just a little bit ago.\n\nAlex Wagner: And you weren't here, right?\n\nRachel Powell: Yes.\n\nAlex Wagner: You were here?\n\nRachel Powell: I was here for the last couple of weeks because I was waiting to be resentenced.\n\nAlex Wagner: This is Rachel Powell, better known as \"Bullhorn Lady\" or \"Pink Hat Lady,\" along with her friend, Cynthia Hughes. According to prosecutors, on January 6th, Powell was part of a group of rioters who used a cardboard pipe as a battering ram to break a window at the Capitol. She also used an ice axe for a different window.\n\nPowell wore a recognizable pink hat and used a bullhorn to give rioters instructions, telling them that they needed to coordinate together if they were going to take the building. Powell had only been at the D.C. jail for a few weeks after being moved from Hazelton federal prison in West Virginia. She was found guilty of a total of nine felony and misdemeanor offenses and served only one year of her five-year sentence.\n\nThe thing I wonder is, was there ever any moment in jail where you were, like, why am I here? Did you ever have any frustration with President Trump? Did you ever feel like he had landed you guys in jail?\n\nRachel Powell: No, no, absolutely not because I believe he really just wants to make America great again. Now, why was I sitting in prison when Anthony Fauci is loose? Why am I sitting in prison when Liz Cheney is loose? Why do those people get pardons? Because they're guilty, but they were never brought to justice. And yet me, a mom, I made a mistake and broke a window at the Capitol. I'm sorry, but do I have to lose my whole life for it when we have these criminals running the government that now have pardons? That bothered me.\n\nCynthia Hughes: Donald Trump is not responsible for January 6th, okay? Grown men and grown women, whatever actions they took that day, they are responsible for themselves. And the country spoke loud and proud on November 5th, and they said, \"Donald Trump is not responsible for January 6th,\" and that's what we believe.\n\nAlex Wagner: We met another recent exoneree, a younger man, 31 years old, named Robert Morss. Morss has curly, long hair, which was being kept in place under a bright red Make America Great Again hat. Morss was one of several people who had been released from a different detention center, but came to Washington to show his support.\n\nSo my name's Alex.\n\nRobert Morss: Nice to meet you.\n\nAlex Wagner: Nice to meet you.\n\nWhen did you get out?\n\nRobert Morss: Last night, 11:45 PM.\n\nAlex Wagner: And where were you?\n\nRobert Morss: I was in the Pittsburgh halfway house.\n\nAlex Wagner: Okay.\n\nRobert Morss: Yeah.\n\nAlex Wagner: So, you were in a halfway house.\n\nRobert Morss: Yes.\n\nAlex Wagner: Can you explain how you ended up being there?\n\nRobert Morss: Sure. So, on June 11th, 2021, I was arrested for my actions on January 6th.\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah.\n\nRobert Morss: I spent the next three and a half years in prison. And then on August 29th of last year, I was released from prison to the halfway house in Pittsburgh.\n\nAlex Wagner: Okay.\n\nRobert Morss: And that's where I remained until last night. And instead of going home and going to sleep, like I really wish I did right now, I decided to drive here.\n\nAlex Wagner: In May of 2023, Morss was sentenced to 66 months for several charges, including assaulting, resisting or impeding officers with a dangerous weapon. Before January 6, Morss had served as an Army Ranger and did three tours in Afghanistan. He told me, he now feels like a new man.\n\nRobert Morss: I've grown accustomed to being a felon. I've grown accustomed to having weight on my back and essentially trying to get used to the fact that my former life was just eradicated. Half of my friends and family don't speak to me anymore. My brothers completely disowned me. My dad who raised me to fall in love with the Founding Fathers, read the Declaration of Independence on the 4th of July, barely even speaks to me, so this has not been easy.\n\nWhen the Declaration of Independence ends with the last lines of them pledging their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to each other, we kind of know what that's like to have it all taken from us. So, it was a beautiful thing and almost like God's poetry to have it slowly returned with a slate being wiped clean and being free at last.\n\nAlex Wagner: Let me ask you something. You've been through this whole thing.\n\nRobert Morss: Yes.\n\nAlex Wagner: If Trump comes out and says, this is an issue that I need you guys to come out for me. I need you guys to show up for me. It may mean taking to the streets. Do you think that the people who just served years or months or weeks in prison would do that again for him?\n\nRobert Morss: I can't speak for everybody, but I can speak for myself, and the answer to that question would be yes. I think that Donald Trump is the only politician that we've seen in a long time that is not only willing to keep his word, but also who's not willing to back down when he's up against the wall.\n\nI mean, this man's been indicted. He's been attacked. He's been shot at.\n\nAlex Wagner: He's been attempted assassination.\n\nRobert Morss: He's been through hell. I mean, name anybody else that would have been willing to go through that stuff. And he's admitted that he's lost billions of dollars by being president. And so, I mean, whether you like him or you hate him, you got to respect that this man is not a quitter. And so if this man really needed us to show up somewhere, I can't speak for anybody else, but since he's not going to quit on the American people, I have no absolute right to quit on him, so I would show up.\n\nAlex Wagner: We're going to take a quick break. But when we come back, we'll speak with someone who has risked everything to set the record straight on January 6th, and we'll find out what Trump's pardons have meant for him.\n\n(ADVERTISEMENT)\n\nAlex Wagner: Welcome back to \"Trumpland.\"\n\nWhen you talk to friends and family members and the actual January 6 inmates themselves, there is a profound sense of victimhood, of grievance, a deep belief that they were wronged by the federal government and the Department of Justice. Very rarely do any of these folks acknowledge the violence of that day. And if they do, they often blame it on a conspiracy theory that January 6 was an inside job, as if to absolve themselves.\n\nThere is no proof of that, of course. And the record also plainly shows that January 6 was not a victimless crime. Ashli Babbitt was not the only person who died as a result of January 6. Police Officer Brian Sicknick died in the hospital after he was attacked at the Capitol. Countless law enforcement officers experienced lingering injuries and profound trauma. Police officers Howie Liebengood, Gunther Hashida, Kyle DeFreytag and Jeffrey Smith all later died by suicide.\n\nDuring this trip, we were in touch with several current and former members of the Capitol Police who witnessed and were attacked at the Capitol on January 6. One of those men was Michael Fanone.\n\nYou might remember him. Fanone was an officer for the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department who was tased in the neck by a rioter. Right after he was attacked, Fanone suffered a heart attack and lost consciousness. Another rioter then dragged him into the crowd where a pro-Trump mob began beating him to the brink of death. A few months later, Fanone testified to the January 6 Committee about what had happened.\n\nMichael Fanone: At one point, I came face-to-face with an attacker who repeatedly lunged for me and attempted to remove my firearm. I heard chanting from some in the crowd, \"Get his gun and kill him with his own gun.\"\n\nAlex Wagner: He said that the rioters called him a traitor and that they only stopped their violent attack after Fanone pleaded that he has children. Fanone resigned from the force 11 months after January 6, reportedly ending his 20-year career in law enforcement with a resignation letter written on a napkin that read, \"Go fuck yourselves.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, my colleague Peter Alexander asked President Trump about his decision to pardon DJ Rodriguez, the man who tased Fanone during the January 6th insurrection. President Trump didn't have a clear answer.\n\nPeter Alexander: You would agree that it's never acceptable to assault a police officer, right?\n\nDonald Trump: Sure.\n\nPeter Alexander: So, then if I can, among those you pardoned DJ Rodriguez. He drove a stun gun into the neck of a D.C. police officer who was abducted by the mob that day. He later confessed on video to the FBI and pleaded guilty for his crimes. Why does he deserve a pardon?\n\nDonald Trump: Well, I don't know. Was it a pardon? Because we're looking at commutes and we're looking at pardons?\n\nPeter Alexander: Yes, it's a pardon.\n\nDonald Trump: Okay. Well, we'll take a look at everything, but I can say this, murderers today are not even charged.\n\nAlex Wagner: We'd had an interview planned with Fanone the day after the mass pardons, but in the morning, we got word that he was heading to the Prince William County Courthouse in Virginia to seek a protective order against several of the people who had just been pardoned by President Trump for their involvement in the Capitol attack.\n\nWe were still able to reach him, but by phone. Me inside our car outside of the D.C. detention center, and Michael Fanone heading to the courthouse.\n\nI'm ready. Are you there, Michael? Mr. Fanone?\n\nMichael Fanone: I'm here.\n\nAlex Wagner: Hey, thank you for doing this.\n\nMichael Fanone: Of course.\n\nAlex Wagner: So I'm outside of D.C. jail. I was here last night and I've been, you know, trying to get a sense of how people are processing the moment. And I think it probably doesn't surprise you that the families of the inmates are very excited. They feel like Trump has really delivered for them. And I've been wondering how this is all going over with you. What's your reaction to the pardons and the news of the day?\n\nMichael Fanone: I mean, there are no words to describe this moment other than I've been betrayed by my country.\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah.\n\nMichael Fanone: I've been betrayed by those that supported the former president, now President of the United States. I've been betrayed by his political opponents, the Democratic Party. I've been betrayed by law enforcement.\n\nAlex Wagner: Were you surprised that he pardoned basically almost all of them and commuted the sentences of the rest?\n\nMichael Fanone: Donald Trump announced his candidacy in Waco, Texas. The scene of one of the bloodiest conflicts between the American fringe extremist movement and law enforcement. That's where he chose to announce that he was running for president. And he's been saying he was going to pardon each and every one of these violent criminals since day one.\n\nAlex Wagner: This morning, you were going to seek a protective order. Can you talk a little bit about that?\n\nMichael Fanone: I mean, listen, once those charges were dismissed and they received pardons, essentially, in addition to being released from prison, there's no longer any order in place preventing these individuals from contacting myself and my family. These are individuals who violently assaulted me.\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah.\n\nMichael Fanone: I was the victim in these criminal cases and in Trump's Department of Justice, these people go free, and I have no recourse to protect myself and my family.\n\nSo, I'm seeking a protective order. I don't know if it's going to be granted to be totally honest with you.\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah. It occurs to me that this is also sending a separate message to people who would otherwise operate extra judicially outside the bounds of the law to do Trump's bidding, right? He basically now has, well, at least, like, 1,100, 1,200, 1,300 people who have proven that they are willing to do whatever they need to, to keep Trump in power, and now he's just freed all of them.\n\nMichael Fanone: It says this. It says, this is the age of lawlessness. If you are a Trump supporter and you commit violent crimes on Trump's behalf, Donald Trump will free you.\n\nAlex Wagner: I wonder what you make of Trump is, as you point out, he's president. He owns the Department of Justice. What about the other Republicans in office? I mean, does it concern you that the leadership in Congress seems kind of intent on forgetting what actually happened on January 6?\n\nMichael Fanone: I don't think they're intent on forgetting what happened on January 6. I think they're intent on changing the story of January 6 to a patriotic event in which thousands of American patriots fought back against the deep state. That's going to be the new narrative. You know, I will be the villain in this story.\n\nAlex Wagner: So, rewriting history in real time.\n\nMichael Fanone: Correct.\n\nAlex Wagner: You're one of only a handful of law enforcement officers who've spoken out about this. Do you feel like other folks are watching this and have watched this all play out and are just trying to keep their heads down because they're worried about their own safety?\n\nMichael Fanone: I will never forgive the officers of the Metropolitan Police Department, U.S. Capitol Police who failed to bear witness to what they experienced on January 6th. I believe wholeheartedly that had there been hundreds of officers lined up to testify about their experience instead of four, that we may not be in this position that we are today.\n\nThat being said, it doesn't just stop at the law enforcement officers. It stops at every American. It stops at anyone who has been adversely affected by Donald Trump and his surrogates and supporters. And anyone who has seen their neighbor adversely affected by Donald Trump and his surrogates and who refuse to step up, speak out, I would hope that journalists seize this moment and refuse to allow anyone in Congress or any elected official to escape taking a side on these pardons.\n\nAlex Wagner: Can you tell me what else you're doing today? So, you've already gone to file the protective order, is that right? Or are you on your way to do that?\n\nMichael Fanone: I'm on my way to the courthouse now to file a protective order. After that, I am going to go with my ex-wife and help her with her first firearm.\n\nAlex Wagner: Oh, wow.\n\nMichael Fanone: This is very real for us. I don't know if you followed some of the incidents involving my mother, but you know, she's been swatted. She's received threats. I've been confronted in public places and threatened. And she recently had someone throw a bag of feces on her --\n\nAlex Wagner: Wow.\n\nMichael Fanone: -- while she was out raking the leaves in her front yard. This is very real. And unfortunately, law enforcement has been feckless in its ability or attempts to protect me and my family.\n\nAlex Wagner: I don't get it. I'm on the outside. I've never been in law enforcement, but how can cops --\n\nMichael Fanone: I already know your question, Alex, and I'm going to answer it for you. The idea that police officers in this country, law enforcement officers, are stewards of the Constitution is bullshit. I was not a steward of the Constitution. I didn't subvert it, but I looked at it as an impediment in doing my job. My job was to put bad guys in bad places.\n\nAnd so the American law enforcement officer responds in a positive way when Donald Trump says things, like, we're going to suspend the Constitution, and we're going to let you loose in these communities. We're going to get rid of crime in a day.\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah.\n\nMichael Fanone: We're going to let you go out there and do your job, which is just a dog whistle for beat the shit out of everybody that doesn't comply. And that's why you can't rely on police officers and police departments to protect you in this age of government lawlessness.\n\nAlex Wagner: It's staggering to me that the people who assaulted law enforcement are being pardoned and standing law enforcement is okay with that. I don't get it. I mean, I understand what you're saying, but it's still just an alignment between law enforcement and Trump that seems real unbreakable if they can get with this.\n\nMichael Fanone: I mean, listen, my friend at The Washington Post asked Chief Pamela Smith at the Metropolitan Police Department to comment on this. And you know what her response was? \"No comment.\" The chief of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. --\n\nAlex Wagner: Yeah.\n\nMichael Fanone: -- whose officers were violently assaulted by these individuals has no comment and it's all fear. It's the fear of Donald Trump taking office and what retribution lies in store for me if I simply speak the truth and say that this is an outrage.\n\nWell, this is the example of evil exists and persists when good men do nothing. America is doing nothing.\n\nAlex Wagner: We reached out to Michael Fanone the day after that phone call. He told us that the process to seek protective orders was a lot more difficult than anything he had expected. And to carry them out, he would have to find the location for each individual he was concerned about and serve them papers in person. And even then, the protective order would only last two weeks. He told our producers, quote, \"That America simply doesn't give a shit about justice.\"\n\nJanuary 6 was a profoundly devastating moment for American democracy. The peaceful transfer of power, once a sacrosanct part of our unique system of self-governance, was trampled. And what's clear this week is that the fracture that began that day, the tear in the fabric of our democracy, is nowhere close to being repaired.\n\nWith Trump's elevation as the 47th President, the opportunity to degrade not just systems and institutions, but the truth itself, those opportunities will continue to present themselves in ways we can't yet imagine.\n\nThanks for listening.

      "text": "Trump Pardons Jan. 6 Rioters and Signs Order on TikTok\n\nTrump Administration\n\nThe president ordered the withdrawal of the country from the Paris climate agreement and took action on immigration policy and other issues such as creating the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\ntranscript\n\n\"So I am revoking nearly 80 destructive, radical executive actions of the previous administration, they'll all be null and void within about what, five minutes. Is that them over there? Five minutes.\" \"The first item that President Trump is signing is the rescission of 78 Biden era executive actions, executive orders, presidential memoranda and others.\" [cheering] \"Thank you, sir.\" [cheering] \"The next item here is the withdrawal from the Paris climate treaty.\" [cheering]\n\nNoah Weiland and Maggie Haberman\n\nPresident Trump on Monday pardoned members of the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and signed dozens of executive orders addressing the first priorities of his administration.\n\nMr. Trump gave sweeping pardons to nearly all of the 1,600 rioters charged with storming the Capitol and commuted the sentences of several others. His decision appears to cover both people accused of low-level, nonviolent offenses that day and those who committed violence.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump's first executive orders froze most federal hiring, halted new federal rule-making and revoked roughly 80 executive orders issued by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\nWithdrawing from pacts: Among the orders Mr. Trump signed were a pair ordering the country to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and from the World Health Organization .\n\nTikTok ban: Mr. Trump said he had signed an executive order to stall a federal ban of the app. The order told the attorney general not to enforce the law for 75 days to give the Trump administration \"an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward.\" Read more ›\n\nAdministrative actions: Some of the first administrative actions of the Trump administration took place around the time of Mr. Trump's inaugural speech. Federal officials shut down a government app that allows migrants to schedule appointments to use ports of entry, an option that almost a million immigrants used while it was active.\n\nReturn to the office: Mr. Trump also ordered federal workers to return full time to in-person work. His hiring freeze also specifically targeted the Internal Revenue Service .\n\nBirthright citizenship: Mr. Trump signed an executive order defining birthright citizenship. The president cannot change the Constitution on his own, but he has made it clear he wants to deny birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, to the children of noncitizens. It is all but certain to be challenged in court.\n\nBiden pardons: Mr. Trump expressed displeasure about a last-minute wave of pre-emptive pardons issued by President Biden to protect some of Mr. Trump's adversaries, including Gen. Mark A. Milley. Two of those pardoned, Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, and former Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, thanked Mr. Biden, saying they had been pardoned \"not for breaking the law but for upholding it.\"\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nThe crowd cheered and the music blared.\n\nOn Monday night outside the D.C. jail, some of the family members, fervent supporters and former detainees gathered there swiveled their hips and pumped their fists to a remix of \"Y.M.C.A.,\" in a scene reminiscent of a Trump rally.\n\nThey were there to celebrate President Trump's broad grant of clemency to nearly all 1,600 Jan. 6 defendants, though only a dozen of those pardoned remained in this particular jail on the morning of his inauguration. The nightly vigil, which has lasted for close to two and a half years, has served as the emotional epicenter of support for those who have been prosecuted in connection with the violent attack on the Capitol four years ago.\n\nMicki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt , an Air Force veteran who was fatally shot by the police as rioters tried to storm the building on Jan. 6, 2021, typically kicked off the gathering with a roll call of all the detainees across the country. But not on Monday.\n\n\"We're going to skip that tonight because it's just a variable,\" Ms. Witthoeft said. \"Everybody's getting out.\"\n\nOnly two men, Andrew and Matthew Valentin, brothers who were sentenced just days ago, walked free on Monday, according to Paul Ingrassia, the newly appointed White House liaison to the Justice Department.\n\nBrandon Fellows , 30, who served time at the D.C. jail after being convicted of, among other charges, obstructing the certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s electoral victory, addressed the crowd. Mr. Fellows, who was photographed smoking marijuana in the office of Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, stressed that those who would be leaving prison had a long road ahead.\n\n\"Please keep in mind, the people that are coming out, it's going to be a little rough - it's going to be tough,\" Mr. Fellows said.\n\nMary Pollock, 24, had accompanied her father from Florida in hopes of reuniting with her siblings, Olivia and Jonathan Pollock , who were being held at the jail after they broke the terms of their release two years ago by going on the run.\n\n\"They've kept their spirits up in there,\" she said. \"They've been encouraging the other J6 prisoners.\"\n\nThe scene outside the jail was a departure from the usual vigil held in the back of the facility, under windows that the detainees can peer out of. Men and women who were imprisoned and their families called supporters throughout the night, updating them on the status of their release - but also to proclaim their innocence, as they ordinarily do.\n\nThe crowd had been buoyed by Mr. Trump's promise to issue sweeping pardons on Day 1 of his presidency. They were already anticipating the fulfillment of another vow of his, to pursue his rivals by prosecuting them. Mr. Trump told NBC News in December that the entire Jan. 6 committee \"should go to jail.\"\n\n\"They need to sit in that jail - not the innocent people,\" said Tia Myers, 53, from Fort Thomas, Kentucky, who said she was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and was investigated by the F.B.I. although she did not go inside the building.\n\nMany at the rally sought to rewrite the violent history of the Jan. 6 attack, a narrative that Mr. Trump himself has endorsed at rallies, in news conferences and on television.\n\n\"We saw the cops waving everybody in,\" Ms. Myers said of herself and others who had come to the Capitol that day out of a false conviction that Mr. Trump had won the 2020 election. She quickly added, \"We didn't go in, obviously.\"\n\nScott Tapley, from Goshen, Ind., who brought his two adult daughters to Washington for the inauguration, as he did four years ago to watch Mr. Trump address his supporters on Ellipse on Jan. 6, said the people who had gone inside did so to protest \"peacefully and patriotically,\" only to be treated unfairly by the justice system.\n\n\"I'm so glad to see they're being released,\" Mr. Tapley said. \"This is just an unspeakably joyous, happy day.\"\n\nEven before Mr. Trump formally issued his pardons, Peyton, 20, and Sarah Reffitt, 28, were more reserved in expressing their joy. As the daughters of Guy Reffitt, a member of the Texas Three Percenters militia who was the first person to be charged with a crime for Jan. 6, they had seen their lives upended by the events of that day.\n\nPeyton, tears in her eyes, said she wished her father, who was currently detained in Oklahoma, was home so she could annoy him. But her family had a lot of healing to do, she added - her brother, Jackson, had turned her father in to the authorities and their home was raided 10 days after the attack on the Capitol.\n\nShe said she believed that her father should be held accountable, but she worried that his time in jail and her mother's desire to free him were \"toxic.\"\n\n\"Everything else was taken and this is what they were left with.\" She added, \"They can't just walk away - it's sad.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nIn the first late-night social media post of his second term, President Trump said that his administration was in the process of removing \"over a thousand\" Biden administration appointees who had not already resigned.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nTrump named four such appointees in the post, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who had served on the President's National Infrastructure Advisory Council.\n\n\"YOU'RE FIRED!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nNo one else would be released from the D.C. jail today, Sergeant Michael Bowman from Washington's Metropolitan Police Department told the crowd outside in an attempt to get people to go home. Two Jan. 6 detainees were released from the facility earlier, according to a Trump administration official.\n\nHamed Aleaziz\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump moved on Monday to toss out a Biden-era program that allowed migrants fleeing four troubled nations to fly into the United States and remain in the country temporarily, part of a sweeping first-day crackdown on immigration.\n\nThe program, known as humanitarian parole and introduced by the Biden administration in early 2023, allowed migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela to fly into the United States if they had a financial sponsor and passed security checks. Migrants who entered under the program could stay for up to two years, unless they found other ways to stay long term.\n\nAs of late last year, more than 500,000 migrants had entered the country through the initiative.\n\nTrump wants to end several programs that offered new arrivals temporary relief. Millions of others without legal status may also be vulnerable to deportation.\n\nThe program, which Mr. Trump ordered the head of the Department of Homeland Security to end, served as one of two major legal pathways the Biden administration put in place to try to discourage migrants from crossing into the country illegally. The Trump administration already moved earlier Monday to shut down the other program - a government app that allowed migrants to schedule appointments to enter the country at legal ports of entry.\n\n\"These processes - a safe and orderly way to reach the United States - have resulted in a significant reduction in the number of these individuals encountered at our southern border,\" Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the Biden administration's homeland security secretary, said last spring. \"It is a key element of our efforts to address the unprecedented level of migration throughout our hemisphere.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers viewed the program as a way for migrants with no other access to the United States a chance to enter the country for up to two years and obtain work permits.\n\n\"Here's an idea: Don't fly millions of illegals aliens from failed states thousands of miles away into small towns across the American Heartland,\" Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump's immigration policy, said on social media in September.\n\nTexas, along with other Republican-led states, sued to end the program and failed. But the Biden administration had already said in October that it would allow the permission for migrants from the four countries to lapse after their two years ran out, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to find other methods to stay in the country or face deportation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlan Feuer\n\nJust hours after Trump's sweeping Jan. 6 pardons were issued, his new U.S. attorney in Washington, Ed Martin, started dismissing some cases stemming from the Capitol attack, court papers show. Martin has long been an advocate for Jan. 6 defendants and has ties to the Patriot Freedom Project, one of the largest legal fundraising groups for the rioters.\n\nAlan Feuer\n\nOne of the cases that Martin has moved to dismiss is the trial of Jared Wise, a former F.B.I. agent charged with felony civil disorder and assault. Prosecutors say that Wise confronted officers at the Capitol, calling them Nazis and encouraging a mob of Trump supporters to kill them.\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nPaul Ingrassia, the newly appointed White House liaison to the Justice Department, just arrived outside the D.C. jail and spoke to the crowd that had gathered in anticipation that Jan. 6 detainees could be released. Wearing a tuxedo and red scarf, he said that two men from the D.C. facility had already been released: brothers Andrew and Matthew Valentin. According to news reports, they were sentenced just days earlier.\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border on Monday, invoking special presidential powers that allow him to unilaterally unlock federal funding for border wall construction and potentially to deploy the military and National Guard to the border.\n\nMr. Trump took a similar step during his first term as a way to circumvent Congress and access billions of dollars that lawmakers refused to approve to build a wall along the border with Mexico. He once again empowered the military to support the Border Patrol with logistical planning, drone support and help procuring detention space.\n\nBut in a separate order, Mr. Trump appeared to go further by giving the military a specific responsibility over immigration enforcement. During Mr. Trump's first term, the military only supported immigration authorities but did not apprehend migrants. Mr. Trump now directed the Defense Department to come up with a plan in 30 days \"to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the United States by repelling forms of invasion, including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities.\"\n\nWhile details on the exact plans remained unclear, the directive for the military could run afoul of laws that limit the use of regular federal troops for domestic policing purposes.\n\nAs he did in his first term, Mr. Trump relied on the National Emergencies Act, a post-Watergate law that allows the president to declare a national emergency, which enhances his executive powers. The act was intended to enable the federal government to respond quickly to a crisis by creating exemptions to rules that would normally constrain the president.\n\n\"The president has a pretty wide latitude in determining what constitutes a national emergency,\" said Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University. \"If they say it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, well, unless the courts say otherwise, it's a duck.\"\n\nThe law requires that the president inform Congress which statutes he is using as a basis to invoke specific emergency powers. In 2019, Mr. Trump relied on a law that permitted the executive branch to use military construction funds in a declared national emergency.\n\nCongress is limited in what it can do to stop a president from using his emergency powers. Under the National Emergencies Act , the House and the Senate can pass a joint resolution to end the emergency status if they believe that the president is acting irresponsibly or the threat has dissipated. The law says that if one chamber passes such a measure, the other must bring it up in 18 days.\n\nBut Republicans control both chambers of Congress, making it extremely unlikely that Mr. Trump would face pushback from the legislative branch. He could also veto any joint congressional resolution terminating the national emergency.\n\nJudges temporarily blocked, and subsequently restarted, Mr. Trump's use of military funds for border wall construction on multiple occasions before President Joseph R. Biden Jr. came into office and terminated Mr. Trump's emergency declaration.\n\nThe border has also been particularly calm in recent days , especially when compared with the numbers seen a year ago, a development that could undermine Mr. Trump's assertion that an emergency exists. But that might not matter. The Justice Department is likely to argue in any litigation that the courts should defer to the president's determination.\n\nEric Schmitt contributed reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nPresident Trump is currently speaking at the Commander-in-Chief inaugural ball celebrating the U.S. armed forces after participating in a traditional first dance at the event.\n\n\"As I said in my Inaugural Address, we will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars we end and perhaps most importantly the wars we never get into,\" Trump said at the black-tie event.\n\nShawn McCreesh\n\nAfter making two speeches at the Capitol, holding a rally, and giving a freewheeling press conference held from behind the Resolute Desk while signing an astonishing number of executive orders, President Trump is now waving a military sword around in the air while dancing to Village People. There's still an hour to go left in this day.\n\nErica L. Green and Zach Montague\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday ordered his administration to gut policies instituted under the Biden administration to prevent sex discrimination and protect transgender Americans, and dismantle federal programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nMr. Trump's actions, part of a blitz of orders that he signed on his first day in office, assert that the government will now defend women against \"gender ideology extremism\" by reversing \"efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex.\" They also call for ending D.E.I. programs and the \"termination of all discriminatory programs\" in the government, including in federal employment practices.\n\nThe executive orders included a mix of administrative measures, such as changing government forms to include only two genders, as well as assertions dismissing the validity of gender identity entirely. A gender identity other than the one assigned at birth, an order said, \"reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self\" and \"does not provide a meaningful basis for identification.\"\n\nThe actions also effectively shut down an array of programs and practices aimed at reversing decades of systemic inequities and discriminatory practices that have disproportionately affected Black people and other underserved communities.\n\nUnder the orders, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Performance and Personnel Management will coordinate on changing hiring practices, ending equity-focused programs and grants and terminating \"chief diversity officer\" positions designated during the Biden administration.\n\nThe orders deliver on Mr. Trump's promise to eradicate what his allies consider to be \"wokeism\" in the federal government, a term that conservatives use to describe racial justice and civil rights advocacy. They are part of an effort that he took up in his first term by rolling back policies boosting affirmative action and transgender rights.\n\nIn his Inaugural Address on Monday, Mr. Trump vowed to stop efforts to \"socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that he was being inaugurated on Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday and said he would \"not forget\" that he had gained support among Hispanic and Black voters in the November election.\n\n\"We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nHis actions on Monday are also aimed at bringing back \"biological truth\" to the federal government, according to a Trump official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the orders before they were signed.\n\nMr. Trump ordered federal agencies to recognize a biological, binary definition of sex - male or female and not interchangeable. The government will also eliminate references to gender identity in policy documents, and will order that government-issued documents, including passports and visas, accurately reflect one's biological sex.\n\nOn the first day of his presidency in 2021, Mr. Biden took an essentially opposite position, directing agencies to include sexual orientation and gender identity in any regulations and policies covering workplace discrimination, formalizing protections for L.G.B.T.Q. workers. He extended those directions to schools and students last year.\n\nThe order also prohibits the use of federal funds for any use in \"promoting gender ideology\" through grants or other government programming, as well as the use of public funding for transition-related medical procedures in prisons .\n\nPerhaps the most pointed part of the directive instructs agencies to protect \"intimate single-sex spaces,\" such as prisons and rape shelters, by denying access to transgender women.\n\nThe Trump official said the changes were all aimed at promoting the privacy and safety of women, who the official said had suffered under attempts to cater to transgender workers and students.\n\nElements of Mr. Trump's orders were written to explicitly target education institutions, rolling back actions taken during the Biden administration that extended protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, incoming officials told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe Biden administration had instructed schools that Title IX of the Civil Rights Act , which protects students against discrimination based on sex, afforded the same protections to transgender students against discrimination based on their gender identity.\n\nMr. Trump's executive actions will undo that policy. The order directs his attorney general to release guidance stating that a Supreme Court decision in 2020 that cemented stronger civil rights protections to transgender workers does not apply to schools and their students, echoing a ruling by a federal judge earlier this month.\n\nAt a rally on Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated his intent to minimize the role of the federal government in steering education policy, saying that he instructed his pick for education secretary, Linda McMahon, to return much authority over the nation's schools to state legislatures.\n\n\"If you do a great job, you will put yourself out of a job, because you'll be sending it back to the states,\" he said he had told Ms. McMahon.\n\nBut the executive orders issued on Monday demonstrated the extent to which the Trump administration intends to use the power of the executive branch to compel schools and educators to conform to its vision for social policy.\n\nIn his previous administration, Mr. Trump railed against efforts to teach children about slavery and his conservative allies supported the movement to remove books about race and gender from school libraries. He indicated on Monday that the enforcement power of the Education Department would be critical to bringing change to the nation's schools.\n\n\"We have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them,\" Mr. Trump said during his Inaugural Address. \"All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\"\n\nOn his first day of office, Mr. Biden unveiled a racial equity agenda after vowing during his inauguration speech to defeat \"white supremacy.\"\n\nMr. Biden ordered agencies to take sweeping steps to address inequity in housing, criminal justice, voting rights, health care, education and economic mobility. His administration also created new offices, like one dedicated to civil rights and environmental justice at the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Trump's order specifically targets Mr. Biden's \"environmental justice\" office and personnel for review.\n\nMr. Trump's first act in office was to rescind executive orders issued by Mr. Biden including ones he signed on his first day in office in 2021, \"advancing racial equity and supporting underserved communities\" and \"preventing discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.\"\n\nThe orders were widely seen as cornerstones of Mr. Biden's civil rights legacy, and infused policy efforts across his administration.\n\nBut some of Mr. Biden's efforts, including the Title IX rules and an Agriculture Department program designed to provide disaster relief to minority farmers, ran into legal roadblocks after critics contended that by aiding one group of people, they inherently harmed others.\n\nThe Trump official said that it was fitting that the administration was taking measures on the King holiday to reinstitute equal treatment by eliminating racial \"preferences\" and diversity programming.\n\nThe orders on diversity and gender fit within Mr. Trump's larger goal of bringing back \"American values,\" as laid out in a White House statement on Monday on the president's early priorities.\n\nMr. Trump touched on the theme in his address, again raising a recent promise to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\" and proposing to officially rename North America's tallest peak Mount McKinley after its name had been changed to Denali - its Alaska Native name - under President Barack Obama in 2015.\n\nEileen Sullivan\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other immigrant rights groups sued the Trump administration over its hours-old executive order to stop conferring citizenship to anyone born in the United States. The lawsuit was filed in New Hampshire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nAmong the executive orders Trump signed today was an order restoring the federal death penalty - although President Biden commuted the death sentences of all but three of the prisoners who were on the federal death row. Trump's order also mandates the use of the death penalty in any case where someone is convicted of murdering a law enforcement officer or if an undocumented migrant is convicted of a crime that is eligible for the death penalty.\n\nMatina Stevis-Gridneff\n\nCanada's finance minister responded late Monday to President Trump's statement that he was still planning to impose tariffs of 25 percent on Canadian goods on Feb. 1, even though the new president did not immediately sign a tariff executive order after taking office earlier in the day. \"Our country is absolutely ready to respond to any one of these scenarios,\" Dominic LeBlanc said. \"We still continue to believe that it would be a mistake.\"\n\nLuke Broadwater\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nLeaders in the Democratic Party were swift to condemn President Trump's pardons and commutations of more than 1,500 defendants arrested in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, including the leaders of extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.\n\nMr. Trump's fellow Republicans were noticeably silent.\n\nMr. Trump's decision on Monday delivered broad clemency to nearly all of the 1,600 rioters charged with joining the Capitol attack and commuted the sentences of several others. His decision appeared to cover both people accused of low-level, nonviolent offenses that day and those who committed violence.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi, still one of the most influential figures in the Democratic Party, condemned the pardons as an \"outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol, the Congress and the Constitution.\"\n\n\"It is shameful that the president has decided to make one of his top priorities the abandonment and betrayal of police officers who put their lives on the line to stop an attempt to subvert the peaceful transfer of power,\" Ms. Pelosi said.\n\nFor years, Mr. Trump and his allies have tried to rewrite the narrative around the assault on the Capitol, during which a pro-Trump mob assaulted the police, smashed windows and ransacked offices. Mr. Trump took the final step in lending support to the defendants on Monday by wiping their records clean and portraying them as victims, or even \"hostages\" of what he has repeatedly cast as an unfair justice system.\n\n\"Republicans cannot claim to be the party of law and order while pardoning and commuting the sentences of individuals who brutally assaulted law enforcement officers in service of a violent insurrection,\" said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, adding: \"These defendants were convicted by a jury of their peers for participating in an attack that included direct assaults on law enforcement, vandalism, trespassing, and an attempt to overturn a free and fair election through the use of force.\"\n\nThe assault on the Capitol has created a political dynamic in which Republicans, who often cast themselves as the party of law and order, have taken the side of rioters who attacked the police, said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado.\n\n\"President Trump's pardon of Jan. 6 insurrectionists disrespects the police who fought & died to protect the Capitol,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nAfter the attack on the Capitol, 10 House Republicans voted to impeach Mr. Trump over the assault and seven Republican senators voted to convict him. But one by one, most of them have left Congress as Mr. Trump tightened his grip on the party. Only two of those House members and three senators remain in Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQasim Nauman\n\nHere is a copy of President Trump's proclamation granting clemency to Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nKaroun Demirjian\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order to make border security a priority for the military, a directive that could allow U.S. troops to assume a direct role in immigration enforcement and test longstanding legal limits on deploying armed forces on American soil.\n\nBefore taking office, Mr. Trump promised to redeploy thousands of service members to the U.S. border with Mexico. He pledged to use at least the National Guard, and possibly draw from other branches of the armed forces as well, to achieve his goal of keeping migrants out of the United States and deporting those who entered without authorization.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the southern border, a move that had some precedent in previous administrations.\n\nBut by declaring border security to be a priority for the military as a whole, the president's directive could put his administration on a collision course with laws intended to prevent presidents from using their power as commander in chief to turn the military against U.S. civilians.\n\nHere's what to know about the order, and how it could play out.\n\nMr. Trump's order directs the defense secretary to make border security part of the mission of U.S. Northern Command, sealing U.S. borders and \"repelling forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and tracking, and other criminal activities.\"\n\nThe order gives the defense secretary 30 days to come up with a plan for how to execute the mission. The directive does not specify exactly which branches of the armed forces ought to be deployed to aid in such a mission, leaving those determinations to military leaders.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 forbids the use of armed forces for law enforcement purposes on U.S. soil, unless Congress or the Constitution expressly authorizes it.\n\nWhile the prohibition is seemingly straightforward, some have argued that its limits would not apply if service members were deployed inside the country for military purposes, as opposed to law enforcement ones.\n\nJohn Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general in President George W. Bush's administration who held expansive views of presidential powers, argued for this standard in a 2001 Justice Department memorandum on using the military to fight terrorism domestically.\n\nMr. Trump's declaration that border security is a function of the U.S. military suggests that his administration holds a similar view of the posse comitatus restrictions - and how to sidestep them.\n\nThe law's restrictions also do not apply to the National Guard, so long as the units remain under the command of state governors.\n\nThe main exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the Insurrection Act. The more than 200-year-old law grants the president power to deploy the military domestically when faced with \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" that prevent the execution of federal or state laws.\n\nThat broad power has been invoked about 30 times in U.S. history, including by President Abraham Lincoln when seven Confederate states seceded, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower to enforce the desegregation of schools in Little Rock, Ark. Most recently, President George H.W. Bush used it in 1992 to send troops into Los Angeles at the request of California's governor in an effort to quell race riots that followed the police beating of Rodney King.\n\nMr. Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term to put down racial justice riots that broke out across the country after the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by white police officers. Mark T. Esper, Mr. Trump's defense secretary at the time, strongly opposed the idea, as did Gen. Mark A. Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798 lets the president expel foreign nationals of an enemy nation who are 14 or older. While the law has been invoked only during times of war, presidents can use it for \"any invasion or predatory incursion.\" Mr. Trump has frequently referred to the unlawful flow of migrants and drugs into the United States as an \"invasion.\"\n\nThe president also declared a national emergency on Monday to fund and outfit the military's involvement in his deportation effort, and augment the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to obtain \"complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.\" During his first term, Mr. Trump used an emergency declaration to circumvent Congress and redirect funds to pay for the construction of a border wall.\n\nAnd while U.S. law forbids using service members for law enforcement activities, it doesn't preclude them from performing support functions for law enforcement, including logistics, machinery, intelligence, maintenance and training.\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.\n\nGlenn Thrush\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nThe effort to prosecute the violent mob that ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the leaders of far-right groups who egged them on, represented the biggest and most logistically complex investigation in the history of the Justice Department.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump erased it in an instant on Inauguration Day.\n\nMr. Trump has denounced the Jan. 6 prosecutions as part of a Democratic witch hunt. In reality, they were initiated and overseen by his handpicked U.S. attorney in Washington and the F.B.I. director. They had the support of many Republicans, including Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who said, \"Those who planned and participated in the violence that day should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nMr. Trump's decision to offer full pardons to nearly all of the almost 1,600 rioters and rally organizers implicated in the breach of the Capitol was expected. Still, it sent a shock wave among current and former prosecutors who believe his release of prisoners, whom he calls \"hostages,\" undermines the rule of law.\n\n\"It's a gross misuse of the pardon power, and says that Trump is willing to meddle in a process that helped strengthen the rule of law,\" said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney in Alabama during the Obama administration.\n\nMatthew M. Graves, who stepped down as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia this month after overseeing many of those prosecutions, said he believed the Trump pardons would \"prevent the department from prosecuting the hundreds charged with, or wanted for, assaulting law enforcement officers and reduce the sentences of those convicted of such assaults.\"\n\nMr. Graves, who took over the high-profile post in November 2021, said his office had also brought charges of political violence against left-wing activists such as climate protesters and people who engaged in disruptive demonstrations against the war in Gaza.\n\n\"The question becomes, will their acts of political violence and destruction also be pardoned and if not, why not?\" he asked in an interview on Monday night.\n\nStill, he added, \"there is no undoing these prosecutions, and hundreds have already completed their sentences or completed all or most of their periods of probation.\"\n\nThe shocking attack on the Capitol was the most significant hostile breach of the national legislature since the War of 1812. It threatened to overwhelm the local U.S. attorney's office, which at the time was ill-equipped to process evidence and witnesses for hundreds of cases involving possible perpetrators from around the country.\n\nTo meet the need, the office, then led by Trump appointee Michael R. Sherwin, began to organize an investigation that would soon pull in dozens of prosecutors on loan from around the country. To bring the cases, prosecutors had to devise a new system to collect, store and analyze a monumental volume of cellphone video that became a model for similar platforms now being used to bring war crimes cases.\n\nThe announcement of the pardons came amid questions about the fate of the department at a time when Mr. Trump has vowed to punish anyone, including prosecutors or political opponents, involved in the efforts to hold him accountable for his actions in the aftermath of his loss in the 2020 election.\n\n\"The scales of justice will be rebalanced,\" Mr. Trump said near the start of his Inaugural Address. \"The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamed Aleaziz\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order suspending refugee resettlement in the United States, picking up where he left off in his first term with his efforts to kill a program that offers safe harbor to people around the world facing threats and persecution.\n\nHe has long railed against refugees, claiming that the program floods the country with undesirable people and allows terrorists and other dangerous people into the United States.\n\n\"The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees,\" the executive order reads.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump broke down the U.S. refugee apparatus, decimating a system that had bipartisan support and had been largely untouched for years as he slashed the number of refugees admitted to the country.\n\nHere is what to know about the refugee program, and how Mr. Trump is changing it.\n\nMr. Trump's order suspends refugee resettlement as of next Monday. The order directs top leaders in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to issue a report to him every 90 days thereafter to allow him to assess whether the refugee program \"would be in the interests of the United States,\" according to the order.\n\nForeign nationals seeking to resettle as refugees in the United States face a rigorous and extensive screening process that often lasts for years , which includes security and medical vetting; scrutiny of their families and those with whom they have associated; and interviews with American officials overseas.\n\nUnder the law, U.S. officials can reject anyone who the government \"knows, or has reasonable ground to believe\" will or could commit a terrorist act. But they also have discretion to deny individuals based on mere suspicions.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Mr. Trump put in place even stricter checks for refugees from 11 countries it deemed \"high risk.\"\n\nPresidents have the power to single-handedly determine the number of refugees allowed into the country. Every year, the president, in consultation with Congress, sets a numerical cap for refugee admissions that year.\n\nSince the refugee program began in earnest in 1980, the annual cap has been high, regardless of the party holding the White House. For example, in his final year as president, George W. Bush admitted around 60,000 refugees in 2008 after setting a cap of 80,000.\n\nWhen he first took office in 2017, Mr. Trump initially paused the refugee program. Then, he used the annual cap to sharply cut the number of refugees allowed into the country. By the end of his administration, he proposed capping the number of refugees at 15,000, the lowest number in the more than 40-year history of the program.\n\nThe cuts all but destroyed refugee resettlement in the United States. The network of organizations that support refugees when they first enter the country shrank because they had so many fewer people to serve. The number of government officials assigned to the program also slimmed during those years, to 107 from 170.\n\nIn 2020, the last year of Mr. Trump's first term, just over 11,000 refugees were admitted into the United States - a precipitous drop from the more than 80,000 that were admitted in the year before he took office.\n\nPresident Joseph R. Biden Jr. slowly restored the refugee resettlement operation during his four years in office, hiring more officers and prompting the opening of offices across the country to serve them. Around 150 offices opened as of last year.\n\nBy 2024, the United States had allowed more than 100,000 refugees to enter the country, the highest total in three decades.\n\nThat number will almost assuredly drop in 2025.\n\nTheodore Schleifer\n\nThe general structure of the executive order setting up the Department of Government Efficiency broadly tracks with what we reported in this article . The agency is part of the U.S. Digital Service, and essentially takes it over. The agency is composed also of landing teams at federal agencies, although the Trump executive order says it will now be four-per-agency, not two. And the work will be carried out in part by special government employees, who come in to agencies for just a few months at a time. Questions remain in the executive order, though, including who is the so-called \"administrator\" of the program? Elon Musk himself?\n\nJulian E. Barnes and Devlin Barrett\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order stripping the security clearances of former intelligence officials who in 2020 signed a letter that said the spread of emails from Hunter Biden's laptop had \"the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"\n\nThe order also revoked any security clearances held by John Bolton, who served as a national security adviser in the first Trump administration, but earned the president's ire for publishing a book about his time in office. The executive order said Mr. Bolton wrote a \"reckless\" book that included sensitive information that should not have been published.\n\nThe executive order, first reported by Axios, was the brainchild of John Ratcliffe, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, according to two Trump administration officials.\n\nIt is unclear how many of the 51 people who signed the letter still have active clearances. Former officials said that most of them had allowed their clearances to lapse years ago and that the order was purely performative. But at least some of the former officials have advisory contracts with intelligence agencies or the military. They could lose those contracts without security clearances, according to former officials.\n\nThe signees included prominent intelligence leaders, including Leon Panetta and John Brennan, who served as C.I.A. directors in the Obama administration; Mike Hayden, a C.I.A. director in the Bush administration; and James Clapper, a director of national intelligence in the Obama administration. Mr. Trump previously revoked Mr. Brennan's security clearance in his first administration.\n\nSome had been critics of the first Trump administration and of Mr. Trump's treatment of the intelligence agencies.\n\nThe order accused them of effectively suppressing information the American people needed to know during the election.\n\n\"The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions,\" the order said.\n\nSeveral signees said Mr. Trump was misreading the letter that was carefully crafted to warn of possible manipulation.\n\nTrump has long resented that both social media companies and the intelligence establishment were quick to suggest that the emails from Mr. Biden's laptop were disinformation.\n\nAfter The New York Post wrote about the content of the emails , some social media companies moved to block links to the story. But no evidence has emerged that showed the emails from the laptop had been altered by a foreign government.\n\nWhen tapping Mr. Ratcliffe for the C.I.A., Mr. Trump used social media to praise him for criticizing the letter from the former intelligence officials. Mr. Ratcliffe highlighted his criticism of the letter in his confirmation process, saying that time had validated his assessments when he was director of national intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlie Savage\n\nInvoking emergency power and national security, Trump has issued an order barring asylum for people newly arriving at the Southern border. As a seemingly overlapping move, it also says undocumented migrants are ineligible for asylum if they do not provide federal officials, before entering the United States, \"with sufficient medical information and reliable criminal history and background information\" for vetting.\n\nHamed Aleaziz\n\nOne of President Trump's executive orders signed Monday night directs both the Department of Homeland Security secretary and the attorney general to make sure sanctuary jurisdictions are not given federal funds. The order also directs his leaders to encourage undocumented immigrants to leave the country and directs the Homeland Security Department to increase partnerships with local law enforcement on immigration enforcement.\n\nBrent McDonald and Whitney Shefte\n\nOutside the D.C. Central Detention Facility - where a number of people convicted of crimes on Jan. 6 are being held - we filmed a group of relatives, advocates and former Jan. 6 defendants watching live as President Trump announced that he would grant clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol.\n\nA former Jan. 6 inmate who spent time inside the jail described it as a \"joyous moment.\"\n\ntranscript\n\n\"President Trump has made it clear that by midnight they will release all of the J6ers across the country. Any veteran that was homeless, that was in struggle or a prisoner of war underneath this time in the J6 gulags will be received and not only be celebrated, they will no longer just be tolerated. We are so grateful to President Trump. Promises made, promises kept. Promises made, promises kept.\" \"This is such a joyous moment. But it's also bittersweet because I have brothers in there that have done years of their lives in there - years. Forty-five months for me, and I'm fortunate that I'm out here able to welcome my brothers and my sisters out. It is a very emotional day for me. We can never allow this to happen to another American again.\"\n\nZach Montague\n\nTrump's order related to sex and gender instructs the Justice Department to issue guidance on the legality of single-sex spaces, which will be instrumental to any coming efforts to rescind Biden-era regulations extending protections to transgender students at schools receiving federal funds through Title IX. Chief among those protections was that denying students access to facilities consistent with their gender identity could be considered a form of discrimination under the Civil Rights Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nThe entire crowd outside the D.C. jail just rushed across the street to the doors of the facility after someone apparently announced they saw a detainee who was going to be released through the glass doors, creating a few minutes of chaos. Police on foot scrambled to push them back.\n\nIt's unclear whether anyone is actually going to be released.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nTrump declared earlier today that he would immediately declare Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, but the executive order that the White House just published outlined a longer process of officials making \"a recommendation \" about doing so within the next two weeks.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nThe order also instructs Trump's cabinet to make preparations for him to potentially invoke the Alien Enemies Act. Trump repeatedly promised to use that law to deport suspected members of drug cartels and criminal gangs without due process.\n\nAndrew Duehren\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order challenging an international agreement the Biden administration had negotiated to try and stop large multinational corporations from booking profits in countries with low taxes.\n\nMr. Trump directed his administration to tell the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international body that facilitated the deal, that the agreement had no force in the United States without an act of Congress. In 2021, more than 130 countries signed onto the agreement, which included a new 15 percent minimum tax companies are supposed to pay in every country where they operate.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's order will have little immediate impact on the taxation of multinational companies. The agreement had already run into trouble in the United States - Republicans have long abhorred the international tax deal, and Democrats failed to make the necessary changes to American tax law to bring the United States into compliance with the deal when they controlled Congress.\n\nThat failure has left American companies vulnerable to a key enforcement provision in the agreement. Under the deal, American companies could face higher taxes overseas because the United States did not put into place the 15 percent minimum tax. Some jurisdictions, including the European Union, have moved forward with the minimum tax.\n\nThe possibility of American companies paying higher taxes to European nations, for example, had enraged Republicans, who threatened to charge retaliatory taxes on countries that enforced the rules. Mr. Trump's order directs the Treasury secretary and the United States Trade Representative to examine whether any countries are targeting taxes at American companies and prepare economic measures in response.\n\nMr. Trump's order could help spur a new round of negotiations over international taxation, which has been an irritant among major economies for years. Those talks would take place as America's economic partners are navigating Mr. Trump's threats to dramatically raise tariffs on their exports to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Trump Pardons Jan. 6 Rioters and Signs Order on TikTok\n\nTrump Administration\n\nThe president ordered the withdrawal of the country from the Paris climate agreement and took action on immigration policy and other issues such as creating the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\ntranscript\n\n\"So I am revoking nearly 80 destructive, radical executive actions of the previous administration, they'll all be null and void within about what, five minutes. Is that them over there? Five minutes.\" \"The first item that President Trump is signing is the rescission of 78 Biden era executive actions, executive orders, presidential memoranda and others.\" [cheering] \"Thank you, sir.\" [cheering] \"The next item here is the withdrawal from the Paris climate treaty.\" [cheering]\n\nNoah Weiland and Maggie Haberman\n\nPresident Trump on Monday pardoned members of the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and signed dozens of executive orders addressing the first priorities of his administration.\n\nMr. Trump gave sweeping pardons to nearly all of the 1,600 rioters charged with storming the Capitol and commuted the sentences of several others. His decision appears to cover both people accused of low-level, nonviolent offenses that day and those who committed violence.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump's first executive orders froze most federal hiring, halted new federal rule-making and revoked roughly 80 executive orders issued by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\nWithdrawing from pacts: Among the orders Mr. Trump signed were a pair ordering the country to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and from the World Health Organization .\n\nTikTok ban: Mr. Trump said he had signed an executive order to stall a federal ban of the app. The order told the attorney general not to enforce the law for 75 days to give the Trump administration \"an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward.\" Read more ›\n\nAdministrative actions: Some of the first administrative actions of the Trump administration took place around the time of Mr. Trump's inaugural speech. Federal officials shut down a government app that allows migrants to schedule appointments to use ports of entry, an option that almost a million immigrants used while it was active.\n\nReturn to the office: Mr. Trump also ordered federal workers to return full time to in-person work. His hiring freeze also specifically targeted the Internal Revenue Service .\n\nBirthright citizenship: Mr. Trump signed an executive order defining birthright citizenship. The president cannot change the Constitution on his own, but he has made it clear he wants to deny birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, to the children of noncitizens. It is all but certain to be challenged in court.\n\nBiden pardons: Mr. Trump expressed displeasure about a last-minute wave of pre-emptive pardons issued by President Biden to protect some of Mr. Trump's adversaries, including Gen. Mark A. Milley. Two of those pardoned, Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, and former Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, thanked Mr. Biden, saying they had been pardoned \"not for breaking the law but for upholding it.\"\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nThe crowd cheered and the music blared.\n\nOn Monday night outside the D.C. jail, some of the family members, fervent supporters and former detainees gathered there swiveled their hips and pumped their fists to a remix of \"Y.M.C.A.,\" in a scene reminiscent of a Trump rally.\n\nThey were there to celebrate President Trump's broad grant of clemency to nearly all 1,600 Jan. 6 defendants, though only a dozen of those pardoned remained in this particular jail on the morning of his inauguration. The nightly vigil, which has lasted for close to two and a half years, has served as the emotional epicenter of support for those who have been prosecuted in connection with the violent attack on the Capitol four years ago.\n\nMicki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt , an Air Force veteran who was fatally shot by the police as rioters tried to storm the building on Jan. 6, 2021, typically kicked off the gathering with a roll call of all the detainees across the country. But not on Monday.\n\n\"We're going to skip that tonight because it's just a variable,\" Ms. Witthoeft said. \"Everybody's getting out.\"\n\nOnly two men, Andrew and Matthew Valentin, brothers who were sentenced just days ago, walked free on Monday, according to Paul Ingrassia, the newly appointed White House liaison to the Justice Department.\n\nBrandon Fellows , 30, who served time at the D.C. jail after being convicted of, among other charges, obstructing the certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s electoral victory, addressed the crowd. Mr. Fellows, who was photographed smoking marijuana in the office of Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, stressed that those who would be leaving prison had a long road ahead.\n\n\"Please keep in mind, the people that are coming out, it's going to be a little rough - it's going to be tough,\" Mr. Fellows said.\n\nMary Pollock, 24, had accompanied her father from Florida in hopes of reuniting with her siblings, Olivia and Jonathan Pollock , who were being held at the jail after they broke the terms of their release two years ago by going on the run.\n\n\"They've kept their spirits up in there,\" she said. \"They've been encouraging the other J6 prisoners.\"\n\nThe scene outside the jail was a departure from the usual vigil held in the back of the facility, under windows that the detainees can peer out of. Men and women who were imprisoned and their families called supporters throughout the night, updating them on the status of their release - but also to proclaim their innocence, as they ordinarily do.\n\nThe crowd had been buoyed by Mr. Trump's promise to issue sweeping pardons on Day 1 of his presidency. They were already anticipating the fulfillment of another vow of his, to pursue his rivals by prosecuting them. Mr. Trump told NBC News in December that the entire Jan. 6 committee \"should go to jail.\"\n\n\"They need to sit in that jail - not the innocent people,\" said Tia Myers, 53, from Fort Thomas, Kentucky, who said she was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and was investigated by the F.B.I. although she did not go inside the building.\n\nMany at the rally sought to rewrite the violent history of the Jan. 6 attack, a narrative that Mr. Trump himself has endorsed at rallies, in news conferences and on television.\n\n\"We saw the cops waving everybody in,\" Ms. Myers said of herself and others who had come to the Capitol that day out of a false conviction that Mr. Trump had won the 2020 election. She quickly added, \"We didn't go in, obviously.\"\n\nScott Tapley, from Goshen, Ind., who brought his two adult daughters to Washington for the inauguration, as he did four years ago to watch Mr. Trump address his supporters on Ellipse on Jan. 6, said the people who had gone inside did so to protest \"peacefully and patriotically,\" only to be treated unfairly by the justice system.\n\n\"I'm so glad to see they're being released,\" Mr. Tapley said. \"This is just an unspeakably joyous, happy day.\"\n\nEven before Mr. Trump formally issued his pardons, Peyton, 20, and Sarah Reffitt, 28, were more reserved in expressing their joy. As the daughters of Guy Reffitt, a member of the Texas Three Percenters militia who was the first person to be charged with a crime for Jan. 6, they had seen their lives upended by the events of that day.\n\nPeyton, tears in her eyes, said she wished her father, who was currently detained in Oklahoma, was home so she could annoy him. But her family had a lot of healing to do, she added - her brother, Jackson, had turned her father in to the authorities and their home was raided 10 days after the attack on the Capitol.\n\nShe said she believed that her father should be held accountable, but she worried that his time in jail and her mother's desire to free him were \"toxic.\"\n\n\"Everything else was taken and this is what they were left with.\" She added, \"They can't just walk away - it's sad.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nIn the first late-night social media post of his second term, President Trump said that his administration was in the process of removing \"over a thousand\" Biden administration appointees who had not already resigned.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nTrump named four such appointees in the post, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who had served on the President's National Infrastructure Advisory Council.\n\n\"YOU'RE FIRED!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nNo one else would be released from the D.C. jail today, Sergeant Michael Bowman from Washington's Metropolitan Police Department told the crowd outside in an attempt to get people to go home. Two Jan. 6 detainees were released from the facility earlier, according to a Trump administration official.\n\nHamed Aleaziz\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump moved on Monday to toss out a Biden-era program that allowed migrants fleeing four troubled nations to fly into the United States and remain in the country temporarily, part of a sweeping first-day crackdown on immigration.\n\nThe program, known as humanitarian parole and introduced by the Biden administration in early 2023, allowed migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela to fly into the United States if they had a financial sponsor and passed security checks. Migrants who entered under the program could stay for up to two years, unless they found other ways to stay long term.\n\nAs of late last year, more than 500,000 migrants had entered the country through the initiative.\n\nTrump wants to end several programs that offered new arrivals temporary relief. Millions of others without legal status may also be vulnerable to deportation.\n\nThe program, which Mr. Trump ordered the head of the Department of Homeland Security to end, served as one of two major legal pathways the Biden administration put in place to try to discourage migrants from crossing into the country illegally. The Trump administration already moved earlier Monday to shut down the other program - a government app that allowed migrants to schedule appointments to enter the country at legal ports of entry.\n\n\"These processes - a safe and orderly way to reach the United States - have resulted in a significant reduction in the number of these individuals encountered at our southern border,\" Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the Biden administration's homeland security secretary, said last spring. \"It is a key element of our efforts to address the unprecedented level of migration throughout our hemisphere.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers viewed the program as a way for migrants with no other access to the United States a chance to enter the country for up to two years and obtain work permits.\n\n\"Here's an idea: Don't fly millions of illegals aliens from failed states thousands of miles away into small towns across the American Heartland,\" Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump's immigration policy, said on social media in September.\n\nTexas, along with other Republican-led states, sued to end the program and failed. But the Biden administration had already said in October that it would allow the permission for migrants from the four countries to lapse after their two years ran out, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to find other methods to stay in the country or face deportation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlan Feuer\n\nJust hours after Trump's sweeping Jan. 6 pardons were issued, his new U.S. attorney in Washington, Ed Martin, started dismissing some cases stemming from the Capitol attack, court papers show. Martin has long been an advocate for Jan. 6 defendants and has ties to the Patriot Freedom Project, one of the largest legal fundraising groups for the rioters.\n\nAlan Feuer\n\nOne of the cases that Martin has moved to dismiss is the trial of Jared Wise, a former F.B.I. agent charged with felony civil disorder and assault. Prosecutors say that Wise confronted officers at the Capitol, calling them Nazis and encouraging a mob of Trump supporters to kill them.\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nPaul Ingrassia, the newly appointed White House liaison to the Justice Department, just arrived outside the D.C. jail and spoke to the crowd that had gathered in anticipation that Jan. 6 detainees could be released. Wearing a tuxedo and red scarf, he said that two men from the D.C. facility had already been released: brothers Andrew and Matthew Valentin. According to news reports, they were sentenced just days earlier.\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border on Monday, invoking special presidential powers that allow him to unilaterally unlock federal funding for border wall construction and potentially to deploy the military and National Guard to the border.\n\nMr. Trump took a similar step during his first term as a way to circumvent Congress and access billions of dollars that lawmakers refused to approve to build a wall along the border with Mexico. He once again empowered the military to support the Border Patrol with logistical planning, drone support and help procuring detention space.\n\nBut in a separate order, Mr. Trump appeared to go further by giving the military a specific responsibility over immigration enforcement. During Mr. Trump's first term, the military only supported immigration authorities but did not apprehend migrants. Mr. Trump now directed the Defense Department to come up with a plan in 30 days \"to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the United States by repelling forms of invasion, including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities.\"\n\nWhile details on the exact plans remained unclear, the directive for the military could run afoul of laws that limit the use of regular federal troops for domestic policing purposes.\n\nAs he did in his first term, Mr. Trump relied on the National Emergencies Act, a post-Watergate law that allows the president to declare a national emergency, which enhances his executive powers. The act was intended to enable the federal government to respond quickly to a crisis by creating exemptions to rules that would normally constrain the president.\n\n\"The president has a pretty wide latitude in determining what constitutes a national emergency,\" said Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University. \"If they say it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, well, unless the courts say otherwise, it's a duck.\"\n\nThe law requires that the president inform Congress which statutes he is using as a basis to invoke specific emergency powers. In 2019, Mr. Trump relied on a law that permitted the executive branch to use military construction funds in a declared national emergency.\n\nCongress is limited in what it can do to stop a president from using his emergency powers. Under the National Emergencies Act , the House and the Senate can pass a joint resolution to end the emergency status if they believe that the president is acting irresponsibly or the threat has dissipated. The law says that if one chamber passes such a measure, the other must bring it up in 18 days.\n\nBut Republicans control both chambers of Congress, making it extremely unlikely that Mr. Trump would face pushback from the legislative branch. He could also veto any joint congressional resolution terminating the national emergency.\n\nJudges temporarily blocked, and subsequently restarted, Mr. Trump's use of military funds for border wall construction on multiple occasions before President Joseph R. Biden Jr. came into office and terminated Mr. Trump's emergency declaration.\n\nThe border has also been particularly calm in recent days , especially when compared with the numbers seen a year ago, a development that could undermine Mr. Trump's assertion that an emergency exists. But that might not matter. The Justice Department is likely to argue in any litigation that the courts should defer to the president's determination.\n\nEric Schmitt contributed reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nPresident Trump is currently speaking at the Commander-in-Chief inaugural ball celebrating the U.S. armed forces after participating in a traditional first dance at the event.\n\n\"As I said in my Inaugural Address, we will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars we end and perhaps most importantly the wars we never get into,\" Trump said at the black-tie event.\n\nShawn McCreesh\n\nAfter making two speeches at the Capitol, holding a rally, and giving a freewheeling press conference held from behind the Resolute Desk while signing an astonishing number of executive orders, President Trump is now waving a military sword around in the air while dancing to Village People. There's still an hour to go left in this day.\n\nErica L. Green and Zach Montague\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday ordered his administration to gut policies instituted under the Biden administration to prevent sex discrimination and protect transgender Americans, and dismantle federal programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nMr. Trump's actions, part of a blitz of orders that he signed on his first day in office, assert that the government will now defend women against \"gender ideology extremism\" by reversing \"efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex.\" They also call for ending D.E.I. programs and the \"termination of all discriminatory programs\" in the government, including in federal employment practices.\n\nThe executive orders included a mix of administrative measures, such as changing government forms to include only two genders, as well as assertions dismissing the validity of gender identity entirely. A gender identity other than the one assigned at birth, an order said, \"reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self\" and \"does not provide a meaningful basis for identification.\"\n\nThe actions also effectively shut down an array of programs and practices aimed at reversing decades of systemic inequities and discriminatory practices that have disproportionately affected Black people and other underserved communities.\n\nUnder the orders, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Performance and Personnel Management will coordinate on changing hiring practices, ending equity-focused programs and grants and terminating \"chief diversity officer\" positions designated during the Biden administration.\n\nThe orders deliver on Mr. Trump's promise to eradicate what his allies consider to be \"wokeism\" in the federal government, a term that conservatives use to describe racial justice and civil rights advocacy. They are part of an effort that he took up in his first term by rolling back policies boosting affirmative action and transgender rights.\n\nIn his Inaugural Address on Monday, Mr. Trump vowed to stop efforts to \"socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that he was being inaugurated on Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday and said he would \"not forget\" that he had gained support among Hispanic and Black voters in the November election.\n\n\"We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nHis actions on Monday are also aimed at bringing back \"biological truth\" to the federal government, according to a Trump official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the orders before they were signed.\n\nMr. Trump ordered federal agencies to recognize a biological, binary definition of sex - male or female and not interchangeable. The government will also eliminate references to gender identity in policy documents, and will order that government-issued documents, including passports and visas, accurately reflect one's biological sex.\n\nOn the first day of his presidency in 2021, Mr. Biden took an essentially opposite position, directing agencies to include sexual orientation and gender identity in any regulations and policies covering workplace discrimination, formalizing protections for L.G.B.T.Q. workers. He extended those directions to schools and students last year.\n\nThe order also prohibits the use of federal funds for any use in \"promoting gender ideology\" through grants or other government programming, as well as the use of public funding for transition-related medical procedures in prisons .\n\nPerhaps the most pointed part of the directive instructs agencies to protect \"intimate single-sex spaces,\" such as prisons and rape shelters, by denying access to transgender women.\n\nThe Trump official said the changes were all aimed at promoting the privacy and safety of women, who the official said had suffered under attempts to cater to transgender workers and students.\n\nElements of Mr. Trump's orders were written to explicitly target education institutions, rolling back actions taken during the Biden administration that extended protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, incoming officials told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe Biden administration had instructed schools that Title IX of the Civil Rights Act , which protects students against discrimination based on sex, afforded the same protections to transgender students against discrimination based on their gender identity.\n\nMr. Trump's executive actions will undo that policy. The order directs his attorney general to release guidance stating that a Supreme Court decision in 2020 that cemented stronger civil rights protections to transgender workers does not apply to schools and their students, echoing a ruling by a federal judge earlier this month.\n\nAt a rally on Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated his intent to minimize the role of the federal government in steering education policy, saying that he instructed his pick for education secretary, Linda McMahon, to return much authority over the nation's schools to state legislatures.\n\n\"If you do a great job, you will put yourself out of a job, because you'll be sending it back to the states,\" he said he had told Ms. McMahon.\n\nBut the executive orders issued on Monday demonstrated the extent to which the Trump administration intends to use the power of the executive branch to compel schools and educators to conform to its vision for social policy.\n\nIn his previous administration, Mr. Trump railed against efforts to teach children about slavery and his conservative allies supported the movement to remove books about race and gender from school libraries. He indicated on Monday that the enforcement power of the Education Department would be critical to bringing change to the nation's schools.\n\n\"We have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them,\" Mr. Trump said during his Inaugural Address. \"All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\"\n\nOn his first day of office, Mr. Biden unveiled a racial equity agenda after vowing during his inauguration speech to defeat \"white supremacy.\"\n\nMr. Biden ordered agencies to take sweeping steps to address inequity in housing, criminal justice, voting rights, health care, education and economic mobility. His administration also created new offices, like one dedicated to civil rights and environmental justice at the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Trump's order specifically targets Mr. Biden's \"environmental justice\" office and personnel for review.\n\nMr. Trump's first act in office was to rescind executive orders issued by Mr. Biden including ones he signed on his first day in office in 2021, \"advancing racial equity and supporting underserved communities\" and \"preventing discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.\"\n\nThe orders were widely seen as cornerstones of Mr. Biden's civil rights legacy, and infused policy efforts across his administration.\n\nBut some of Mr. Biden's efforts, including the Title IX rules and an Agriculture Department program designed to provide disaster relief to minority farmers, ran into legal roadblocks after critics contended that by aiding one group of people, they inherently harmed others.\n\nThe Trump official said that it was fitting that the administration was taking measures on the King holiday to reinstitute equal treatment by eliminating racial \"preferences\" and diversity programming.\n\nThe orders on diversity and gender fit within Mr. Trump's larger goal of bringing back \"American values,\" as laid out in a White House statement on Monday on the president's early priorities.\n\nMr. Trump touched on the theme in his address, again raising a recent promise to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\" and proposing to officially rename North America's tallest peak Mount McKinley after its name had been changed to Denali - its Alaska Native name - under President Barack Obama in 2015.\n\nEileen Sullivan\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other immigrant rights groups sued the Trump administration over its hours-old executive order to stop conferring citizenship to anyone born in the United States. The lawsuit was filed in New Hampshire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nAmong the executive orders Trump signed today was an order restoring the federal death penalty - although President Biden commuted the death sentences of all but three of the prisoners who were on the federal death row. Trump's order also mandates the use of the death penalty in any case where someone is convicted of murdering a law enforcement officer or if an undocumented migrant is convicted of a crime that is eligible for the death penalty.\n\nMatina Stevis-Gridneff\n\nCanada's finance minister responded late Monday to President Trump's statement that he was still planning to impose tariffs of 25 percent on Canadian goods on Feb. 1, even though the new president did not immediately sign a tariff executive order after taking office earlier in the day. \"Our country is absolutely ready to respond to any one of these scenarios,\" Dominic LeBlanc said. \"We still continue to believe that it would be a mistake.\"\n\nLuke Broadwater\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nLeaders in the Democratic Party were swift to condemn President Trump's pardons and commutations of more than 1,500 defendants arrested in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, including the leaders of extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.\n\nMr. Trump's fellow Republicans were noticeably silent.\n\nMr. Trump's decision on Monday delivered broad clemency to nearly all of the 1,600 rioters charged with joining the Capitol attack and commuted the sentences of several others. His decision appeared to cover both people accused of low-level, nonviolent offenses that day and those who committed violence.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi, still one of the most influential figures in the Democratic Party, condemned the pardons as an \"outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol, the Congress and the Constitution.\"\n\n\"It is shameful that the president has decided to make one of his top priorities the abandonment and betrayal of police officers who put their lives on the line to stop an attempt to subvert the peaceful transfer of power,\" Ms. Pelosi said.\n\nFor years, Mr. Trump and his allies have tried to rewrite the narrative around the assault on the Capitol, during which a pro-Trump mob assaulted the police, smashed windows and ransacked offices. Mr. Trump took the final step in lending support to the defendants on Monday by wiping their records clean and portraying them as victims, or even \"hostages\" of what he has repeatedly cast as an unfair justice system.\n\n\"Republicans cannot claim to be the party of law and order while pardoning and commuting the sentences of individuals who brutally assaulted law enforcement officers in service of a violent insurrection,\" said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, adding: \"These defendants were convicted by a jury of their peers for participating in an attack that included direct assaults on law enforcement, vandalism, trespassing, and an attempt to overturn a free and fair election through the use of force.\"\n\nThe assault on the Capitol has created a political dynamic in which Republicans, who often cast themselves as the party of law and order, have taken the side of rioters who attacked the police, said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado.\n\n\"President Trump's pardon of Jan. 6 insurrectionists disrespects the police who fought & died to protect the Capitol,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nAfter the attack on the Capitol, 10 House Republicans voted to impeach Mr. Trump over the assault and seven Republican senators voted to convict him. But one by one, most of them have left Congress as Mr. Trump tightened his grip on the party. Only two of those House members and three senators remain in Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQasim Nauman\n\nHere is a copy of President Trump's proclamation granting clemency to Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nKaroun Demirjian\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order to make border security a priority for the military, a directive that could allow U.S. troops to assume a direct role in immigration enforcement and test longstanding legal limits on deploying armed forces on American soil.\n\nBefore taking office, Mr. Trump promised to redeploy thousands of service members to the U.S. border with Mexico. He pledged to use at least the National Guard, and possibly draw from other branches of the armed forces as well, to achieve his goal of keeping migrants out of the United States and deporting those who entered without authorization.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the southern border, a move that had some precedent in previous administrations.\n\nBut by declaring border security to be a priority for the military as a whole, the president's directive could put his administration on a collision course with laws intended to prevent presidents from using their power as commander in chief to turn the military against U.S. civilians.\n\nHere's what to know about the order, and how it could play out.\n\nMr. Trump's order directs the defense secretary to make border security part of the mission of U.S. Northern Command, sealing U.S. borders and \"repelling forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and tracking, and other criminal activities.\"\n\nThe order gives the defense secretary 30 days to come up with a plan for how to execute the mission. The directive does not specify exactly which branches of the armed forces ought to be deployed to aid in such a mission, leaving those determinations to military leaders.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 forbids the use of armed forces for law enforcement purposes on U.S. soil, unless Congress or the Constitution expressly authorizes it.\n\nWhile the prohibition is seemingly straightforward, some have argued that its limits would not apply if service members were deployed inside the country for military purposes, as opposed to law enforcement ones.\n\nJohn Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general in President George W. Bush's administration who held expansive views of presidential powers, argued for this standard in a 2001 Justice Department memorandum on using the military to fight terrorism domestically.\n\nMr. Trump's declaration that border security is a function of the U.S. military suggests that his administration holds a similar view of the posse comitatus restrictions - and how to sidestep them.\n\nThe law's restrictions also do not apply to the National Guard, so long as the units remain under the command of state governors.\n\nThe main exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the Insurrection Act. The more than 200-year-old law grants the president power to deploy the military domestically when faced with \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" that prevent the execution of federal or state laws.\n\nThat broad power has been invoked about 30 times in U.S. history, including by President Abraham Lincoln when seven Confederate states seceded, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower to enforce the desegregation of schools in Little Rock, Ark. Most recently, President George H.W. Bush used it in 1992 to send troops into Los Angeles at the request of California's governor in an effort to quell race riots that followed the police beating of Rodney King.\n\nMr. Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term to put down racial justice riots that broke out across the country after the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by white police officers. Mark T. Esper, Mr. Trump's defense secretary at the time, strongly opposed the idea, as did Gen. Mark A. Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798 lets the president expel foreign nationals of an enemy nation who are 14 or older. While the law has been invoked only during times of war, presidents can use it for \"any invasion or predatory incursion.\" Mr. Trump has frequently referred to the unlawful flow of migrants and drugs into the United States as an \"invasion.\"\n\nThe president also declared a national emergency on Monday to fund and outfit the military's involvement in his deportation effort, and augment the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to obtain \"complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.\" During his first term, Mr. Trump used an emergency declaration to circumvent Congress and redirect funds to pay for the construction of a border wall.\n\nAnd while U.S. law forbids using service members for law enforcement activities, it doesn't preclude them from performing support functions for law enforcement, including logistics, machinery, intelligence, maintenance and training.\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.\n\nGlenn Thrush\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nThe effort to prosecute the violent mob that ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the leaders of far-right groups who egged them on, represented the biggest and most logistically complex investigation in the history of the Justice Department.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump erased it in an instant on Inauguration Day.\n\nMr. Trump has denounced the Jan. 6 prosecutions as part of a Democratic witch hunt. In reality, they were initiated and overseen by his handpicked U.S. attorney in Washington and the F.B.I. director. They had the support of many Republicans, including Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who said, \"Those who planned and participated in the violence that day should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nMr. Trump's decision to offer full pardons to nearly all of the almost 1,600 rioters and rally organizers implicated in the breach of the Capitol was expected. Still, it sent a shock wave among current and former prosecutors who believe his release of prisoners, whom he calls \"hostages,\" undermines the rule of law.\n\n\"It's a gross misuse of the pardon power, and says that Trump is willing to meddle in a process that helped strengthen the rule of law,\" said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney in Alabama during the Obama administration.\n\nMatthew M. Graves, who stepped down as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia this month after overseeing many of those prosecutions, said he believed the Trump pardons would \"prevent the department from prosecuting the hundreds charged with, or wanted for, assaulting law enforcement officers and reduce the sentences of those convicted of such assaults.\"\n\nMr. Graves, who took over the high-profile post in November 2021, said his office had also brought charges of political violence against left-wing activists such as climate protesters and people who engaged in disruptive demonstrations against the war in Gaza.\n\n\"The question becomes, will their acts of political violence and destruction also be pardoned and if not, why not?\" he asked in an interview on Monday night.\n\nStill, he added, \"there is no undoing these prosecutions, and hundreds have already completed their sentences or completed all or most of their periods of probation.\"\n\nThe shocking attack on the Capitol was the most significant hostile breach of the national legislature since the War of 1812. It threatened to overwhelm the local U.S. attorney's office, which at the time was ill-equipped to process evidence and witnesses for hundreds of cases involving possible perpetrators from around the country.\n\nTo meet the need, the office, then led by Trump appointee Michael R. Sherwin, began to organize an investigation that would soon pull in dozens of prosecutors on loan from around the country. To bring the cases, prosecutors had to devise a new system to collect, store and analyze a monumental volume of cellphone video that became a model for similar platforms now being used to bring war crimes cases.\n\nThe announcement of the pardons came amid questions about the fate of the department at a time when Mr. Trump has vowed to punish anyone, including prosecutors or political opponents, involved in the efforts to hold him accountable for his actions in the aftermath of his loss in the 2020 election.\n\n\"The scales of justice will be rebalanced,\" Mr. Trump said near the start of his Inaugural Address. \"The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamed Aleaziz\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order suspending refugee resettlement in the United States, picking up where he left off in his first term with his efforts to kill a program that offers safe harbor to people around the world facing threats and persecution.\n\nHe has long railed against refugees, claiming that the program floods the country with undesirable people and allows terrorists and other dangerous people into the United States.\n\n\"The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees,\" the executive order reads.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump broke down the U.S. refugee apparatus, decimating a system that had bipartisan support and had been largely untouched for years as he slashed the number of refugees admitted to the country.\n\nHere is what to know about the refugee program, and how Mr. Trump is changing it.\n\nMr. Trump's order suspends refugee resettlement as of next Monday. The order directs top leaders in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to issue a report to him every 90 days thereafter to allow him to assess whether the refugee program \"would be in the interests of the United States,\" according to the order.\n\nForeign nationals seeking to resettle as refugees in the United States face a rigorous and extensive screening process that often lasts for years , which includes security and medical vetting; scrutiny of their families and those with whom they have associated; and interviews with American officials overseas.\n\nUnder the law, U.S. officials can reject anyone who the government \"knows, or has reasonable ground to believe\" will or could commit a terrorist act. But they also have discretion to deny individuals based on mere suspicions.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Mr. Trump put in place even stricter checks for refugees from 11 countries it deemed \"high risk.\"\n\nPresidents have the power to single-handedly determine the number of refugees allowed into the country. Every year, the president, in consultation with Congress, sets a numerical cap for refugee admissions that year.\n\nSince the refugee program began in earnest in 1980, the annual cap has been high, regardless of the party holding the White House. For example, in his final year as president, George W. Bush admitted around 60,000 refugees in 2008 after setting a cap of 80,000.\n\nWhen he first took office in 2017, Mr. Trump initially paused the refugee program. Then, he used the annual cap to sharply cut the number of refugees allowed into the country. By the end of his administration, he proposed capping the number of refugees at 15,000, the lowest number in the more than 40-year history of the program.\n\nThe cuts all but destroyed refugee resettlement in the United States. The network of organizations that support refugees when they first enter the country shrank because they had so many fewer people to serve. The number of government officials assigned to the program also slimmed during those years, to 107 from 170.\n\nIn 2020, the last year of Mr. Trump's first term, just over 11,000 refugees were admitted into the United States - a precipitous drop from the more than 80,000 that were admitted in the year before he took office.\n\nPresident Joseph R. Biden Jr. slowly restored the refugee resettlement operation during his four years in office, hiring more officers and prompting the opening of offices across the country to serve them. Around 150 offices opened as of last year.\n\nBy 2024, the United States had allowed more than 100,000 refugees to enter the country, the highest total in three decades.\n\nThat number will almost assuredly drop in 2025.\n\nTheodore Schleifer\n\nThe general structure of the executive order setting up the Department of Government Efficiency broadly tracks with what we reported in this article . The agency is part of the U.S. Digital Service, and essentially takes it over. The agency is composed also of landing teams at federal agencies, although the Trump executive order says it will now be four-per-agency, not two. And the work will be carried out in part by special government employees, who come in to agencies for just a few months at a time. Questions remain in the executive order, though, including who is the so-called \"administrator\" of the program? Elon Musk himself?\n\nJulian E. Barnes and Devlin Barrett\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order stripping the security clearances of former intelligence officials who in 2020 signed a letter that said the spread of emails from Hunter Biden's laptop had \"the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"\n\nThe order also revoked any security clearances held by John Bolton, who served as a national security adviser in the first Trump administration, but earned the president's ire for publishing a book about his time in office. The executive order said Mr. Bolton wrote a \"reckless\" book that included sensitive information that should not have been published.\n\nThe executive order, first reported by Axios, was the brainchild of John Ratcliffe, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, according to two Trump administration officials.\n\nIt is unclear how many of the 51 people who signed the letter still have active clearances. Former officials said that most of them had allowed their clearances to lapse years ago and that the order was purely performative. But at least some of the former officials have advisory contracts with intelligence agencies or the military. They could lose those contracts without security clearances, according to former officials.\n\nThe signees included prominent intelligence leaders, including Leon Panetta and John Brennan, who served as C.I.A. directors in the Obama administration; Mike Hayden, a C.I.A. director in the Bush administration; and James Clapper, a director of national intelligence in the Obama administration. Mr. Trump previously revoked Mr. Brennan's security clearance in his first administration.\n\nSome had been critics of the first Trump administration and of Mr. Trump's treatment of the intelligence agencies.\n\nThe order accused them of effectively suppressing information the American people needed to know during the election.\n\n\"The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions,\" the order said.\n\nSeveral signees said Mr. Trump was misreading the letter that was carefully crafted to warn of possible manipulation.\n\nTrump has long resented that both social media companies and the intelligence establishment were quick to suggest that the emails from Mr. Biden's laptop were disinformation.\n\nAfter The New York Post wrote about the content of the emails , some social media companies moved to block links to the story. But no evidence has emerged that showed the emails from the laptop had been altered by a foreign government.\n\nWhen tapping Mr. Ratcliffe for the C.I.A., Mr. Trump used social media to praise him for criticizing the letter from the former intelligence officials. Mr. Ratcliffe highlighted his criticism of the letter in his confirmation process, saying that time had validated his assessments when he was director of national intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlie Savage\n\nInvoking emergency power and national security, Trump has issued an order barring asylum for people newly arriving at the Southern border. As a seemingly overlapping move, it also says undocumented migrants are ineligible for asylum if they do not provide federal officials, before entering the United States, \"with sufficient medical information and reliable criminal history and background information\" for vetting.\n\nHamed Aleaziz\n\nOne of President Trump's executive orders signed Monday night directs both the Department of Homeland Security secretary and the attorney general to make sure sanctuary jurisdictions are not given federal funds. The order also directs his leaders to encourage undocumented immigrants to leave the country and directs the Homeland Security Department to increase partnerships with local law enforcement on immigration enforcement.\n\nBrent McDonald and Whitney Shefte\n\nOutside the D.C. Central Detention Facility - where a number of people convicted of crimes on Jan. 6 are being held - we filmed a group of relatives, advocates and former Jan. 6 defendants watching live as President Trump announced that he would grant clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol.\n\nA former Jan. 6 inmate who spent time inside the jail described it as a \"joyous moment.\"\n\ntranscript\n\n\"President Trump has made it clear that by midnight they will release all of the J6ers across the country. Any veteran that was homeless, that was in struggle or a prisoner of war underneath this time in the J6 gulags will be received and not only be celebrated, they will no longer just be tolerated. We are so grateful to President Trump. Promises made, promises kept. Promises made, promises kept.\" \"This is such a joyous moment. But it's also bittersweet because I have brothers in there that have done years of their lives in there - years. Forty-five months for me, and I'm fortunate that I'm out here able to welcome my brothers and my sisters out. It is a very emotional day for me. We can never allow this to happen to another American again.\"\n\nZach Montague\n\nTrump's order related to sex and gender instructs the Justice Department to issue guidance on the legality of single-sex spaces, which will be instrumental to any coming efforts to rescind Biden-era regulations extending protections to transgender students at schools receiving federal funds through Title IX. Chief among those protections was that denying students access to facilities consistent with their gender identity could be considered a form of discrimination under the Civil Rights Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nThe entire crowd outside the D.C. jail just rushed across the street to the doors of the facility after someone apparently announced they saw a detainee who was going to be released through the glass doors, creating a few minutes of chaos. Police on foot scrambled to push them back.\n\nIt's unclear whether anyone is actually going to be released.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nTrump declared earlier today that he would immediately declare Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, but the executive order that the White House just published outlined a longer process of officials making \"a recommendation \" about doing so within the next two weeks.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nThe order also instructs Trump's cabinet to make preparations for him to potentially invoke the Alien Enemies Act. Trump repeatedly promised to use that law to deport suspected members of drug cartels and criminal gangs without due process.\n\nAndrew Duehren\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order challenging an international agreement the Biden administration had negotiated to try and stop large multinational corporations from booking profits in countries with low taxes.\n\nMr. Trump directed his administration to tell the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international body that facilitated the deal, that the agreement had no force in the United States without an act of Congress. In 2021, more than 130 countries signed onto the agreement, which included a new 15 percent minimum tax companies are supposed to pay in every country where they operate.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's order will have little immediate impact on the taxation of multinational companies. The agreement had already run into trouble in the United States - Republicans have long abhorred the international tax deal, and Democrats failed to make the necessary changes to American tax law to bring the United States into compliance with the deal when they controlled Congress.\n\nThat failure has left American companies vulnerable to a key enforcement provision in the agreement. Under the deal, American companies could face higher taxes overseas because the United States did not put into place the 15 percent minimum tax. Some jurisdictions, including the European Union, have moved forward with the minimum tax.\n\nThe possibility of American companies paying higher taxes to European nations, for example, had enraged Republicans, who threatened to charge retaliatory taxes on countries that enforced the rules. Mr. Trump's order directs the Treasury secretary and the United States Trade Representative to examine whether any countries are targeting taxes at American companies and prepare economic measures in response.\n\nMr. Trump's order could help spur a new round of negotiations over international taxation, which has been an irritant among major economies for years. Those talks would take place as America's economic partners are navigating Mr. Trump's threats to dramatically raise tariffs on their exports to the United States.\n\nJack Ewing\n\nPresident Trump's promise to end electric vehicles \"mandates\" using executive action on Monday reflects the view among Republicans that Americans are being coerced into giving up their gasoline cars. But no law or regulation forces anyone to buy an electric car.\n\nMost Biden-era policies were incentives, including $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicle buyers and subsidies and loans that automakers and suppliers could use to build battery factories.\n\nThe Biden administration's goal was for half of all new cars sold by the early 2030s to be electric, meaning that half would still run on fossil fuels.\n\nExisting clean air and fuel economy standards arguably forced automakers to sell more electric cars to comply, but it was up to the automakers to determine what technology to use, and they had until the end of the decade to do so.\n\nGeneral Motors, Hyundai, Volkswagen and other automakers have invested hundreds of billions of dollars to set up assembly lines for electric vehicles and produce batteries domestically. Regardless of what governments do, they have a strong interest in continuing to sell electric cars.\n\nElectric vehicles are also popular with buyers while sales of cars that run on fossil fuels are fading. Hybrid-electric and fully electric vehicles gained 4 percentage points of market share in the United States during the third quarter compared to a year earlier, according to a report this month by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most major automakers. The gains came at the expense of gasoline and diesel vehicles.\n\nCalifornia and some other states have also required that all cars sold by 2035 be electric. But even that rule allows plug-in hybrids to qualify if they are capable of traveling 50 miles on battery power alone.\n\nThe incoming administration is expected to join lawsuits challenging California's right to set its own standards for motor vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement"

His decision appears to cover both people accused of low-level, nonviolent offenses that day and those who committed violence.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump's first executive orders froze most federal hiring, halted new federal rule-making and revoked roughly 80 executive orders issued by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\nWithdrawing from pacts: Among the orders Mr. Trump signed were a pair ordering the country to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and from the World Health Organization .\n\nTikTok ban: Mr. Trump said he had signed an executive order to stall a federal ban of the app. The order told the attorney general not to enforce the law for 75 days to give the Trump administration \"an opportunity to determine the appropriate course forward.\" Read more ›\n\nAdministrative actions: Some of the first administrative actions of the Trump administration took place around the time of Mr. Trump's inaugural speech. Federal officials shut down a government app that allows migrants to schedule appointments to use ports of entry, an option that almost a million immigrants used while it was active.\n\nReturn to the office: Mr. Trump also ordered federal workers to return full time to in-person work. His hiring freeze also specifically targeted the Internal Revenue Service .\n\nBirthright citizenship: Mr. Trump signed an executive order defining birthright citizenship. The president cannot change the Constitution on his own, but he has made it clear he wants to deny birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, to the children of noncitizens. It is all but certain to be challenged in court.\n\nBiden pardons: Mr. Trump expressed displeasure about a last-minute wave of pre-emptive pardons issued by President Biden to protect some of Mr. Trump's adversaries, including Gen. Mark A. Milley. Two of those pardoned, Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, and former Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, thanked Mr. Biden, saying they had been pardoned \"not for breaking the law but for upholding it.\"\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nThe crowd cheered and the music blared.\n\nOn Monday night outside the D.C. jail, some of the family members, fervent supporters and former detainees gathered there swiveled their hips and pumped their fists to a remix of \"Y.M.C.A.,\" in a scene reminiscent of a Trump rally.\n\nThey were there to celebrate President Trump's broad grant of clemency to nearly all 1,600 Jan. 6 defendants, though only a dozen of those pardoned remained in this particular jail on the morning of his inauguration. The nightly vigil, which has lasted for close to two and a half years, has served as the emotional epicenter of support for those who have been prosecuted in connection with the violent attack on the Capitol four years ago.\n\nMicki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt , an Air Force veteran who was fatally shot by the police as rioters tried to storm the building on Jan. 6, 2021, typically kicked off the gathering with a roll call of all the detainees across the country. But not on Monday.\n\n\"We're going to skip that tonight because it's just a variable,\" Ms. Witthoeft said. \"Everybody's getting out.\"\n\nOnly two men, Andrew and Matthew Valentin, brothers who were sentenced just days ago, walked free on Monday, according to Paul Ingrassia, the newly appointed White House liaison to the Justice Department.\n\nBrandon Fellows , 30, who served time at the D.C. jail after being convicted of, among other charges, obstructing the certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s electoral victory, addressed the crowd. Mr. Fellows, who was photographed smoking marijuana in the office of Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, stressed that those who would be leaving prison had a long road ahead.\n\n\"Please keep in mind, the people that are coming out, it's going to be a little rough - it's going to be tough,\" Mr. Fellows said.\n\nMary Pollock, 24, had accompanied her father from Florida in hopes of reuniting with her siblings, Olivia and Jonathan Pollock , who were being held at the jail after they broke the terms of their release two years ago by going on the run.\n\n\"They've kept their spirits up in there,\" she said. \"They've been encouraging the other J6 prisoners.\"\n\nThe scene outside the jail was a departure from the usual vigil held in the back of the facility, under windows that the detainees can peer out of. Men and women who were imprisoned and their families called supporters throughout the night, updating them on the status of their release - but also to proclaim their innocence, as they ordinarily do.\n\nThe crowd had been buoyed by Mr. Trump's promise to issue sweeping pardons on Day 1 of his presidency. They were already anticipating the fulfillment of another vow of his, to pursue his rivals by prosecuting them. Mr. Trump told NBC News in December that the entire Jan. 6 committee \"should go to jail.\"\n\n\"They need to sit in that jail - not the innocent people,\" said Tia Myers, 53, from Fort Thomas, Kentucky, who said she was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and was investigated by the F.B.I. although she did not go inside the building.\n\nMany at the rally sought to rewrite the violent history of the Jan. 6 attack, a narrative that Mr. Trump himself has endorsed at rallies, in news conferences and on television.\n\n\"We saw the cops waving everybody in,\" Ms. Myers said of herself and others who had come to the Capitol that day out of a false conviction that Mr. Trump had won the 2020 election. She quickly added, \"We didn't go in, obviously.\"\n\nScott Tapley, from Goshen, Ind., who brought his two adult daughters to Washington for the inauguration, as he did four years ago to watch Mr. Trump address his supporters on Ellipse on Jan. 6, said the people who had gone inside did so to protest \"peacefully and patriotically,\" only to be treated unfairly by the justice system.\n\n\"I'm so glad to see they're being released,\" Mr. Tapley said. \"This is just an unspeakably joyous, happy day.\"\n\nEven before Mr. Trump formally issued his pardons, Peyton, 20, and Sarah Reffitt, 28, were more reserved in expressing their joy. As the daughters of Guy Reffitt, a member of the Texas Three Percenters militia who was the first person to be charged with a crime for Jan. 6, they had seen their lives upended by the events of that day.\n\nPeyton, tears in her eyes, said she wished her father, who was currently detained in Oklahoma, was home so she could annoy him. But her family had a lot of healing to do, she added - her brother, Jackson, had turned her father in to the authorities and their home was raided 10 days after the attack on the Capitol.\n\nShe said she believed that her father should be held accountable, but she worried that his time in jail and her mother's desire to free him were \"toxic.\"\n\n\"Everything else was taken and this is what they were left with.\" She added, \"They can't just walk away - it's sad.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nIn the first late-night social media post of his second term, President Trump said that his administration was in the process of removing \"over a thousand\" Biden administration appointees who had not already resigned.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nTrump named four such appointees in the post, including Gen. Mark A. Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who had served on the President's National Infrastructure Advisory Council.\n\n\"YOU'RE FIRED!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nNo one else would be released from the D.C. jail today, Sergeant Michael Bowman from Washington's Metropolitan Police Department told the crowd outside in an attempt to get people to go home. Two Jan. 6 detainees were released from the facility earlier, according to a Trump administration official.\n\nHamed Aleaziz\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump moved on Monday to toss out a Biden-era program that allowed migrants fleeing four troubled nations to fly into the United States and remain in the country temporarily, part of a sweeping first-day crackdown on immigration.\n\nThe program, known as humanitarian parole and introduced by the Biden administration in early 2023, allowed migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela to fly into the United States if they had a financial sponsor and passed security checks. Migrants who entered under the program could stay for up to two years, unless they found other ways to stay long term.\n\nAs of late last year, more than 500,000 migrants had entered the country through the initiative.\n\nTrump wants to end several programs that offered new arrivals temporary relief. Millions of others without legal status may also be vulnerable to deportation.\n\nThe program, which Mr. Trump ordered the head of the Department of Homeland Security to end, served as one of two major legal pathways the Biden administration put in place to try to discourage migrants from crossing into the country illegally. The Trump administration already moved earlier Monday to shut down the other program - a government app that allowed migrants to schedule appointments to enter the country at legal ports of entry.\n\n\"These processes - a safe and orderly way to reach the United States - have resulted in a significant reduction in the number of these individuals encountered at our southern border,\" Alejandro N. Mayorkas, the Biden administration's homeland security secretary, said last spring. \"It is a key element of our efforts to address the unprecedented level of migration throughout our hemisphere.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers viewed the program as a way for migrants with no other access to the United States a chance to enter the country for up to two years and obtain work permits.\n\n\"Here's an idea: Don't fly millions of illegals aliens from failed states thousands of miles away into small towns across the American Heartland,\" Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump's immigration policy, said on social media in September.\n\nTexas, along with other Republican-led states, sued to end the program and failed. But the Biden administration had already said in October that it would allow the permission for migrants from the four countries to lapse after their two years ran out, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to find other methods to stay in the country or face deportation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlan Feuer\n\nJust hours after Trump's sweeping Jan. 6 pardons were issued, his new U.S. attorney in Washington, Ed Martin, started dismissing some cases stemming from the Capitol attack, court papers show. Martin has long been an advocate for Jan. 6 defendants and has ties to the Patriot Freedom Project, one of the largest legal fundraising groups for the rioters.\n\nAlan Feuer\n\nOne of the cases that Martin has moved to dismiss is the trial of Jared Wise, a former F.B.I. agent charged with felony civil disorder and assault. Prosecutors say that Wise confronted officers at the Capitol, calling them Nazis and encouraging a mob of Trump supporters to kill them.\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nPaul Ingrassia, the newly appointed White House liaison to the Justice Department, just arrived outside the D.C. jail and spoke to the crowd that had gathered in anticipation that Jan. 6 detainees could be released. Wearing a tuxedo and red scarf, he said that two men from the D.C. facility had already been released: brothers Andrew and Matthew Valentin. According to news reports, they were sentenced just days earlier.\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border on Monday, invoking special presidential powers that allow him to unilaterally unlock federal funding for border wall construction and potentially to deploy the military and National Guard to the border.\n\nMr. Trump took a similar step during his first term as a way to circumvent Congress and access billions of dollars that lawmakers refused to approve to build a wall along the border with Mexico. He once again empowered the military to support the Border Patrol with logistical planning, drone support and help procuring detention space.\n\nBut in a separate order, Mr. Trump appeared to go further by giving the military a specific responsibility over immigration enforcement. During Mr. Trump's first term, the military only supported immigration authorities but did not apprehend migrants. Mr. Trump now directed the Defense Department to come up with a plan in 30 days \"to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the United States by repelling forms of invasion, including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities.\"\n\nWhile details on the exact plans remained unclear, the directive for the military could run afoul of laws that limit the use of regular federal troops for domestic policing purposes.\n\nAs he did in his first term, Mr. Trump relied on the National Emergencies Act, a post-Watergate law that allows the president to declare a national emergency, which enhances his executive powers. The act was intended to enable the federal government to respond quickly to a crisis by creating exemptions to rules that would normally constrain the president.\n\n\"The president has a pretty wide latitude in determining what constitutes a national emergency,\" said Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University. \"If they say it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, well, unless the courts say otherwise, it's a duck.\"\n\nThe law requires that the president inform Congress which statutes he is using as a basis to invoke specific emergency powers. In 2019, Mr. Trump relied on a law that permitted the executive branch to use military construction funds in a declared national emergency.\n\nCongress is limited in what it can do to stop a president from using his emergency powers. Under the National Emergencies Act , the House and the Senate can pass a joint resolution to end the emergency status if they believe that the president is acting irresponsibly or the threat has dissipated. The law says that if one chamber passes such a measure, the other must bring it up in 18 days.\n\nBut Republicans control both chambers of Congress, making it extremely unlikely that Mr. Trump would face pushback from the legislative branch. He could also veto any joint congressional resolution terminating the national emergency.\n\nJudges temporarily blocked, and subsequently restarted, Mr. Trump's use of military funds for border wall construction on multiple occasions before President Joseph R. Biden Jr. came into office and terminated Mr. Trump's emergency declaration.\n\nThe border has also been particularly calm in recent days , especially when compared with the numbers seen a year ago, a development that could undermine Mr. Trump's assertion that an emergency exists. But that might not matter. The Justice Department is likely to argue in any litigation that the courts should defer to the president's determination.\n\nEric Schmitt contributed reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nPresident Trump is currently speaking at the Commander-in-Chief inaugural ball celebrating the U.S. armed forces after participating in a traditional first dance at the event.\n\n\"As I said in my Inaugural Address, we will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars we end and perhaps most importantly the wars we never get into,\" Trump said at the black-tie event.\n\nShawn McCreesh\n\nAfter making two speeches at the Capitol, holding a rally, and giving a freewheeling press conference held from behind the Resolute Desk while signing an astonishing number of executive orders, President Trump is now waving a military sword around in the air while dancing to Village People. There's still an hour to go left in this day.\n\nErica L. Green and Zach Montague\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday ordered his administration to gut policies instituted under the Biden administration to prevent sex discrimination and protect transgender Americans, and dismantle federal programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nMr. Trump's actions, part of a blitz of orders that he signed on his first day in office, assert that the government will now defend women against \"gender ideology extremism\" by reversing \"efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex.\" They also call for ending D.E.I. programs and the \"termination of all discriminatory programs\" in the government, including in federal employment practices.\n\nThe executive orders included a mix of administrative measures, such as changing government forms to include only two genders, as well as assertions dismissing the validity of gender identity entirely. A gender identity other than the one assigned at birth, an order said, \"reflects a fully internal and subjective sense of self\" and \"does not provide a meaningful basis for identification.\"\n\nThe actions also effectively shut down an array of programs and practices aimed at reversing decades of systemic inequities and discriminatory practices that have disproportionately affected Black people and other underserved communities.\n\nUnder the orders, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Performance and Personnel Management will coordinate on changing hiring practices, ending equity-focused programs and grants and terminating \"chief diversity officer\" positions designated during the Biden administration.\n\nThe orders deliver on Mr. Trump's promise to eradicate what his allies consider to be \"wokeism\" in the federal government, a term that conservatives use to describe racial justice and civil rights advocacy. They are part of an effort that he took up in his first term by rolling back policies boosting affirmative action and transgender rights.\n\nIn his Inaugural Address on Monday, Mr. Trump vowed to stop efforts to \"socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that he was being inaugurated on Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday and said he would \"not forget\" that he had gained support among Hispanic and Black voters in the November election.\n\n\"We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nHis actions on Monday are also aimed at bringing back \"biological truth\" to the federal government, according to a Trump official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the orders before they were signed.\n\nMr. Trump ordered federal agencies to recognize a biological, binary definition of sex - male or female and not interchangeable. The government will also eliminate references to gender identity in policy documents, and will order that government-issued documents, including passports and visas, accurately reflect one's biological sex.\n\nOn the first day of his presidency in 2021, Mr. Biden took an essentially opposite position, directing agencies to include sexual orientation and gender identity in any regulations and policies covering workplace discrimination, formalizing protections for L.G.B.T.Q. workers. He extended those directions to schools and students last year.\n\nThe order also prohibits the use of federal funds for any use in \"promoting gender ideology\" through grants or other government programming, as well as the use of public funding for transition-related medical procedures in prisons .\n\nPerhaps the most pointed part of the directive instructs agencies to protect \"intimate single-sex spaces,\" such as prisons and rape shelters, by denying access to transgender women.\n\nThe Trump official said the changes were all aimed at promoting the privacy and safety of women, who the official said had suffered under attempts to cater to transgender workers and students.\n\nElements of Mr. Trump's orders were written to explicitly target education institutions, rolling back actions taken during the Biden administration that extended protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, incoming officials told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe Biden administration had instructed schools that Title IX of the Civil Rights Act , which protects students against discrimination based on sex, afforded the same protections to transgender students against discrimination based on their gender identity.\n\nMr. Trump's executive actions will undo that policy. The order directs his attorney general to release guidance stating that a Supreme Court decision in 2020 that cemented stronger civil rights protections to transgender workers does not apply to schools and their students, echoing a ruling by a federal judge earlier this month.\n\nAt a rally on Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated his intent to minimize the role of the federal government in steering education policy, saying that he instructed his pick for education secretary, Linda McMahon, to return much authority over the nation's schools to state legislatures.\n\n\"If you do a great job, you will put yourself out of a job, because you'll be sending it back to the states,\" he said he had told Ms. McMahon.\n\nBut the executive orders issued on Monday demonstrated the extent to which the Trump administration intends to use the power of the executive branch to compel schools and educators to conform to its vision for social policy.\n\nIn his previous administration, Mr. Trump railed against efforts to teach children about slavery and his conservative allies supported the movement to remove books about race and gender from school libraries. He indicated on Monday that the enforcement power of the Education Department would be critical to bringing change to the nation's schools.\n\n\"We have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them,\" Mr. Trump said during his Inaugural Address. \"All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\"\n\nOn his first day of office, Mr. Biden unveiled a racial equity agenda after vowing during his inauguration speech to defeat \"white supremacy.\"\n\nMr. Biden ordered agencies to take sweeping steps to address inequity in housing, criminal justice, voting rights, health care, education and economic mobility. His administration also created new offices, like one dedicated to civil rights and environmental justice at the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Trump's order specifically targets Mr. Biden's \"environmental justice\" office and personnel for review.\n\nMr. Trump's first act in office was to rescind executive orders issued by Mr. Biden including ones he signed on his first day in office in 2021, \"advancing racial equity and supporting underserved communities\" and \"preventing discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.\"\n\nThe orders were widely seen as cornerstones of Mr. Biden's civil rights legacy, and infused policy efforts across his administration.\n\nBut some of Mr. Biden's efforts, including the Title IX rules and an Agriculture Department program designed to provide disaster relief to minority farmers, ran into legal roadblocks after critics contended that by aiding one group of people, they inherently harmed others.\n\nThe Trump official said that it was fitting that the administration was taking measures on the King holiday to reinstitute equal treatment by eliminating racial \"preferences\" and diversity programming.\n\nThe orders on diversity and gender fit within Mr. Trump's larger goal of bringing back \"American values,\" as laid out in a White House statement on Monday on the president's early priorities.\n\nMr. Trump touched on the theme in his address, again raising a recent promise to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\" and proposing to officially rename North America's tallest peak Mount McKinley after its name had been changed to Denali - its Alaska Native name - under President Barack Obama in 2015.\n\nEileen Sullivan\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and other immigrant rights groups sued the Trump administration over its hours-old executive order to stop conferring citizenship to anyone born in the United States. The lawsuit was filed in New Hampshire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Cameron\n\nAmong the executive orders Trump signed today was an order restoring the federal death penalty - although President Biden commuted the death sentences of all but three of the prisoners who were on the federal death row. Trump's order also mandates the use of the death penalty in any case where someone is convicted of murdering a law enforcement officer or if an undocumented migrant is convicted of a crime that is eligible for the death penalty.\n\nMatina Stevis-Gridneff\n\nCanada's finance minister responded late Monday to President Trump's statement that he was still planning to impose tariffs of 25 percent on Canadian goods on Feb. 1, even though the new president did not immediately sign a tariff executive order after taking office earlier in the day. \"Our country is absolutely ready to respond to any one of these scenarios,\" Dominic LeBlanc said. \"We still continue to believe that it would be a mistake.\"\n\nLuke Broadwater\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nLeaders in the Democratic Party were swift to condemn President Trump's pardons and commutations of more than 1,500 defendants arrested in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, including the leaders of extremist groups like the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.\n\nMr. Trump's fellow Republicans were noticeably silent.\n\nMr. Trump's decision on Monday delivered broad clemency to nearly all of the 1,600 rioters charged with joining the Capitol attack and commuted the sentences of several others. His decision appeared to cover both people accused of low-level, nonviolent offenses that day and those who committed violence.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi, still one of the most influential figures in the Democratic Party, condemned the pardons as an \"outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol, the Congress and the Constitution.\"\n\n\"It is shameful that the president has decided to make one of his top priorities the abandonment and betrayal of police officers who put their lives on the line to stop an attempt to subvert the peaceful transfer of power,\" Ms. Pelosi said.\n\nFor years, Mr. Trump and his allies have tried to rewrite the narrative around the assault on the Capitol, during which a pro-Trump mob assaulted the police, smashed windows and ransacked offices. Mr. Trump took the final step in lending support to the defendants on Monday by wiping their records clean and portraying them as victims, or even \"hostages\" of what he has repeatedly cast as an unfair justice system.\n\n\"Republicans cannot claim to be the party of law and order while pardoning and commuting the sentences of individuals who brutally assaulted law enforcement officers in service of a violent insurrection,\" said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, adding: \"These defendants were convicted by a jury of their peers for participating in an attack that included direct assaults on law enforcement, vandalism, trespassing, and an attempt to overturn a free and fair election through the use of force.\"\n\nThe assault on the Capitol has created a political dynamic in which Republicans, who often cast themselves as the party of law and order, have taken the side of rioters who attacked the police, said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado.\n\n\"President Trump's pardon of Jan. 6 insurrectionists disrespects the police who fought & died to protect the Capitol,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nAfter the attack on the Capitol, 10 House Republicans voted to impeach Mr. Trump over the assault and seven Republican senators voted to convict him. But one by one, most of them have left Congress as Mr. Trump tightened his grip on the party. Only two of those House members and three senators remain in Congress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQasim Nauman\n\nHere is a copy of President Trump's proclamation granting clemency to Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nKaroun Demirjian\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order to make border security a priority for the military, a directive that could allow U.S. troops to assume a direct role in immigration enforcement and test longstanding legal limits on deploying armed forces on American soil.\n\nBefore taking office, Mr. Trump promised to redeploy thousands of service members to the U.S. border with Mexico. He pledged to use at least the National Guard, and possibly draw from other branches of the armed forces as well, to achieve his goal of keeping migrants out of the United States and deporting those who entered without authorization.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the southern border, a move that had some precedent in previous administrations.\n\nBut by declaring border security to be a priority for the military as a whole, the president's directive could put his administration on a collision course with laws intended to prevent presidents from using their power as commander in chief to turn the military against U.S. civilians.\n\nHere's what to know about the order, and how it could play out.\n\nMr. Trump's order directs the defense secretary to make border security part of the mission of U.S. Northern Command, sealing U.S. borders and \"repelling forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and tracking, and other criminal activities.\"\n\nThe order gives the defense secretary 30 days to come up with a plan for how to execute the mission. The directive does not specify exactly which branches of the armed forces ought to be deployed to aid in such a mission, leaving those determinations to military leaders.\n\nThe Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 forbids the use of armed forces for law enforcement purposes on U.S. soil, unless Congress or the Constitution expressly authorizes it.\n\nWhile the prohibition is seemingly straightforward, some have argued that its limits would not apply if service members were deployed inside the country for military purposes, as opposed to law enforcement ones.\n\nJohn Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general in President George W. Bush's administration who held expansive views of presidential powers, argued for this standard in a 2001 Justice Department memorandum on using the military to fight terrorism domestically.\n\nMr. Trump's declaration that border security is a function of the U.S. military suggests that his administration holds a similar view of the posse comitatus restrictions - and how to sidestep them.\n\nThe law's restrictions also do not apply to the National Guard, so long as the units remain under the command of state governors.\n\nThe main exception to the Posse Comitatus Act is the Insurrection Act. The more than 200-year-old law grants the president power to deploy the military domestically when faced with \"unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion\" that prevent the execution of federal or state laws.\n\nThat broad power has been invoked about 30 times in U.S. history, including by President Abraham Lincoln when seven Confederate states seceded, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower to enforce the desegregation of schools in Little Rock, Ark. Most recently, President George H.W. Bush used it in 1992 to send troops into Los Angeles at the request of California's governor in an effort to quell race riots that followed the police beating of Rodney King.\n\nMr. Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act during his first term to put down racial justice riots that broke out across the country after the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by white police officers. Mark T. Esper, Mr. Trump's defense secretary at the time, strongly opposed the idea, as did Gen. Mark A. Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798 lets the president expel foreign nationals of an enemy nation who are 14 or older. While the law has been invoked only during times of war, presidents can use it for \"any invasion or predatory incursion.\" Mr. Trump has frequently referred to the unlawful flow of migrants and drugs into the United States as an \"invasion.\"\n\nThe president also declared a national emergency on Monday to fund and outfit the military's involvement in his deportation effort, and augment the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to obtain \"complete operational control of the southern border of the United States.\" During his first term, Mr. Trump used an emergency declaration to circumvent Congress and redirect funds to pay for the construction of a border wall.\n\nAnd while U.S. law forbids using service members for law enforcement activities, it doesn't preclude them from performing support functions for law enforcement, including logistics, machinery, intelligence, maintenance and training.\n\nZolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.\n\nGlenn Thrush\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nThe effort to prosecute the violent mob that ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the leaders of far-right groups who egged them on, represented the biggest and most logistically complex investigation in the history of the Justice Department.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump erased it in an instant on Inauguration Day.\n\nMr. Trump has denounced the Jan. 6 prosecutions as part of a Democratic witch hunt. In reality, they were initiated and overseen by his handpicked U.S. attorney in Washington and the F.B.I. director. They had the support of many Republicans, including Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who said, \"Those who planned and participated in the violence that day should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\"\n\nMr. Trump's decision to offer full pardons to nearly all of the almost 1,600 rioters and rally organizers implicated in the breach of the Capitol was expected. Still, it sent a shock wave among current and former prosecutors who believe his release of prisoners, whom he calls \"hostages,\" undermines the rule of law.\n\n\"It's a gross misuse of the pardon power, and says that Trump is willing to meddle in a process that helped strengthen the rule of law,\" said Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney in Alabama during the Obama administration.\n\nMatthew M. Graves, who stepped down as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia this month after overseeing many of those prosecutions, said he believed the Trump pardons would \"prevent the department from prosecuting the hundreds charged with, or wanted for, assaulting law enforcement officers and reduce the sentences of those convicted of such assaults.\"\n\nMr. Graves, who took over the high-profile post in November 2021, said his office had also brought charges of political violence against left-wing activists such as climate protesters and people who engaged in disruptive demonstrations against the war in Gaza.\n\n\"The question becomes, will their acts of political violence and destruction also be pardoned and if not, why not?\" he asked in an interview on Monday night.\n\nStill, he added, \"there is no undoing these prosecutions, and hundreds have already completed their sentences or completed all or most of their periods of probation.\"\n\nThe shocking attack on the Capitol was the most significant hostile breach of the national legislature since the War of 1812. It threatened to overwhelm the local U.S. attorney's office, which at the time was ill-equipped to process evidence and witnesses for hundreds of cases involving possible perpetrators from around the country.\n\nTo meet the need, the office, then led by Trump appointee Michael R. Sherwin, began to organize an investigation that would soon pull in dozens of prosecutors on loan from around the country. To bring the cases, prosecutors had to devise a new system to collect, store and analyze a monumental volume of cellphone video that became a model for similar platforms now being used to bring war crimes cases.\n\nThe announcement of the pardons came amid questions about the fate of the department at a time when Mr. Trump has vowed to punish anyone, including prosecutors or political opponents, involved in the efforts to hold him accountable for his actions in the aftermath of his loss in the 2020 election.\n\n\"The scales of justice will be rebalanced,\" Mr. Trump said near the start of his Inaugural Address. \"The vicious, violent and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamed Aleaziz\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order suspending refugee resettlement in the United States, picking up where he left off in his first term with his efforts to kill a program that offers safe harbor to people around the world facing threats and persecution.\n\nHe has long railed against refugees, claiming that the program floods the country with undesirable people and allows terrorists and other dangerous people into the United States.\n\n\"The United States lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security, and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees,\" the executive order reads.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump broke down the U.S. refugee apparatus, decimating a system that had bipartisan support and had been largely untouched for years as he slashed the number of refugees admitted to the country.\n\nHere is what to know about the refugee program, and how Mr. Trump is changing it.\n\nMr. Trump's order suspends refugee resettlement as of next Monday. The order directs top leaders in the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to issue a report to him every 90 days thereafter to allow him to assess whether the refugee program \"would be in the interests of the United States,\" according to the order.\n\nForeign nationals seeking to resettle as refugees in the United States face a rigorous and extensive screening process that often lasts for years , which includes security and medical vetting; scrutiny of their families and those with whom they have associated; and interviews with American officials overseas.\n\nUnder the law, U.S. officials can reject anyone who the government \"knows, or has reasonable ground to believe\" will or could commit a terrorist act. But they also have discretion to deny individuals based on mere suspicions.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Mr. Trump put in place even stricter checks for refugees from 11 countries it deemed \"high risk.\"\n\nPresidents have the power to single-handedly determine the number of refugees allowed into the country. Every year, the president, in consultation with Congress, sets a numerical cap for refugee admissions that year.\n\nSince the refugee program began in earnest in 1980, the annual cap has been high, regardless of the party holding the White House. For example, in his final year as president, George W. Bush admitted around 60,000 refugees in 2008 after setting a cap of 80,000.\n\nWhen he first took office in 2017, Mr. Trump initially paused the refugee program. Then, he used the annual cap to sharply cut the number of refugees allowed into the country. By the end of his administration, he proposed capping the number of refugees at 15,000, the lowest number in the more than 40-year history of the program.\n\nThe cuts all but destroyed refugee resettlement in the United States. The network of organizations that support refugees when they first enter the country shrank because they had so many fewer people to serve. The number of government officials assigned to the program also slimmed during those years, to 107 from 170.\n\nIn 2020, the last year of Mr. Trump's first term, just over 11,000 refugees were admitted into the United States - a precipitous drop from the more than 80,000 that were admitted in the year before he took office.\n\nPresident Joseph R. Biden Jr. slowly restored the refugee resettlement operation during his four years in office, hiring more officers and prompting the opening of offices across the country to serve them. Around 150 offices opened as of last year.\n\nBy 2024, the United States had allowed more than 100,000 refugees to enter the country, the highest total in three decades.\n\nThat number will almost assuredly drop in 2025.\n\nTheodore Schleifer\n\nThe general structure of the executive order setting up the Department of Government Efficiency broadly tracks with what we reported in this article . The agency is part of the U.S. Digital Service, and essentially takes it over. The agency is composed also of landing teams at federal agencies, although the Trump executive order says it will now be four-per-agency, not two. And the work will be carried out in part by special government employees, who come in to agencies for just a few months at a time. Questions remain in the executive order, though, including who is the so-called \"administrator\" of the program? Elon Musk himself?\n\nJulian E. Barnes and Devlin Barrett\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump on Monday signed an executive order stripping the security clearances of former intelligence officials who in 2020 signed a letter that said the spread of emails from Hunter Biden's laptop had \"the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"\n\nThe order also revoked any security clearances held by John Bolton, who served as a national security adviser in the first Trump administration, but earned the president's ire for publishing a book about his time in office. The executive order said Mr. Bolton wrote a \"reckless\" book that included sensitive information that should not have been published.\n\nThe executive order, first reported by Axios, was the brainchild of John Ratcliffe, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, according to two Trump administration officials.\n\nIt is unclear how many of the 51 people who signed the letter still have active clearances. Former officials said that most of them had allowed their clearances to lapse years ago and that the order was purely performative. But at least some of the former officials have advisory contracts with intelligence agencies or the military. They could lose those contracts without security clearances, according to former officials.\n\nThe signees included prominent intelligence leaders, including Leon Panetta and John Brennan, who served as C.I.A. directors in the Obama administration; Mike Hayden, a C.I.A. director in the Bush administration; and James Clapper, a director of national intelligence in the Obama administration. Mr. Trump previously revoked Mr. Brennan's security clearance in his first administration.\n\nSome had been critics of the first Trump administration and of Mr. Trump's treatment of the intelligence agencies.\n\nThe order accused them of effectively suppressing information the American people needed to know during the election.\n\n\"The signatories willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions,\" the order said.\n\nSeveral signees said Mr. Trump was misreading the letter that was carefully crafted to warn of possible manipulation.\n\nTrump has long resented that both social media companies and the intelligence establishment were quick to suggest that the emails from Mr. Biden's laptop were disinformation.\n\nAfter The New York Post wrote about the content of the emails , some social media companies moved to block links to the story. But no evidence has emerged that showed the emails from the laptop had been altered by a foreign government.\n\nWhen tapping Mr. Ratcliffe for the C.I.A., Mr. Trump used social media to praise him for criticizing the letter from the former intelligence officials. Mr. Ratcliffe highlighted his criticism of the letter in his confirmation process, saying that time had validated his assessments when he was director of national intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlie Savage\n\nInvoking emergency power and national security, Trump has issued an order barring asylum for people newly arriving at the Southern border. As a seemingly overlapping move, it also says undocumented migrants are ineligible for asylum if they do not provide federal officials, before entering the United States, \"with sufficient medical information and reliable criminal history and background information\" for vetting.\n\nHamed Aleaziz\n\nOne of President Trump's executive orders signed Monday night directs both the Department of Homeland Security secretary and the attorney general to make sure sanctuary jurisdictions are not given federal funds. The order also directs his leaders to encourage undocumented immigrants to leave the country and directs the Homeland Security Department to increase partnerships with local law enforcement on immigration enforcement.\n\nBrent McDonald and Whitney Shefte\n\nOutside the D.C. Central Detention Facility - where a number of people convicted of crimes on Jan. 6 are being held - we filmed a group of relatives, advocates and former Jan. 6 defendants watching live as President Trump announced that he would grant clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol.\n\nA former Jan. 6 inmate who spent time inside the jail described it as a \"joyous moment.\"\n\ntranscript\n\n\"President Trump has made it clear that by midnight they will release all of the J6ers across the country. Any veteran that was homeless, that was in struggle or a prisoner of war underneath this time in the J6 gulags will be received and not only be celebrated, they will no longer just be tolerated. We are so grateful to President Trump. Promises made, promises kept. Promises made, promises kept.\" \"This is such a joyous moment. But it's also bittersweet because I have brothers in there that have done years of their lives in there - years. Forty-five months for me, and I'm fortunate that I'm out here able to welcome my brothers and my sisters out. It is a very emotional day for me. We can never allow this to happen to another American again.\"\n\nZach Montague\n\nTrump's order related to sex and gender instructs the Justice Department to issue guidance on the legality of single-sex spaces, which will be instrumental to any coming efforts to rescind Biden-era regulations extending protections to transgender students at schools receiving federal funds through Title IX. Chief among those protections was that denying students access to facilities consistent with their gender identity could be considered a form of discrimination under the Civil Rights Act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAishvarya Kavi\n\nThe entire crowd outside the D.C. jail just rushed across the street to the doors of the facility after someone apparently announced they saw a detainee who was going to be released through the glass doors, creating a few minutes of chaos. Police on foot scrambled to push them back.\n\nIt's unclear whether anyone is actually going to be released.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nTrump declared earlier today that he would immediately declare Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, but the executive order that the White House just published outlined a longer process of officials making \"a recommendation \" about doing so within the next two weeks.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nThe order also instructs Trump's cabinet to make preparations for him to potentially invoke the Alien Enemies Act. Trump repeatedly promised to use that law to deport suspected members of drug cartels and criminal gangs without due process.\n\nAndrew Duehren\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order challenging an international agreement the Biden administration had negotiated to try and stop large multinational corporations from booking profits in countries with low taxes.\n\nMr. Trump directed his administration to tell the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international body that facilitated the deal, that the agreement had no force in the United States without an act of Congress. In 2021, more than 130 countries signed onto the agreement, which included a new 15 percent minimum tax companies are supposed to pay in every country where they operate.\n\nBut Mr. Trump's order will have little immediate impact on the taxation of multinational companies. The agreement had already run into trouble in the United States - Republicans have long abhorred the international tax deal, and Democrats failed to make the necessary changes to American tax law to bring the United States into compliance with the deal when they controlled Congress.\n\nThat failure has left American companies vulnerable to a key enforcement provision in the agreement. Under the deal, American companies could face higher taxes overseas because the United States did not put into place the 15 percent minimum tax. Some jurisdictions, including the European Union, have moved forward with the minimum tax.\n\nThe possibility of American companies paying higher taxes to European nations, for example, had enraged Republicans, who threatened to charge retaliatory taxes on countries that enforced the rules. Mr. Trump's order directs the Treasury secretary and the United States Trade Representative to examine whether any countries are targeting taxes at American companies and prepare economic measures in response.\n\nMr. Trump's order could help spur a new round of negotiations over international taxation, which has been an irritant among major economies for years. Those talks would take place as America's economic partners are navigating Mr. Trump's threats to dramatically raise tariffs on their exports to the United States.\n\nJack Ewing\n\nPresident Trump's promise to end electric vehicles \"mandates\" using executive action on Monday reflects the view among Republicans that Americans are being coerced into giving up their gasoline cars. But no law or regulation forces anyone to buy an electric car.\n\nMost Biden-era policies were incentives, including $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicle buyers and subsidies and loans that automakers and suppliers could use to build battery factories.\n\nThe Biden administration's goal was for half of all new cars sold by the early 2030s to be electric, meaning that half would still run on fossil fuels.\n\nExisting clean air and fuel economy standards arguably forced automakers to sell more electric cars to comply, but it was up to the automakers to determine what technology to use, and they had until the end of the decade to do so.\n\nGeneral Motors, Hyundai, Volkswagen and other automakers have invested hundreds of billions of dollars to set up assembly lines for electric vehicles and produce batteries domestically. Regardless of what governments do, they have a strong interest in continuing to sell electric cars.\n\nElectric vehicles are also popular with buyers while sales of cars that run on fossil fuels are fading. Hybrid-electric and fully electric vehicles gained 4 percentage points of market share in the United States during the third quarter compared to a year earlier, according to a report this month by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most major automakers. The gains came at the expense of gasoline and diesel vehicles.\n\nCalifornia and some other states have also required that all cars sold by 2035 be electric. But even that rule allows plug-in hybrids to qualify if they are capable of traveling 50 miles on battery power alone.\n\nThe incoming administration is expected to join lawsuits challenging California's right to set its own standards for motor vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "A Capitol Rioter Has Become a Right-Wing Media Darling. She Just Got Arrested.\n\nIn the three years since the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, more than 1,300 participants have been charged with crimes. But outside a few of the flashiest and most memorable characters from the day, most individual prosecutions have passed with little public note. Last Monday, however, the news of one arrest was met with more outrage: that of Isabella Maria DeLuca, a 24-year-old conservative influencer.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, on Jan. 6, 2021, DeLuca-who was arrested on Friday-entered a set of conference rooms inside the Capitol building by climbing through a broken window. She then climbed back out and was one of several people who passed a table from a Senate terrace room to rioters outside the building. The FBI testified that rioters later used the table to attack Capitol Police.\n\nAround 3 p.m. that day, she tweeted, \"Fight back or let politicians steal an election? Fight back!\" Later, according to the arrest warrant, she would express her hopes that Trump would enact martial law.\n\nAfter the news of her charges broke, DeLuca posted that she was \"facing the unwarranted targeting and persecution by the DOJ and FBI at the direction of the Biden Administration, like most J6ers.\" She added, \"This experience for me, has only served to shed light on the challenges conservative Americans, Christians, and Trump supporters face daily.\"\n\nNot long afterward, her defenders settled on a particular argument. \"Just so everyone knows the rules,\" one person posted, \"touching a table near a Capitol window is a criminal offense because someone may later use the table in a crime.\" Another: \"So now you can be arrested and charged for 'TOUCHING A TABLE.' \" And another: \"I guess 'touching a table' is a threat to democracy. This is asinine.\"\n\nHer crime was not, of course, \"touching a table.\" DeLuca was charged with theft of government property, disorderly conduct, and entering a restricted area. Video from that day shows her helping to remove the table from inside the Capitol.\n\nBut that didn't stop people from arguing that she was a victim of political persecution. Some on social media claimed that the Biden administration had gone after DeLuca specifically to send a message because of her social media presence; she has more than 343,000 followers on X. (DeLuca also, in her social media, highlighted that she was being attacked while \"illegals\" were coming into the country and claimed that more-serious criminals were escaping justice. \"I wish the seven agents that came to arrest me were instead searching for missing children and arresting child sex traffickers,\" she posted. \"Apparently, that's asking for too much.\")\n\nThe narrative took hold. Elon Musk, responding to a post from the right-wing influencer Ian Miles Cheong, replied on X that \"the Jan 6 prosecutions have gone too far.\" DeLuca's GiveSendGo (a crowdfunding platform favored by conservatives) has now raised $19,000 for her legal defense, boosted by calls for conservatives to defend their own.\n\nThis popular response was likely to some degree because DeLuca is young, blond, and conventionally attractive. DeLuca is a traditional influencer in this regard: She knows to boost her conservative political opinions with selfies and expertly posed photos directed at what appears to be her target audience of young male conservatives. Photos of her, sometimes in swimsuits, pop up in subreddits dedicated to hot conservative women. Her most popular post on X, by far, is a video of her baking: Captioned \"brown butter caramel cake is the messiest thing I've made thus far,\" it has 13 million views, in large part because of the misogynistic backlash to the tight T-shirt she's wearing in the video. The video spurred a micro news cycle on the right after some influential viewers accused it of amounting to pornographic content. She quickly hit more mainstream media when she shared screen grabs of former San Francisco Giants player Aubrey Huff flirting with her-following his remarks that, for women like her, \"sexuality is all they bring to the table.\"\n\nBut DeLuca is a savvy social media user, one who operates as a specific kind of conservative influencer: a brash, outspoken, attractive woman professing traditional ideas about gender norms, with her sexuality often framed as being reserved for a theoretical \"future husband.\" (Some misogynists who believe that these influencers are being cynically opportunistic have termed this archetype the \"tradthot.\")\n\n\"Dear future husband,\" she posted in July , to 2.5 million views, \"instead of spending my weekends out at bars and parties, I stay home and learn new recipes I can cook for you one day. You can thank me in kisses later. Love, Your future wife.\"\n\nShe mixed that in with more explicitly political posts (\"I can't wait until Trump begins the biggest mass deportation in United States history\"); sponsored posts about the film Cabrini from the Sound of Freedom 's Angel Studios; and exhortations for women to \"have lots of children,\" grow their own food, shoot guns, eat meat, and homeschool their children.\n\nAfter her arrest, DeLuca reshared a post on X confirming that she enjoys her particular place in the conservative influencer ecosystem: \"She's hot, has heavy D's, can bake and she's now being politically persecuted by Biden's regime. Wifey material right there.\"\n\nBut to reduce DeLuca to her looks is to ignore the amount of strategizing she has put into becoming a big name. DeLuca has been posting political and conservative Christian content since her teenage years. But her breakout moment came on Oct. 17, 2020, during a counterprotest against the Women's March in Washington.\n\nAt the end of that day, she posted photos of herself wearing a neck brace, with bruising on her face and an apparently bloodied mouth. DeLuca wrote on Twitter that she \"just got punched in the face and choked by two women because I was holding a Trump flag here at the Supreme Court.\"\n\nBut video from the time shows DeLuca shoving a woman with both hands, retrieving a flag from the ground, and walking aggressively toward the woman she had shoved. There's no video of what happened before DeLuca shoved the woman, so we don't know what instigated the fight; it's possible the woman had forcefully taken the flag out of DeLuca's hands. What we do know is that DeLuca appeared to escalate the fight, at the least, and that she lied when she claimed on Twitter that she \"put my hand up to retrieve [the flag] from the ground so I didn't get kicked while I was down on the ground.\"\n\nRegardless, the experience launched DeLuca into minor right-wing stardom. She was written up as the victim of rabid left-wing violence by publications like the Blaze . Fox News reported DeLuca's claims that Facebook had removed her account of the alleged assault.\n\nAnd this appears not to have been the first time she had gotten attention for being the alleged subject of an attack. In September 2019, right-wing provocateur Charlie Kirk posted a photo of himself with DeLuca. \"This is Isabella,\" he wrote on Twitter . \"She was beaten up and dragged through a parking lot for wearing a Trump shirt. The media didn't report or cover this hate crime.\"\n\nShe's been slowly growing a presence in right-wing media in the years since her Women's March experience, appearing on Newsmax and podcasts . And as the blog Angry White Men noted, she has appeared twice on a Rumble show hosted by white nationalist Stew Peters. In those appearances, she blamed feminism and other elements of the left for the \"declining white majority\"-a view that fits with a number of her posts on social media, including one about white pride .\n\nMeanwhile, DeLuca has taken more conventional pathways into Republican Party politics. In his 2019 post, Kirk noted that DeLuca was president of a Talking Point USA chapter.\n\nAt the time of the Women's March, she was outreach director for Republicans for National Renewal, a populist, pro-Trump advocacy group. (The group called Black Lives Matter a \"terrorist organization\" at the time of DeLuca's alleged assault, despite there being no evidence anyone involved in the incident represented BLM; one woman present wore a shirt that featured Black icons.) DeLuca would go on to volunteer as a \"Turning Point ambassador\" for the Tempe, Arizona-based TPUSA branch and in 2023, to speak at a Second Amendment conference in Arlington, Virginia. (She also worked as an unpaid social media associate for a foreign policy group called the Gold Institute for International Strategy. Last Monday, the organization cut ties with her.)\n\nDeLuca gained more legitimate political credentials through her work with actual lawmakers. Just three months after the Capitol riot, she began a stint as an intern at the office of then-Rep. Lee Zeldin, a major Trump ally who in 2022 became the GOP's nominee for New York governor. This would make her the first known Jan. 6 insurrectionist to take a job in Congress. Then, in 2022, she interned for Rep. Paul Gosar , another election denier. According to Politico , both Gosar's and Zeldin's offices said they had no knowledge of DeLuca's Jan. 6 activities; Zeldin's office said she had only \"volunteered unpaid to help a staff member in the district.\"\n\nSo, DeLuca is no mere social media poster: She's a woman who learned the specific pathways-through right-wing connections, unpaid labor, weaponizing victimhood, and gaming the attention economy-to reach a level of political power without having to put in years of drudge work.\n\nThe support DeLuca has seen on social media reflects those efforts-Kirk, for example, passionately defended her on his podcast, railing against \"typical Soviet-style indictment B.S.\" aiming to \"chill the growing young conservative movement in this country\" and labeling her one of the \"modern-day hostages being held by the regime.\"\n\nBut it also shows just how much the American public has changed its opinion on Jan. 6 since the initial aftermath, when GOP members of Congress and mainstream Republican pundits were distancing themselves from the violence. Today, when one-quarter of Americans believe that the FBI was involved in instigating or escalating that day's events, many politicians and media figures have changed their tune, arguing that the genuine Trump supporters there were merely expressing their political beliefs and that they are victims of a \" two-tiered justice system \" meant to crack down on their free speech. Trump himself has promised , on social media, that among his first acts as president will be to \"free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!\"\n\nIt's too soon to know if DeLuca will be able to capitalize on that narrative. But based on the energy of her defenders, it seems very possible that DeLuca is savvy enough to use her momentary fame as a criminal defendant to secure a prominent future place in the conservative media sphere.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "A Capitol Rioter Has Become a Right-Wing Media Darling. She Just Got Arrested.\n\nIn the three years since the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, more than 1,300 participants have been charged with crimes. But outside a few of the flashiest and most memorable characters from the day, most individual prosecutions have passed with little public note. Last Monday, however, the news of one arrest was met with more outrage: that of Isabella Maria DeLuca, a 24-year-old conservative influencer.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, on Jan. 6, 2021, DeLuca-who was arrested on Friday-entered a set of conference rooms inside the Capitol building by climbing through a broken window. She then climbed back out and was one of several people who passed a table from a Senate terrace room to rioters outside the building. The FBI testified that rioters later used the table to attack Capitol Police.\n\nAround 3 p.m. that day, she tweeted, \"Fight back or let politicians steal an election? Fight back!\" Later, according to the arrest warrant, she would express her hopes that Trump would enact martial law.\n\nAfter the news of her charges broke, DeLuca posted that she was \"facing the unwarranted targeting and persecution by the DOJ and FBI at the direction of the Biden Administration, like most J6ers.\" She added, \"This experience for me, has only served to shed light on the challenges conservative Americans, Christians, and Trump supporters face daily.\"\n\nNot long afterward, her defenders settled on a particular argument. \"Just so everyone knows the rules,\" one person posted, \"touching a table near a Capitol window is a criminal offense because someone may later use the table in a crime.\" Another: \"So now you can be arrested and charged for 'TOUCHING A TABLE.' \" And another: \"I guess 'touching a table' is a threat to democracy. This is asinine.\"\n\nHer crime was not, of course, \"touching a table.\" DeLuca was charged with theft of government property, disorderly conduct, and entering a restricted area. Video from that day shows her helping to remove the table from inside the Capitol.\n\nBut that didn't stop people from arguing that she was a victim of political persecution. Some on social media claimed that the Biden administration had gone after DeLuca specifically to send a message because of her social media presence; she has more than 343,000 followers on X. (DeLuca also, in her social media, highlighted that she was being attacked while \"illegals\" were coming into the country and claimed that more-serious criminals were escaping justice. \"I wish the seven agents that came to arrest me were instead searching for missing children and arresting child sex traffickers,\" she posted. \"Apparently, that's asking for too much.\")\n\nThe narrative took hold. Elon Musk, responding to a post from the right-wing influencer Ian Miles Cheong, replied on X that \"the Jan 6 prosecutions have gone too far.\" DeLuca's GiveSendGo (a crowdfunding platform favored by conservatives) has now raised $19,000 for her legal defense, boosted by calls for conservatives to defend their own.\n\nThis popular response was likely to some degree because DeLuca is young, blond, and conventionally attractive. DeLuca is a traditional influencer in this regard: She knows to boost her conservative political opinions with selfies and expertly posed photos directed at what appears to be her target audience of young male conservatives. Photos of her, sometimes in swimsuits, pop up in subreddits dedicated to hot conservative women. Her most popular post on X, by far, is a video of her baking: Captioned \"brown butter caramel cake is the messiest thing I've made thus far,\" it has 13 million views, in large part because of the misogynistic backlash to the tight T-shirt she's wearing in the video. The video spurred a micro news cycle on the right after some influential viewers accused it of amounting to pornographic content. She quickly hit more mainstream media when she shared screen grabs of former San Francisco Giants player Aubrey Huff flirting with her-following his remarks that, for women like her, \"sexuality is all they bring to the table.\"\n\nBut DeLuca is a savvy social media user, one who operates as a specific kind of conservative influencer: a brash, outspoken, attractive woman professing traditional ideas about gender norms, with her sexuality often framed as being reserved for a theoretical \"future husband.\" (Some misogynists who believe that these influencers are being cynically opportunistic have termed this archetype the \"tradthot.\")\n\n\"Dear future husband,\" she posted in July , to 2.5 million views, \"instead of spending my weekends out at bars and parties, I stay home and learn new recipes I can cook for you one day. You can thank me in kisses later. Love, Your future wife.\"\n\nShe mixed that in with more explicitly political posts (\"I can't wait until Trump begins the biggest mass deportation in United States history\"); sponsored posts about the film Cabrini from the Sound of Freedom 's Angel Studios; and exhortations for women to \"have lots of children,\" grow their own food, shoot guns, eat meat, and homeschool their children.\n\nAfter her arrest, DeLuca reshared a post on X confirming that she enjoys her particular place in the conservative influencer ecosystem: \"She's hot, has heavy D's, can bake and she's now being politically persecuted by Biden's regime. Wifey material right there.\"\n\nBut to reduce DeLuca to her looks is to ignore the amount of strategizing she has put into becoming a big name. DeLuca has been posting political and conservative Christian content since her teenage years. But her breakout moment came on Oct. 17, 2020, during a counterprotest against the Women's March in Washington.\n\nAt the end of that day, she posted photos of herself wearing a neck brace, with bruising on her face and an apparently bloodied mouth. DeLuca wrote on Twitter that she \"just got punched in the face and choked by two women because I was holding a Trump flag here at the Supreme Court.\"\n\nBut video from the time shows DeLuca shoving a woman with both hands, retrieving a flag from the ground, and walking aggressively toward the woman she had shoved. There's no video of what happened before DeLuca shoved the woman, so we don't know what instigated the fight; it's possible the woman had forcefully taken the flag out of DeLuca's hands. What we do know is that DeLuca appeared to escalate the fight, at the least, and that she lied when she claimed on Twitter that she \"put my hand up to retrieve [the flag] from the ground so I didn't get kicked while I was down on the ground.\"\n\nRegardless, the experience launched DeLuca into minor right-wing stardom. She was written up as the victim of rabid left-wing violence by publications like the Blaze . Fox News reported DeLuca's claims that Facebook had removed her account of the alleged assault.\n\nAnd this appears not to have been the first time she had gotten attention for being the alleged subject of an attack. In September 2019, right-wing provocateur Charlie Kirk posted a photo of himself with DeLuca. \"This is Isabella,\" he wrote on Twitter . \"She was beaten up and dragged through a parking lot for wearing a Trump shirt. The media didn't report or cover this hate crime.\"\n\nShe's been slowly growing a presence in right-wing media in the years since her Women's March experience, appearing on Newsmax and podcasts . And as the blog Angry White Men noted, she has appeared twice on a Rumble show hosted by white nationalist Stew Peters. In those appearances, she blamed feminism and other elements of the left for the \"declining white majority\"-a view that fits with a number of her posts on social media, including one about white pride .\n\nMeanwhile, DeLuca has taken more conventional pathways into Republican Party politics. In his 2019 post, Kirk noted that DeLuca was president of a Talking Point USA chapter.\n\nAt the time of the Women's March, she was outreach director for Republicans for National Renewal, a populist, pro-Trump advocacy group. (The group called Black Lives Matter a \"terrorist organization\" at the time of DeLuca's alleged assault, despite there being no evidence anyone involved in the incident represented BLM; one woman present wore a shirt that featured Black icons.) DeLuca would go on to volunteer as a \"Turning Point ambassador\" for the Tempe, Arizona-based TPUSA branch and in 2023, to speak at a Second Amendment conference in Arlington, Virginia. (She also worked as an unpaid social media associate for a foreign policy group called the Gold Institute for International Strategy. Last Monday, the organization cut ties with her.)\n\nDeLuca gained more legitimate political credentials through her work with actual lawmakers. Just three months after the Capitol riot, she began a stint as an intern at the office of then-Rep. Lee Zeldin, a major Trump ally who in 2022 became the GOP's nominee for New York governor. This would make her the first known Jan. 6 insurrectionist to take a job in Congress. Then, in 2022, she interned for Rep. Paul Gosar , another election denier. According to Politico , both Gosar's and Zeldin's offices said they had no knowledge of DeLuca's Jan. 6 activities; Zeldin's office said she had only \"volunteered unpaid to help a staff member in the district.\"\n\nSo, DeLuca is no mere social media poster: She's a woman who learned the specific pathways-through right-wing connections, unpaid labor, weaponizing victimhood, and gaming the attention economy-to reach a level of political power without having to put in years of drudge work.\n\nThe support DeLuca has seen on social media reflects those efforts-Kirk, for example, passionately defended her on his podcast, railing against \"typical Soviet-style indictment B.S.\" aiming to \"chill the growing young conservative movement in this country\" and labeling her one of the \"modern-day hostages being held by the regime.\"\n\nBut it also shows just how much the American public has changed its opinion on Jan. 6 since the initial aftermath, when GOP members of Congress and mainstream Republican pundits were distancing themselves from the violence. Today, when one-quarter of Americans believe that the FBI was involved in instigating or escalating that day's events, many politicians and media figures have changed their tune, arguing that the genuine Trump supporters there were merely expressing their political beliefs and that they are victims of a \" two-tiered justice system \" meant to crack down on their free speech. Trump himself has promised , on social media, that among his first acts as president will be to \"free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!\"\n\nIt's too soon to know if DeLuca will be able to capitalize on that narrative. But based on the energy of her defenders, it seems very possible that DeLuca is savvy enough to use her momentary fame as a criminal defendant to secure a prominent future place in the conservative media sphere.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Trump pardoned the January 6 convicts. Now his DOJ is wiping evidence of rioters' crimes from the internet\n\nFollow:\n\nAs President Donald Trump this week sought to rewrite the history of his supporters' attack on the US Capitol, a database detailing the vast array of criminal charges and successful convictions of January 6 rioters was removed from the Department of Justice's website.\n\nThe searchable database served as an easily accessible repository of all January 6, 2021, cases prosecuted by the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe US attorney's office declined to comment.\n\nRelated article They assaulted cops and tried to overturn an election. What to know about Trump's mass pardons for January 6 rioters\n\nThe removal of the comprehensive website cataloguing the largest criminal investigation in modern department history coincides with Trump's decision to pardon all convicted January 6 defendants. The president also released early from prison 14 members of far-right extremist groups, including 10 convicted of seditious conspiracy. He also asked the federal courts in Washington to dismiss the more than 300 cases that hadn't yet been resolved.\n\nJudges over the past few days have pushed back on what they called Trump's \"whitewashing\" of the mob's attack of the Capitol as the administration quickly wound down cases against some of the most violent rioters who injured police.\n\nThe DOJ site's removal was celebrated by those convicted for their actions on January 6 and their supporters.\n\n\"This is a huge victory for J6ers,\" Brandon Straka, who was among those pardoned by Trump for his role in the Capitol riot , wrote on X , adding, \"This site was one of countless weapons of harassment used by the federal government to make life impossible for its targets from J6.\"\n\nStraka credited the new Trump-appointed acting US attorney in Washington, DC, Ed Martin, for the site's removal. Martin was an organizer with the \"Stop the Steal\" movement and was involved in the financing of the January 6, 2021, Trump rally on the Ellipse that occurred directly before the attack on the Capitol.\n\nStraka wrote that he had campaigned for the site's removal because \"every time a potential employer, landlord, new social or business contact, etc, would search somebody targeted for J6 they would read a dossier on each person filled with FBI and FOJ accusations and narratives that were never proven, along with links to documents with even more damaging allegations.\"\n\nThe vast majority of the government's claims, however, were proved through the courts. About 1,250 people were convicted of crimes related to January 6.\n\nParts of the database were still accessible Sunday through the Internet Archive .\n\nNot all the information in the database was up to date, as demonstrated through a selection of pages CNN was able to access through the archived version of the site.\n\nSome pages listed only charges against individuals, rather stating what they were or were not eventually convicted of.\n\nRelated article Exclusive: January 6 rioter freed after Trump's pardon - but authorities say he should still be in jail\n\nThousands of pages that were part of the database now appear to be inaccessible. Details of January 6 cases are still accessible on the DOJ's website in the form of press releases about charges and convictions. They are also still available through court records and services such as Pacer.\n\nThe FBI - representing another leg of the Justice Department - also took offline its compendium of wanted Capitol rioters. Some of those individuals were fugitives or rioters who hadn't been identified, and the FBI had posted images and other information of the suspects it was still seeking.\n\nThe FBI and DOJ pages had also provided information about the unsolved case of two pipe bombs found outside the headquarters for the Republican and Democratic national committees on January 5, 2021. As of earlier this month, the FBI still hadn't identified the person it believed planted the two viable but unexploded bombs, despite law enforcement agencies offering a reward of up to $500,000 for information that could lead to an arrest.\n\nWhile the FBI's \" US Capitol Violence - Most Wanted\" web page is now down, news releases and a \"seeking information\" page from the agency with details about the pipe bomb suspect specifically and the reward offer are still available online.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Trump's January 6 pardon pledge baffles some attorneys\n\nDonald Trump 's pledge to pardon January 6 rioters may help fire up his supporters, but several defendants facing federal charges say they no longer believe the former President's promises.\n\nEven defendants who are holding out hope for clemency are clinging to a false hope. Most of their cases are likely to be resolved in court long before the 2024 presidential election. This week alone, following Trump's comments, seven people have cut guilty plea deals.\n\n\"What we have learned from the year that has gone by, is that my clients, apart from their families and their lawyers who are representing them, is that no help is coming,\" Joe McBride, a lawyer representing five riot defendants, including ones in jail, told CNN.\n\n\"It is us, and we're going to have to make do with what we've got,\" he added.\n\nRelated article FBI director defends handling of January 6 investigations against right-wing claims of political bias\n\nThe nationwide manhunt for the hundreds of rioters who descended on the US Capitol has become the largest criminal investigation in US history. Nearly 735 defendants, almost all of whom have professed their support for Trump, are facing charges for joining the attempt to stop the certification of Joe Biden 's electoral college win in the 2020 election, ranging from minor trespassing offenses, to assaulting police, to seditious conspiracy. The probe has also led to an unprecedented government crackdown against right-wing extremist groups, including the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.\n\nIn the past week, Trump said the January 6 defendants are being treated unfairly , while teasing a 2024 presidential run and suggesting he would pardon rioters if he were reelected.\n\n\"If it requires pardons, we will give them pardons because they are being treated so unfairly,\" Trump said during a Texas rally over the weekend.\n\nTrump repeated the promise in an interview with Newsmax on Tuesday, saying, \"I would absolutely give them a pardon\" and calling the punishment \"20 times out of proportion. These people are being persecuted.\"\n\nTrump had made similar promises back when he was still serving as President - with some January 6 rioters jailed for the 14 days at the end of the presidency. Then too, Trump didn't come through, nor has he helped January 6 criminal defendants with their legal bills.\n\n\"He could have pardoned some or all of them before he left office between January 6 and January 20 last year,\" defense lawyer Jonathon Moseley, who represents accused Oath Keepers, said on CNN's \"New Day\" this week. He pointed to earlier commitments from the former President including that he would help defendants with legal bills.\n\n\"I'm not sure exactly what people think he should have done in every case, but there is a feeling he could have done more.\" Moseley said.\n\nLawyers who represent multiple, high-profile people charged in the sprawling January 6 investigation aren't changing their legal strategies because of the former President's promises, according to the lawyers, who understand a pardon that is years away is not a viable approach to cases in court now.\n\nRelated article Oath Keepers leader answers some questions from January 6 committee, his lawyer says\n\nAnd for even the highest profile cases for defendants who maintain they are not guilty, their trials would be set for the coming months. That means that if convicted, judges could be handing down steep sentences by the end of the year - and several of the defendants facing more serious allegations related to January 6 are already sitting in jail as they await trial.\n\n\"The comments by Trump are, for J6 Defendants, more than a day late and a dollar short,\" Al Watkins, the attorney who represented Jacob Chansley, the so-called \"QAnon Shaman,\" said this week in an email. Chansley had made a public plea for a pardon while Trump was in office, then pleaded guilty this fall , telling a judge he was wrong to have broken the law by taking part in the insurrection.\n\nStill, Trump has managed to direct political conversation toward his supporters who stormed the Capitol last year - with two House Democrats investigating the Capitol attack saying they believe Trump could be tampering with witnesses.\n\nThough pardons could only apply to criminal defendants, and nearly all defendants who are charged at this time were at the US Capitol on January 6, critics of Trump have raised the possibility he could be trying to buy the silence of close advisers who didn't participate directly in the insurrection. The House select committee is seeking information from rioters, as well as Trump confidantes and supporters. There's little indication at this time that the Justice Department is targeting the advisers closest to Trump with investigations that would touch on his actions, though the Department has charged Steve Bannon and is considering whether to charge ex-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows with contempt of Congress for failing to testify under subpoena in the House investigation.\n\nRelated article January 6 committee member says Trump 'absolutely' tampering with witnesses as he continues to dangle pardons\n\nOn Friday morning, Rep. Elaine Luria, a Democrat on the House select committee, said on CNN's \"New Day\" Trump's comments \"could certainly color\" criminal defendants who are choosing between sharing facts and avoiding consequences.\n\n\"He just literally keeps restating these things very publicly and openly and to reaffirm ... what he wanted the outcome to be,\" Luria said. \"The more he does this, the more he's making a case against himself.\"\n\nElie Honig, a former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst, said the specter of future pardons could reduce a person's willingness to cooperate.\n\n\"If you think you can get the ultimate sentence reduction without cooperating, you will opt for that. Now it's more complicated in this scenario,\" Honig said.\n\n\"But again, someone who is thinking more long term could think, well, now I'm going to stretch things out,\" Honig added. \"Now I'm going to not cooperate and hope that if I do get sentenced to prison it will get cut short, if Donald Trump becomes president again.\"\n\nBut at least one lawyer has said that Trump's comments are likely to influence rioters, potentially making them less likely to accept a plea deal or to cooperate with the Justice Department's investigation.\n\n\"I think the former president continues to motivate, to impact, to suggest the actions of those who support him. He did on January 6th, and I don't think anything has changed since that time\" said attorney Robert Jenkins, who represents both members of the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters, on CNN's \"New Day\" this week.\n\n\"He is certainly putting his fingers on the scales,\" Jenkins added.\n\nAnd Shanlon Wu, a criminal defense attorney who represented a key cooperator in the Robert Mueller investigation, at a time when Trump was wielding his pardon power to keep targets of the investigation uncooperative with Mueller and loyal to him, said times have changed.\n\n\"It's different when he was the President,\" Wu said, adding that Trump's comments have been too vague, and not directed to any specific individual, to constitute real witness tampering.\n\nThe idea that Trump could pardon January 6 defendants doesn't even make logical sense to some of the attorneys.\n\nIt's so far out of their calculations, Trump's pardon comments barely even registered in the chatter on an email list used by the January 6 defense attorneys, sources familiar with the group told CNN.\n\nDefense attorneys representing January 6 defendants are looking closely at timing as their clients head to trial or consider plea deals - and pinning hope on a theoretical Trump return to the presidency three years from now isn't feasible.\n\n\"The next election is still three years away, so it's kind of premature to say I hope Donald Trump gets elected and grants pardons to my client,\" Guy Womack, who represents three January 6 defendants, said.\n\nOne of the rioters, Edward Jacob Lang , in jail now awaiting trial, said recently he felt \"completely abandoned by the political hierarchy.\"\n\nSpeaking to right-wing personality Stew Peters in a jailhouse interview last month, Lang said, \"Where are our leaders standing up? Our congressmen, our senators, our president? Trump, where are you?\"\n\n\"We're rotting in jail because we stood up for what you told us to stand up for,\" he added.\n\nRelated video 'America's crazy ex': Badly beaten during Capitol riot, ex-cop reacts to Trump remark\n\nDefense attorneys instead are aiming to slow down their cases - without 2024 in mind specifically. Some believe their clients should wait longer before cutting plea deals with the Department of Justice, because prosecutors still are demanding they agree to harsher charges and possible punishments.\n\nAnd others have said they believe cases could be dropped if evidence emerges to support right-wing theories that the insurrection was plotted by the FBI - a conspiracy authorities have repeatedly shot down .\n\nSome January 6 defendants have focused more on publicly campaigning for more leniency toward them before trial, misleadingly calling one another political prisoners.\n\nRichard \"Bigo\" Barnett, who was photographed with his feet up on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, said in court this week he is growing his goatee out until \"all the J6ers are free.\"\n\nBarnett, his lawyer McBride told CNN, believes that Capitol riot defendants are not receiving due process.\n\nRelated article In censure of Cheney and Kinzinger, RNC calls events of January 6 'legitimate political discourse'\n\nDespite their skepticism on Trump coming through for defendants, almost all of the attorneys CNN spoke to said they would still ask Trump for pardons for their own clients if he returned to office. Many are also asking for Biden to consider pardoning defendants who trespassed onto the Capitol grounds but say they were nonviolent.\n\n\"I would hope that any president, including President Biden, would grant pardons\" to people who walked in the building and quickly walked out, Womack said, referring to one of his clients, Texas realtor Jenna Ryan who was charged with a misdemeanor and sentenced to 60 days behind bars.\n\nRyan publicly asked Trump for a pardon shortly after she was arrested last year, and he didn't deliver.\n\nWomack noted this week, speaking to CNN, that Ryan isn't angry Trump didn't pardon her before he left office.\n\n\"Everyone facing criminal charges would like to receive a pardon and not have to undergo trial,\" Womack said. \"I don't think there was anything done wrongly there. And I didn't expect the President to even address it, and he didn't.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

      "text": "Trump divided America as a candidate. So far, he's doing the same as president\n\nFollow:\n\nThere are two areas of bipartisan agreement about President Donald Trump's early days back in the White House: voters say he is moving quickly to keep promises and he is far more active and visible than his predecessor.\n\nThere is, though, a giant divide over whether that is fantastic or frightening.\n\n\"Trump is being bold and thinking big,\" is the early headline from Betsy Sarcone, a Republican voter from suburban Des Moines. \"How refreshing it is to have someone who says what they mean and can coherently answer questions.\"\n\nDemocratic organizer Davette Baker of Milwaukee is on the other side of America's Trump divide.\n\n\"This man is unhinged,\" Baker said as Trump's first week back in the White House unfolded. \"The 'law and order' president isn't holding up law and order. ... And the immigration issue has everyone scared.\"\n\nRelated article Testing time: Trump's blue-collar voters want quick proof promises will be kept\n\nLinda Rooney represents a middle ground of sorts, if there is such a thing when it comes to Trump.\n\n\"On the one hand, I am glad he is cleaning up the mess Biden left, both domestically and foreign,\" said Rooney, who runs a consulting business in the Philadelphia suburb of Media. \"But I wish he would use more discernment. Not all of the January 6 people should have been pardoned. It was an attack on our democracy and on our elected leadership.\"\n\nRooney, Baker and Sarcone are among the nearly 100 voters who were part of our \"All Over The Map\" project , an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in swing states or are part of critical voting constituencies. Now, as Trump gears up quickly, these voters will help us track public sentiment about the new administration, including whether the president is losing support among those who voted for him or perhaps gaining support from those who opposed him.\n\nOur first check in suggests that their views during the campaign are largely holding, with some early markers to watch.\n\nRooney, for example, voted for Trump, then Biden, then Trump, and suburban voters like her will be critical in the 2028 midterms.\n\n\"I was optimistically hopeful after the election, but I feel he is like a bull in the china shop,\" Rooney said in a text exchange. \"Or that he's using a sledgehammer where finer instruments are called for.\"\n\nStill, she is mostly in sync with Trump promises to cut taxes and reduce regulations.\n\nRooney was a Nikki Haley primary voter who settled on Trump in the end because she believed then-Vice President Kamala Harris was too liberal and not ready for the presidency.\n\nThose who were with Trump from the beginning are exhilarated by his busy and defiant early days.\n\n\"President Trump is keeping his word,\" said Tamara Varga, a Republican small businesswoman in Tucson. \"I think he has been very transparent and that is a breath of fresh air.\"\n\nKristin Caparra, a consultant and Trump voter from the Philadelphia suburb of Drexel Hill, praised the swift confirmation of Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's efforts to challenge birthright citizenship.\n\nAnd she was struck by the changed energy level at the White House.\n\n\"The American people heard more from this president in the first 48 hours than they have heard from Joe Biden in the last two years,\" Caparra said.\n\nDebbie Katsanos, a New Hampshire Trump supporter, was more nuanced than many hardcore Trump supporters on the January 6 question. She said she believed many of those convicted were charged with more serious offenses than they deserved. Yet she also said, \"anyone justly convicted of true violence\" deserved to be punished if their sentence was fair.\n\nBut she said President Joe Biden's final day pardons made moot any continued debate over the scope of Trump's decision.\n\n\"If you want to talk about abusing the pardon system, let's talk the 11th hour pardons from President Biden,\" Katsanos said.\n\nChris Mudd, a Trump supporter who owns a solar energy company in Waterloo, Iowa, was both complimentary of Trump's early moves and candid that he will likely have to bite his tongue sometimes.\n\nRelated article Executive actions Trump has taken so far\n\n\"I like what I see so far,\" Mudd said in a text exchange. \"Ending DEI is good. I like the pardons for the J6ers. I don't  think I will like everything, but you have to take the good with the less good.\"\n\nAndrew Konchek judges Trump in a similar way. He bristles at the president's tone sometimes and disagrees with him on abortion rights and when he calls climate change a hoax.\n\nKonchek is a commercial fisherman, and on day one Trump kept the promise that won Konchek's vote: rescinding federal approval for offshore wind farms off the New England coast.\n\n\"Donald Trump is already delivering,\" Konchek said.\n\nThat truth alarms Trump critics.\n\n\"The decisions he made, particularly regarding LGBTQ+ rights and racial equity, felt like a step back,\" said Melissa Cordero, an Air Force veteran who lives in Tucson.\n\nDavid Moore,  a registered Republican but Trump critic, saw nothing to like in the early Trump actions.\n\n\"The peaceful transfer of power is so important and pardoning those who would have had it otherwise goes against a big part of what makes the United States special,\" said Moore, who runs a Western wear business steps from the US-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona. \"The immigration policies are terrible. Giving ICE permission to raid schools and places or worship is absolute fear mongering.\"\n\nTonya Rincon, a recently retired auto worker from suburban Detroit, called the sweeping January 6 pardons \"lazy and a slap in the face to law enforcement.\" Her bigger complaint, though, was Trump rolling back Biden's steps to expand access to health care and to lower prescription drug costs. \"All of which will make it harder for the neediest Americans to access basic health care,\" Rincon said.\n\nJoan London, a Reagan conservative who switched her Pennsylvania voter registration to independent because of Trump, predicted many of his new initiatives would be tied up in court battles for years.\n\nLondon, an attorney, also questioned the Trump January 6 pardons.\n\n\"I back the blue and thought that was the conservative way,\" London said.\n\nLikewise, Antonio Munoz, a retired Las Vegas police officer, said, \"Trump talks about being pro-law enforcement yet he forgave the people who cause violence against officers.\"\n\nYes, Munoz said, Trump was keeping his word.\n\n\"All we can do is wait and see,\" Munoz said. \"We all know to deport all immigrants is impossible and would hurt law abiding citizens and the economy.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Trump announced retaliatory tariffs, which Colombia responded to in kind. The US also suspended visa processing in Colombia. This comes as Trump orchestrates a broader immigration crackdown, which also saw an enforcement blitz begin in Chicago today, sources told CNN.\n\n• On the Middle East: Trump suggested Saturday that his plan for the Gaza Strip is to move more than 1 million Palestinians to other countries and \"clean out the whole thing,\" appearing to break with decades of US foreign policy.\n\n• Trump's first week: The early days of Trump's return to the White House have been marked by a flurry of executive actions on policy priorities - and by acts of political retribution against rivals.\n\nOur live coverage of Donald Trump's presidency has ended for the day. Follow the latest updates or read through the posts below.\n\nMultiple immigration actions were reported across the country Sunday, less than a week after President Donald Trump took office and instituted a sweeping crackdown on undocumented immigrants.\n\nIn addition to \"enhanced targeted operations\" announced by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Chicago , immigration actions were also reported in the Atlanta area, Puerto Rico, Colorado, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.\n\nICE reported 956 arrests and 554 detainers lodged Sunday.\n\nThe arrests are part of a broader effort to amass a larger enforcement apparatus by pulling in a range of federal agencies that have been extended immigration authority under the Trump administration.\n\nIn the Atlanta suburb of Lilburn, ICE agents arrested Walter Valladares, a 53-year-old undocumented immigrant from Honduras, according to family members who spoke with CNN. Aside from a ticket for driving without a license, for which he paid a fine, Valladares had no criminal record, his brother Edwin Valladares told CNN.\n\nIn Tucker, another Atlanta suburb, an undocumented man attending church was arrested after ICE agents arrived, pastor Luis Ortiz told CNN.\n\nNearly 50 undocumented individuals were taken into custody during a Sunday morning raid targeting drug trafficking and Venezuelan gang members in Colorado, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nThe DEA's Los Angeles office also \"conducted enhanced targeted operations\" across the city, according to a Sunday post on X .\n\nAnd in Austin, the DEA said in a Sunday post on X it was \"assisting DHS and other federal law enforcement partners with their immigration enforcement efforts.\"\n\nCNN's Josh Campbell contributed reporting to this post.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan called the immigration enforcement blitz in Chicago \"a good day\" and a \"gamechanger\" in an interview with CNN Sunday evening.\n\n\"Today's operation was all of government. President Trump has put all of government on this issue,\" he told CNN, citing ATF, FBI, DEA and US Marshals, among the agencies that joined ICE Sunday. \"We had all of government law enforcement today to focus on public safety and national security threats in Chicago.\"\n\nHoman, who was on the ground in Chicago, maintained it was a \"criminal operation\" and cited cases including sexual offenders and Venezuelan gang members.\n\nThe Chicago operation is part of a broader effort to add manpower to ICE, which has limited resources and agents, as the administration tries to ramp up arrests nationwide and amass a larger force to carry out Trump's deportation pledge. It stems from a directive from DHS last week giving Justice Department law enforcement officials immigration-enforcement authority.\n\n\"They're a force multiplier,\" Homan said.\n\n\"We're prioritizing criminal aliens,\" he said, adding, \"There's going to be a point where we have to open the aperture to fugitives.\" That can include undocumented immigrants who have a final order of removal, but, Homan said, will continue to be case by case.\n\nHoman said he hasn't placed a quota on ICE officers, saying: \"My goal is to arrest as many public safety and national security threats as possible and move on to the other priorities.\"\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson responded to the immigration enforcement blitz in the city on Sunday, noting that local police were not involved.\n\n\"Per City code, Chicago police were not involved in this immigration enforcement activity. My team and I are in close communication with City officials including the CPD. It is imperative that all Chicagoans know their constitutional rights and share the Know Your Rights guidance with their neighbors and community,\" he said in a post on X .\n\nJohnson launched a \"Know Your Rights\" campaign across hundreds of screens on mass transit buses and trains for those fearing deportation or struggling with a detained family member.\n\n\"Chicago will always be a Welcoming City, not just by ordinance, but also with our inclusive and loving spirit,\" Johnson said in an earlier news release.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spoke with the King of Bahrain Hamad al-Khalifa on Sunday, according to a readout of the call from the White House.\n\nThe two leaders discussed \"their support for regional peace,\" including \"building upon\" Bahrain's previous normalization agreement with Israel , signed during the first Trump administration, according to the readout.\n\nThe historic agreement, which Trump at the time cast as a step toward peace in the region, came as Gulf states looked to take advantage of Israel's high-tech scene and Israel looked to bolster its place in a turbulent Middle East.\n\nEconomic and foreign policy analysts are urging Colombia to take caution after getting involved in a diplomatic feud with the US over military deportation flights.\n\nA think tank of former foreign ministers and analysts urged the Colombian government on Sunday to preserve its relationship with Washington through dialogue and mutual respect.\n\n\"The Colombian Council on International Relations (CORI) calls on the national government to exercise its foreign policy with responsibility, pragmatism and strategy ... There is no room for improvisation in international relations,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThe group also said that migration flows must be addressed in compliance with bilateral agreements, noting that in 2024, 124 deportation flights were carried out from the US to Colombia with the approval of both governments, in what it called a \"historic and permanent mechanism.\"\n\nCORI added that both nations must avoid escalation and commercial retaliation, which it said would only harm Colombia.\n\nThe head of the Colombian-American Chamber of Commerce Maria Claudia Lacouture echoed those sentiments on X, saying, \"We call for sanity, dialogue and common sense, prioritizing diplomatic channels to overcome this serious crisis in the shortest possible time. Calm is important for all the actors involved.\"\n\n\"In coffee alone, more than 500,000 families depend on this sector. In flower farming, thousands of single mothers would lose their livelihood. And we can continue adding sectors that will be affected,\" she said.\n\nJordan is committed to \"ensuring that Palestinians remain on their land,\" its minister of foreign affairs said in a statement on Sunday after President Donald Trump said he spoke with Jordan's king about a plan to move more than one million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries.\n\n\"Our refusal of displacement is a steadfast position that will not change,\" Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said, \"Jordan is for Jordanians, and Palestine is for Palestinians.\"\n\nHe added: \"Ensuring that Palestinians remain on their land is a Jordanian commitment that has not changed and will not change.\"\n\nSafadi said that he looks forward to working with the new US administration and that Trump was \"clear in stating that he wants to achieve peace in the region.\"\n\nThe foreign minister also reiterated Jordan's \"firm and unchanging\" position favoring a two-state solution.\n\nApproximately 90% of Gaza residents have been displaced and Jordan is already home to more than 2.39 million registered Palestinian refugees, according to the UN.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held an introductory phone call on Sunday, according to a readout from the Pentagon.\n\nThe two discussed mutual security priorities and the ongoing threats facing both nations. Hegseth stressed the United States' commitment under President Donald Trump to ensuring Israel has the capabilities to defend itself. Both leaders agreed to maintain close communication moving forward.\n\nThe call between Hegseth and Netanyahu underscores the US' commitment to Israel, particularly in the face of ongoing security threats and the ongoing war with Hamas.\n\nThe US Embassy in Colombia's visa section is closed and has suspended visa processing in retaliation to Colombia's refusal to accept repatriation flights, the State Department said in a statement Sunday evening. CNN previously reported on the suspension of visa processing.\n\nThe suspension applies to immigrant and non-immigrant visas, which typically number in the thousands each day.\n\nAmerican Citizens Services will continue as normal, a State Department official said. They stressed that the situation is fluid.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio also authorized \"travel sanctions on individuals and their families, who were responsible for the interference of U.S. repatriation flight operations,\" according to a media note from the State Department. The move aligns with the retaliation threatened by President Donald Trump earlier in the day.\n\nThe issuance of visa restrictions on individuals from allied countries is an extraordinary move, as it is one that is typically reserved for adversaries or individuals who have committed human rights abuses or abuses of the democratic process. Colombia is a major non-NATO ally of the United States.\n\nIt is unclear how many Colombian officials the US has imposed visa restrictions on.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional details.\n\nNearly 50 undocumented individuals were taken into custody during a Sunday morning raid targeting drug trafficking and Venezuelan gang members in Colorado, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\nDrugs, weapons, and cash were seized during the raid at a \"makeshift night club\" in Adams County, north of Denver, the county's DEA posted to X. \"Dozens connected to the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang were there.\"\n\nWith the help of local and federal partners, DEA agents loaded the undocumented individuals on a bus, driving away with a police vehicle following closely behind, as seen in the agency's video on X. Of the nearly 50 people in custody, the DEA says many have TDA affiliations. CNN has reached out to the DEA for more information.\n\nThe raid comes amid a larger crackdown on immigration in the US by President Donald Trump, who has vowed to expedite the removal of undocumented gang members.\n\nTren de Aragua, a transnational criminal gang that originated in a Venezuela prison , has slowly made its way south and north in recent years. The Biden administration designated the group as a significant transnational criminal organization in June.  The move allowed the Treasury Department to essentially cut off members from the US financial system.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro rejected a US claim that he had approved two military deportation flights before abruptly rejecting them, kicking off a feud with US President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a tweet directed at US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Petro said: \"I will never allow Colombians to be brought in handcuffs on flights. Marco, if officials from the Foreign Ministry allowed this, it would never be under my direction.\"\n\nRubio said in a statement earlier Sunday that Petro had authorized the flights and \"provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air.\"\n\nA Trump administration official also told CNN that Colombia caught the administration by surprise overnight when they abruptly rejected the two military flights bound for the country carrying migrants.\n\nColombian authorities approved the two flights prior to takeoff, according to documents reviewed by CNN. Those plans were then suddenly scrapped, frustrating Trump officials.\n\nThe White House announced on Sunday the extension of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon for another three weeks after Israel did not withdraw forces from southern Lebanon as part of a ceasefire agreement from November with Hezbollah.\n\nOffering little details, the White House said in a statement, \"The arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, will continue to be in effect until February 18, 2025.\"\n\nThe White House also announced the US will facilitate negotiations between Lebanon and Israel for the release of Lebanese prisoners captured following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.\n\nThe announcement comes as at least 22 people were killed and dozens more injured by Israeli forces in southern Lebanon on Sunday after residents in the region defied orders from Israel's military not to return to their homes, the Lebanese Health Ministry said.\n\nIsrael's government said Friday that the military would not withdraw all of its forces from southern Lebanon by Sunday's deadline, blaming Lebanon for failing to uphold its end of the agreement. The Lebanese army, in turn, accused Israel of \"procrastination.\"\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro says he has ordered the country's commerce ministry to raise tariffs on US imports by 25% after President Donald Trump announced he would impose a slew of new sanctions and policies targeting the South American country.\n\n\"I am informed that you impose a 50% tariff on the fruits of our human labor to enter the United States, and I do the same,\" Petro wrote Sunday in a long X post aimed at Trump, before he announced the 25% tax on US goods.\n\nHow we got here: The US president announced the new measures targeting Colombia after it blocked US military deportation flights from landing Sunday.\n\nTrump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, say the deportation flights had initially been approved in plans between the countries, but that Colombia's president suddenly scrapped the agreement while the planes were in the air.\n\nPetro indicated on X that he objected to the use of military planes for the deportation, and to the US treatment of Colombian migrants in general.\n\nThe retaliatory sanctions announced by Trump include \"emergency 25% tariffs\" on all imports from the country that will be raised to 50% in a week, a \"travel ban\" for Colombian citizens, and a revocation of visas for Colombian officials in the US along with \"all allies and supporters.\"\n\nMore from the Colombian president: Petro responded dismissively to Trump's announcement, saying, \"Trump, I don't really like travelling to the US, it's a bit boring.\"\n\nHe went on to criticize Trump's policies and character, even suggesting that Trump considers \"me an inferior race and I'm not, nor is any Colombian.\"\n\nPetro added that Colombia \"is open to the entire world, with open arms, we are builders of freedom, life and humanity.\"\n\nEgypt rejects any forced displacement of Palestinians, the country's foreign affairs ministry said after President Donald Trump suggested a plan to move more than one million Palestinians from Gaza to Jordan and Egypt.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said he had discussed his plan to \"clean out\" the Gaza Strip with the king of Jordan and intended to raise it with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nThe statement issued by Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday did not specifically mention Trump but reiterated Egypt's position against \"the displacement of Palestinians from their land through forced eviction.\"\n\n\"Such actions threaten stability, risk extending the conflict further in the region, and undermine opportunities for peace and coexistence,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe ministry also called on the international community to support reaching a two-state solution.\n\nSome context: Trump said he would like both Jordan and Egypt - which borders the battered enclave - to house Palestinians.\n\n\"You're talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing,\" Trump said, adding that there have been centuries-long conflicts in the region.\n\nAs well as killing tens of thousands of people, the 15-month war between Israel and Hamas has reduced much of Gaza to rubble . Israeli airstrikes have damaged or destroyed around 60% of buildings, including schools and hospitals, and around 92% of homes, according to the UN.\n\nTrump's comments appear to break with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.\n\nA video of the Tuskegee Airmen, which was once a part of the Air Force's basic training curriculum, will be restored Monday following a review of the course for any diversity-related content, according to an Air Force official.\n\n\"No curriculum or content highlighting the honor and valor of the Tuskegee Airmen or Women Airforce Service Pilots has been removed from basic military training. The block in which these lessons were taught included DEI material which was directed to be removed,\" Air Education and Training Command commander Lt. Gen. Brian S. Robinson said.\n\n\"We believe this adjustment to curriculum to be fully aligned with the direction given in the DEI executive order,\" Robinson continued.\n\nPresident Donald Trump last week issued an executive order banning federal DEI programs.\n\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were the US military's first Black aviators and their support personnel. Before World War II, Black Americans were not allowed to become aviators in the military, but the US Army Air Corps created what was then an experimental training program for Black aviators at Alabama's Tuskegee Army Airfield.\n\nCNN previously reported that the video of the Tuskegee Airmen was not why the curriculum was removed.\n\n\"Historical videos were interwoven into US Air Force and Space Force curriculum and were not the direct focus of course removal actions,\" an Air Force official source previously told CNN.\n\nTwo elementary-aged sisters living in a Chicago suburb have not gone to school since President Donald Trump took office last week, according to a Chicago area nonprofit.\n\nTheir parents, who work cleaning homes and doing gig-type jobs, like landscaping, have not gone to work either, the nonprofit told CNN. Their days are filled with deep worry Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents might rush into their homes, and with anguish as they watch their groceries dwindle with no money to make rent as the end of the month approaches.\n\nThe nonprofit, which asked CNN not to publish its name or the names of the migrants due to fear of retaliation, learned about the two sisters who love coloring and unicorns and started dropping off groceries at their doorstep.\n\n\"It's frightening that this is the tip of the iceberg,\" said Sam, one of the volunteers dropping off food.\n\nSam fears the number of families sheltering in place is much larger but no one knows of their quiet suffering because they are afraid to ask for assistance.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson doubled down on Chicago's \"Welcoming City\" nature and launched a \"Know Your Rights\" campaign across hundreds of screens on mass transit buses and trains for those fearing deportation or struggling with a detained family member.\n\n\"Chicago will always be a Welcoming City, not just by ordinance, but also with our inclusive and loving spirit,\" Johnson said in a news release.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement field offices were told to meet a quota of 75 arrests per day as the Trump administration tries to dramatically ramp up apprehensions of undocumented immigrants in the US, according two sources.\n\nIn the last fiscal year, ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations conducted 113,431 administrative arrests, according to an agency report. That would be about 310 arrests a day.\n\nThe latest directive to ICE teams would pave the way to surpassing the number of daily arrests in the last year, while placing additional pressure on ICE agents as they try to meet the quota.\n\nOregon Democratic Rep. Janelle Bynum said Sunday that Trump's retaliatory tariffs on Colombia after two US repatriation flights of undocumented migrants were not allowed to land in the country will drive up costs for American consumers.\n\nTrump on Sunday announced a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the United States from Colombia after the Colombian president blocked the two flights from landing. The move is \"sensationalism\" and diverts attention from what Americans truly want, including lower prices, Bynum told CNN.\n\n\"For those of us who have to pay for our food, and for those of us who are in the restaurant and hospitality industry, for those of us who participate in trade, (the tariff) is going to levy a cost on us, and that is not in keeping with what the American people said they wanted,\" she said.\n\n\"We're taking our eye off the ball in terms of making life easier for Americans,\" Bynum added. \"We have to lower costs for Americans, we have to lower costs for small businesses, and we have to make sure we keep strong trade around the world.\"\n\nColombia caught Trump administration officials by surprise over the weekend when it abruptly rejected two military flights bound for the country carrying migrants, according to an administration official.\n\nColombian authorities approved the two flights prior to takeoff, according to documents reviewed by CNN. Those plans were then suddenly scrapped, frustrating Trump officials.\n\n\"You can't go out there and publicly defy us in that way,\" the Trump administration official told CNN. \"We're going to make sure the world knows they can't get away with being non serious and deceptive.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio later issued a statement saying Colombian President Gustavo Petro had \"authorized flights and provided all needed authorizations and then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to the Colombian government for comment.\n\nHow we got here: On Sunday morning, Petro said he was blocking US deportation flights from entering the country, saying the US \"can't treat Colombian migrants like criminals.\" He later clarified that he was taking issue with the use of military aircraft, and that civilian planes would be suitable.\n\nSources within the Colombian government were also caught by surprise by Petro's post.\n\nWithin hours, President Donald Trump announced he was issuing tariffs on Colombia, among a slew of other measures, marking the first public retaliatory action the new Trump administration has taken against another country over immigration issues.\n\nPetro has now offered his presidential plane to help repatriate deportees from the US who were set to arrive in the country Sunday morning. \"The measure responds to the government's commitment to guarantee dignified conditions,\" the presidency said in a statement, but did not provide details.\n\nDiscussions between US and Colombian officials remain ongoing.\n\nCNN's Stefano Pozzebon, Jennifer Hansler and Aileen Graef contributed to this report.\n\nThis post has been updated with a statement from the US secretary of state.\n\nThe Brazilian government has denounced what it called the \"degrading\" treatment of Brazilians who were handcuffed by their feet and hands on a repatriation flight by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying it \"violates the terms of the US agreement.\"\n\nThe US flight was bound for the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte but landed in Manaus on Friday night due to a \"technical error,\" the government said on social media. There, the Brazilian Federal Police said it discovered 88 handcuffed deportees aboard the flight. The police said they immediately released them from the handcuffs, in accordance with the country's security protocols.\n\nBrazil's foreign ministry said authorities did not authorize the plane to continue due to \"the use of handcuffs and chains, the poor condition of the aircraft, with a faulty air conditioning system, among other problems.\"\n\nThe Brazilian government said in a social media post that President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was informed about the conditions of the flight and ordered a Brazilian Air Force flight to transport the migrants from Manaus to Belo Horizonte on Saturday.\n\n\"We were handcuffed there on Wednesday night, and we got to Brazil and we still had handcuffs on, and we told them we were in Brazilian territory and to remove our handcuffs but they didn't want to take them off,\" one of the deportees said in a video published by the government.\n\n\"The indiscriminate use of handcuffs and chains violates the terms of the US agreement, which provides for the dignified, respectful and humane treatment of returnees,\" the Brazilian foreign ministry said in a news release, calling the conditions \"unacceptable.\"\n\nBrazil said it agreed to carry out repatriation flights starting in 2018 to shorten the time deportees spend in American detention centers.\n\nCNN has reached out to the US Department of Homeland Security and State Department for comment.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro is offering his presidential plane to help repatriate deportees from the US who were set to arrive in the country Sunday morning, the presidency said.\n\n\"The measure responds to the government's commitment to guarantee dignified conditions,\" the presidency said in a statement, but did not provide details.\n\nHow we got here: The announcement comes hours after Petro said he was blocking US military deportation flights from entering the country, saying the US \"can't treat Colombian migrants like criminals.\" Petro called for the US to use civilian aircraft instead.\n\nTrump responded by saying he was imposing \"emergency 25% tariffs\" on the country and threatening other retribution against Colombian officials.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he is issuing tariffs on Colombia after two repatriation flights of undocumented migrants were not allowed to land in the country , according to a post on Truth Social from the president.\n\nIt's the new Trump administration's first retaliatory action against another country over immigration issues, as Trump rolls out his promised border crackdown .\n\nTrump said he enacted a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the US from Colombia, which he said would be raised to 50% in one week.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro said earlier Sunday that he was blocking US military deportation flights into his country, stating the US \"can't treat Colombian migrants like criminals\" and insisting civilian planes be sent instead. According to a flight tracker, two US military flights bound for Colombia were turned back overnight.\n\nTrump condemned Petro's actions as a threat to US national security and public safety, asserting that Colombia had violated international obligations to accept criminals being repatriated.\n\nIn addition to the tariffs, Trump said he was calling for a travel ban and \"immediate Visa Revocations on the Colombian Government Officials, and all Allies and Supporters\" and visa sanctions on \"all Party Members, Family Members, and Supporters of the Colombian Government.\"\n\nHe also vowed enhanced Customs and Border Protection inspections for all Colombian nationals and cargo \"on national security grounds,\" and said he'd order \"IEEPA Treasury, Banking and Financial Sanctions to be fully imposed.\"\n\n\"These measures are just the beginning. We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States!\" Trump wrote in the post.\n\nVice President JD Vance said he is returning to Damascus, Virginia, on Monday, making his first official trip in office to monitor cleanup efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\n\n\"We live in the greatest country in the world. When disaster strikes, Americans ought to expect more out of their federal government. Tomorrow, I'll return to Damascus, VA to check on their cleanup from Hurricane Helene and we'll continue to do so until they've fully recovered,\" Vance wrote in a post on X .\n\nAs a candidate, Vance visited Damascus in October alongside Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin to survey the damage caused by the storm, which devastated communities in the southern Appalachians.\n\nIn an interview that aired earlier Sunday with CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Vance said \"bureaucratic red tape and garbage\" at FEMA \"prevents the rapid deployment of resources to people who need it the most.\"\n\nHe was also asked about President Donald Trump suggesting FEMA should be eliminated .\n\n\"The president, to be clear, is not saying we're going to leave anybody behind. He's saying that in the way that we administer these resources, some of which is coming from the federal level, some of which is coming from the state level, we've got to get the bureaucrats out of the way and get the aid to the people who need it most,\" Vance said.\n\nVance said the American people \"should take the president at his word that FEMA needs desperate reform, because it does.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Tom Cotton encouraged President Donald Trump to reconsider his decision to revoke security details for several former officials who have faced threats from foreign adversaries.\n\n\"I would encourage the president to revisit the decision for those people who are being targeted by Iran, as the president was targeted for assassination by Iran,\" Cotton said in an interview with CBS on Sunday.\n\nAs a member of the Intelligence Committee, Cotton said he has reviewed information that shows Iran continues to pose a threat to US officials, especially those involved in Trump's strike on Qassem Soleimani, a top Iranian commander who was killed by a US airstrike ordered by Trump in 2020.\n\n\"It's real,\" Cotton said of the threat. \"Iran is committed to vengeance against all of these people.\"\n\nCotton also said that protection for officials ensures that they are willing to assist the president on foreign policy priorities without being afraid for not just themselves, but their families and friends as well.\n\nSome background: Trump used his first week in office to exact political retribution on his perceived foes , including by revoking security clearances for his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former national security adviser John Bolton, who are both Iran hawks.\n\nImmigrant advocacy groups in Chicago filed a lawsuit Saturday against the Trump administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement saying deportation raids planned in the city are retaliatory and violate the First Amendment.\n\nThe suit was filed by Organized Communities Against Deportation, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, and Brighton Park Neighborhood Council.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim the administration's planned raids specifically target the city for its sanctuary status and amount to a violation of their First Amendment right to free speech, and Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure.\n\n\"President Donald Trump and Defendant Benjamine Huffman, the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have declared Chicago 'ground zero' for immigration enforcement; the federal government intends to 'make an example of Chicago' and quash the Sanctuary City movement,\" the plaintiffs wrote. \"The federal government's decision to target the Plaintiffs' communities because of its animus towards the Sanctuary City movement is a clear violation of the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes as multiple sources tell CNN an immigration enforcement blitz is now underway in Chicago , involving officials from several federal agencies who have been granted additional authorities to arrest undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhen reached for comment by CNN, ICE said, \"U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement does not comment on pending litigation.\"\n\nCNN has also reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who served alongside Tulsi Gabbard on the Armed Services Committee when they were both House members, said Gabbard is unqualified to serve as director of national intelligence.\n\n\"She didn't spend a lot of time showing up to hearings, so I didn't get to see her in action all that much, but from what I understand from people who have been meeting directly with her - and she hasn't asked to meet with me - is that she doesn't show the competence, the understanding, the depth,\" Slotkin said Sunday morning on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nSlotkin expressed concern over Gabbard's past sympathetic comments regarding Russia and Syria.\n\n\"Having someone in charge of our intelligence organization that shows a preference for our adversaries to me is just right off the bat a deep question,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle - who now have control of the Senate, control of the House - that they think about, again, their commitment to the country, not to any one party. I do not believe she is qualified for this role,\" she said.\n\nRead more about Trump's unorthodox pick for spy chief here.\n\nVice President JD Vance on Sunday said he stands by President Donald Trump's near-blanket pardon of convicted January 6 rioters , including those who committed violence, claiming the Department of Justice treated them unfairly.\n\n\"Violence against a police officer is not justified. But that doesn't mean that you should have Merrick Garland's weaponized Department of Justice expose you to incredibly unfair process, to denial of constitutional rights, and frankly, to a double standard that was not applied to many people,\" Vance said on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" naming Black Lives Matter protesters as an example.\n\n\"The pardon power is not just for people who are angels or people who are perfect. And of course, we love our law enforcement and want people to be peaceful, with everybody, but especially with our good cops. That's a separate issue from what Merrick Garland's Department of Justice did. We rectified a wrong, and I stand by it,\" Vance said.\n\nVance leaned heavily on his use of the term \"gray area\" when he previously said that those who committed violence on January 6 should not be pardoned, claiming the Trump administration did look case-by-case, even though nearly every single convicted rioter was pardoned.\n\n\"The full quote is that, of course, there are gray areas. And here's the nature of the gray area. Merrick Garland's Department of Justice denied constitutional protections in the prosecutions. There were double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups. What the president said consistently on the campaign is that he was going to look at a case-by-case basis,\" Vance claimed.\n\nFor context: Vance told Fox News earlier this month , \"I think it's very simple. Look, if you protested peacefully on January the 6th and you've had Merrick Garland's Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously, you shouldn't be pardoned - and there's a little bit of a gray area there, but we're very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law.\"\n\nFormer House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio, is worried the committee will focus too much on the \"elusive deep state,\" as opposed to national security issues following his removal as chair by House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"The focus should be on the committee of national security, which was what my focus has been,\" Turner said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.\n\nSome context: President Donald Trump has used his first week in office to exact political retribution against perceived foes, and has launched efforts to root out elements of the so-called deep state in Washington. Trump has helped make a crusade against supposed enemies within the federal workforce a defining issue for Republicans, but the definition of \"deep state actors\" is often applied broadly to those who would oppose the president's policies.\n\nMore from Turner: The lawmaker said Sunday that he thought after initially speaking with Johnson, that one \"element\" that led to his removal as committee chair were \"concerns from Mar-a-Lago\" - a reference to Trump's Florida estate.\n\nTurner said Johnson later walked that back, and that the president's staff had since been in touch with him to assure him that was not the case.\n\nDespite being removed as chair, Turner will still play a role on other national security efforts in Congress, including leading the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and remaining on the Armed Services Committee.\n\nTurner has been a staunch advocate for the United States' continued support of Ukraine, even as Trump has expressed skepticism at the degree of US aid , and some in his party have called for it to end .\n\nThe Trump administration launched an immigration enforcement blitz in Chicago on Sunday that includes several federal agencies who have been granted additional authorities to arrest undocumented immigrants in the United States, according to multiple sources.\n\nIt's part of a broader effort to add manpower to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has limited resources and agents, as the administration tries to ramp up arrests nationwide and amass a larger force to carry out the president's pledge.\n\nICE agents are expected to be joined by officials from multiple Justice Department agencies as they target public safety and national security threats. It's a multi-day operation that will spread across the country.\n\nSome background: Late last week, acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued a directive giving Justice Department law enforcement officials immigration-enforcement authority. The agencies include the FBI, DEA, ATF, US Marshals Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\n\"Mobilizing these law enforcement officials will help fulfill President Trump's promise to the American people to carry out mass deportations,\" Huffman said in a statement announcing his directive.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan has previously said that if other undocumented immigrants are encountered over the course of their operation, they may also be arrested or detained. Homan is in Chicago to oversee operations, according to one of the sources.\n\nActing Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove is in Chicago Sunday to observe immigration enforcement operations alongside Homan.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that an American citizen was released from detention in Belarus.\n\n\"Thanks to @POTUS leadership, Belarus just unilaterally released an innocent American, ANASTASSIA Nuhfer, who was taken under JOE BIDEN!,\" Rubio posted on X.\n\nAccording to a State Department spokesperson, Nuhfer had been detained in December 2024. The spokesperson said the US was granted a consular visit to her about three weeks ago. Typically, the State Department does not have consular access to citizens in Belarus, because of strained relations between the US government and the regime of Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nSome context: The timing of the release of the American is notable, as Lukashenko may be looking to garner favor with the Trump team as he continues to cling to power after another \"sham election\" Sunday.\n\nUnder the first Trump administration, the US had sought diplomatic rapprochement with Minsk. Those efforts were put aside after Lukashenko self-proclaimed electoral victory and massive crackdown on protesters and civil society in August 2020, which Trump administration officials condemned at the time.\n\nLukashenko's government continues to detain more than a thousand political prisoners, and the US has hit Belarus with a slew of sanctions for its support of Russia's war against Ukraine and its crackdown on civil society.\n\nAfter casting the tie-breaking vote to officially confirm President Donald Trump's controversial defense secretary , Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance called Hegseth a \"disruptor\" and someone who is going to change the department and \"fix the problems\" - regardless if people don't like it.\n\n\"Pete is a disruptor, and a lot of people don't like that disruption, but Margaret, that disruption is incredibly necessary,\" Vance said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"We need a big change.\"\n\n\"We have to really, top to bottom, change the way that we fund the procurement of weapons, the way that we arm our troops. This is a major period of disruption, and we think Pete Hegseth is the guy to lead the job,\" the vice president said.\n\nVance also dismissed criticism against Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard , expressing confidence that she will ultimately be confirmed.\n\n\"The Senate will provide advice and consent, as is its constitutional obligation, but I feel confident that Tulsi Gabbard will ultimately get through,\" Vance said.\n\nClaiming that \"bureaucrats\" at intelligence agencies have \"gotten out of control,\" Vance said someone is needed to \"rein them in and return those services to their core mission of identifying information that's going to keep us safe.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance said Sunday that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops have \"not been a good partner in common sense immigration enforcement,\" and as a devout Catholic, he hopes \"that they'll do better.\"\n\nThe group issued a statement earlier this week criticizing several of President Donald Trump's executive actions cracking down on immigration , including allowing federal immigration authorities to arrest people at churches and schools.\n\n\"As a practicing Catholic, I was actually heartbroken by that statement,\" Vance said.\n\nVance suggested the council may have \"bottom line\" reasons for their stance.\n\n\"I think that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops needs to actually look in the mirror a little bit and recognize that when they receive over $100 million to help resettle illegal immigrants, are they worried about humanitarian concerns? Or are they actually worried about their bottom line?\" Vance said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nThe Catholic bishops' statement said, in part, \"While an emphasis on anti-trafficking is welcomed, several of the executive orders signed by President Trump this week are specifically intended to eviscerate humanitarian protections enshrined in federal law and undermine due process, subjecting vulnerable families and children to grave danger.\"\n\nVance was asked by CBS' Margaret Brennan about his personal views on ICE targeting immigrants inside churches and schools, after Trump ended a long-standing policy against the practice.\n\n\"If you have a person who is convicted of a violent crime, whether they're an illegal immigrant or a non-illegal immigrant, you have to go and get that person to protect the public safety,\" Vance said.\n\nPressed again if he personally supports ICE going into churches and schools, Vance said, \"I support us doing law enforcement against violent criminals, whether they're illegal immigrants or anybody else, in a way that keeps us safe.\"\n\nVance also argued that Trump's actions \"empowered law enforcement to enforce the law everywhere.\"\n\n\"But that also has a knock-on effect - a chilling effect, arguably, to people to not send their kids to school,\" Brennan said.\n\n\"I desperately hope it has a chilling effect on illegal immigrants coming into our country,\" Vance said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Adam Schiff called Trump's recent firing of 18 inspectors general \"a clear violation\" of the law in a Sunday interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nThe president is required by law to give Congress a 30-day notice before terminating a person serving in the independent watchdog role. Inspectors general are charged with identifying and reporting fraud and mismanagement within government agencies.\n\n\"The American people, if we don't have good, independent inspectors general, are going to see the swamp refill, they're going to see rampant waste fraud, they're going to see corruption,\" Schiff said.\n\nOn January 6 pardons: Schiff also addressed Trump's recent pardoning or commutation of nearly 1,600 people arrested in relation to their activities at the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.\n\n\"It sends the message to others out there, if you use violence to keep Donald Trump in power, or use violence in the service of Donald Trump, he will have your back,\" he said.\n\nSchiff was among the members of the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot who received a preemptive pardon from former President Joe Biden, after Trump's vows to pursue political and potentially legal retribution against members of the panel.\n\nSchiff, who had been vocal that he did not want to receive the pardon, said it is now uncertain whether he has the ability to reject it.\n\n\"The law is unclear because this is frankly uncharted territory, whether pardons of this nature are like a law, in which you're powerless to say yea or nay or there's something different,\" he said.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro announced Sunday he is blocking US military deportation flights, marking an example of the headwinds the Trump administration faces as it tries to ramp up removals.\n\nTwo US military flights bound for Colombia overnight were turned back, according to a flight tracker, after Petro wrote in a post on X that he was denying entry for the aircraft.\n\nIn another post , Petro left the door open to receiving migrant flights, but called on the US to use civilian planes and establish better protocols for their treatment of migrants.\n\nWhile Colombia cannot allow migrants to remain in a country that does not want them, they must be sent back \"with dignity and respect for them and for our country. We will receive our fellow citizens on civilian planes, without treating them like criminals,\" the Colombian president wrote.\n\nCNN has reached out to Colombian officials for comment. The Defense Department referred CNN to the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMore on the administration's deportation efforts: US President Donald Trump will be forced to navigate some of the same hurdles as his predecessors in getting certain countries to take back their nationals. That's been a challenge for countries with which the US has frosty relations, such as Venezuela, and may also be an issue with countries resistant to the Trump administration.\n\nOn Thursday, the US returned migrants to Guatemala via military aircraft. The US is also leaning on Mexico to repatriate its nationals. That continues at land ports of entry along the US southern border, though Mexico also appeared to turn around a military flight bound to the country last week.\n\nTrump officials are returning to a hardline approach meant to get countries receiving deportees to comply, as they make broader attempts to curb migration to the US.\n\nThis post has been updated with Petro's statement indicating he would accept civilian flights, but not US military flights.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe says the agency is getting \"off the sidelines\" following the release of a \"low confidence\" judgement that Covid-19 originated from a lab leak in China.\n\n\"The CIA has assessed that the most likely cause of this pandemic that has wrought so much devastation around the world was because of a lab-related incident in Wuhan, and so we'll continue to investigate that moving forward. But I think it was important for the American people to see an institution like the CIA get off the sidelines and be truthful about what our intelligence shows, at the same time of protecting us from adversaries like China if they caused or contributed to this,\" he said to Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures.\n\nKey context: The CIA i ssued a statement Saturday saying it now assesses the virus that causes Covid-19 more likely originated from an accidental lab leak in China, rather than occurring naturally.\n\nThe agency has for years said it did not have enough information to determine which origin theory was more likely - and its new assessment is only a \"low confidence\" judgment. It still deems a natural-origin scenario possible.\n\nA US official emphasized the new assessment predates the Trump administration. The agency's director under former President Joe Biden, Bill Burns, had pushed analysts to take a position on the origins of the pandemic, and this assessment was made and published within the US government before President Donald Trump took office Monday, the official said.\n\nThe determination to declassify and make that assessment public represents one of the first major moves by Ratcliffe, who has long favored the theory that the pandemic originated from research being done in China.\n\nThe Trump administration's threats to arrest and deport law-abiding immigrants in Illinois were \"quite disturbing,\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday.\n\n\"They're going after people who are law-abiding, who are holding down jobs, who have families here, who may have been here for a decade or two decades,\" the Democratic governor said.\n\n\"And they're often our neighbors and our friends. Why are we going after them? These are not people who are causing problems in our country. What we need is a path to citizenship for them. We need to secure our border. We need to get rid of the violent criminals, but we also need to protect people, at least the residents of Illinois and all across the nation who are just doing what we hope that immigrants will do,\" he said on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nPritzker also downplayed the Trump administration's memo threatening to prosecute state and local officials in sanctuary cities who resist, obstruct or fail to comply with federal lawful immigration commands and requests. He said Illinois law prevents local officials from coordinating with federal officials when they don't have a warrant, noting that has always been the law.\n\n\"We are not going to help federal officials just drag them away because somebody pointed at them and said, 'Oh, that person is brown,' or 'That person is not from here, check it out, maybe they're undocumented,'\" he said.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan said the successful implementation of President Donald Trump's plan for mass deportations will depend on the amount of money Congress appropriates toward immigration efforts, and said he's being \"realistic\" about the likelihood of deporting all immigrants who entered the country illegally, as Trump has previously proposed.\n\nHoman told ABC News on Sunday there's \"no number\" of deportations in particular he views as being needed to view Trump's immigration agenda as successful.\n\n\"My success is going to be based on what Congress gives us. More money, the better we're going to do,\" Homan said.\n\nThe border czar said military flights to deport undocumented immigrants will continue daily.\n\n\"(The Department of Defense) has helped administrations before, but not at this level. So it's a force multiplier, and it's sending a strong signal to the world. Our border's closed,\" he said.\n\nHoman said Americans should expect military flights to be conducted daily and the administration's deportation targets to expand over time.\n\n\"You can see the numbers steadily increase - the number of arrests nationwide - as we open up the aperture. Right now it's considering public safety threats, national security threats. That's a smaller population. So we're going to do this on priority base as President Trump's promised. But as that aperture opens, there'll be more arrests nationwide,\" Homan said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday that President Donald Trump should have informed Congress about his rationale for firing inspectors general from more than a dozen federal agencies in a Friday night purge.\n\nBut, speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" the longtime Trump ally also defended the idea of the president putting his own people in the key watchdog roles.\n\n\"Yeah, I think you know, yeah, he should have done that,\" Graham said, when asked by CNN's Dana Bash about the 30-day notice the president was required by law to give lawmakers about the firings. \"But the question is, is it OK for him to put people in place that he thinks can carry out his agenda? Yeah.\"\n\n\"He feels like the government hasn't worked very well for the American people. These watchdog folks did a pretty lousy job,\" the South Carolina senator said. \"He wants some new eyes on Washington. That makes sense to me.\"\n\nSome context: During Trump's first term, he gutted his administration of independent government watchdogs he saw as disloyal. An IG conducts investigations and audits into any potential malfeasance, fraud, waste or abuse by a government agency or its personnel, and issues reports and recommendations on its findings.\n\nOn January 6 pardons: Graham also said he did not like that Trump's blanket pardon of people convicted for the January 6 insurrection included those who attacked police officers.\n\n\"No, I've always said that. I think when you pardon people who attack police officers, you're sending the wrong signal to the public at large, and that's not what you want to do to protect cops. But he has that power,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump indicated Saturday that he had spoken with the king of Jordan about potentially building housing and moving more than 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries, a remarkable proposal from a sitting US president that would appear to break with decades of US foreign policy.\n\nTrump said he asked Jordan's Abdullah II, a key US partner in the region, to take in more Palestinians in a Saturday phone call. He said he'd also like to speak with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi about whether Egypt could build more homes for Palestinians, saying \"I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.\"\n\nJordan's state news agency Petra reported the call with Trump , but made no mention of relocating Palestinians.\n\nThere has long been a fear in the region that Israel wants to push Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries - a premise Israel rejects, but one supported by far-right factions of its governing coalition.\n\nHere's how some in the region are responding to Trump's suggestion:\n\n• Amit Segal, an analyst with Israeli network Channel 12 News, cited Israeli officials and reported that the move was \"not a slip of the tongue but part of a much broader move than it seems, coordinated with Israel.\" CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.\n\n• Bassem Naim , a senior Hamas official, said Palestinians \"will not accept any proposals or solutions\" from Trump on leaving their homeland, even if they are \"seemingly well-intentioned under the guise of reconstruction.\"\n\n• Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, said he \"completely rejected\" Trump's comments.\n\n• Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich - who has long advocated removing Palestinians from the strip and instituting Israeli rule - was quick to endorse Trump's latest comments, saying \"the idea of helping (Gazans) find other places to start new, better lives is a great idea.\"\n\nKey powers in the region including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan have not yet responded to Trump's most recent proposal.\n\nEgypt's El-Sisi previously criticized Israel's move to force the evacuation of more than a million residents from northern Gaza in October 2023, characterizing it as part of a larger plan to rid the entire area of Palestinians. Jordan's King Abdullah also previously called the idea of more Palestinian refugees moving to Jordan or Egypt a \"red line.\"\n\nAfter voting against Pete Hegseth's confirmation as secretary of defense Friday night, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski insisted she is not concerned about political retribution - and did not rule out opposing more of President Donald Trump's nominees .\n\n\"It should not be a situation where you feel that you can't exercise your conscience, your judgment because of fear of retribution or retaliation,\" the Alaska lawmaker said. \"This is still America, as best I know, and I'm proud to be one.\"\n\nPressed on whether she would oppose some of Trump's more controversial nominees, including Tulsi Gabbard, Kash Patel and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Murkowski did not rule it out. Instead, she said she is waiting to hear what comes out of their confirmation hearings.\n\n\"None of the three that you have just mentioned have gone through their nomination hearings,\" she said, adding, \"I have a relatively thorough process, and it starts with the one-on-one sit-downs.\"\n\nMurkowski said she's had those sit-downs with all three of the nominees mentioned, and that now she has more reading to do before watching their confirmation hearings.\n\n\"Whether it's them or anybody else that's on the roster, I take my responsibility seriously with each and every one,\" the Republican said.\n\nMurkowski also responded to Trump saying he was \"surprised\" by her opposition to Hegseth - who faced a slew of allegations of past wrongdoing and questions about his relevant leadership experience - noting that she hadn't spoken to the president about it, and that it should be well known by now that she will vote her conscience.\n\nAs President Donald Trump this week sought to rewrite the history of his supporters' attack on the US Capitol, a database detailing the vast array of criminal charges and successful convictions of January 6 rioters was removed from the Department of Justice's website .\n\nThe searchable database served as an easily accessible and up-to-date repository of all January 6, 2021, cases prosecuted by the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe US Attorney's Office declined to comment.\n\nThe removal of the comprehensive website cataloguing the largest criminal investigation in modern department history coincides with Trump's decision to pardon all convicted January 6 defendants. The president also released early from prison 14 people convicted of seditious conspiracy and asked the federal courts in Washington to dismiss the more than 300 cases that hadn't yet been resolved.\n\n\"This is a huge victory for J6ers,\" Brandon Straka, who was among those pardoned by Trump for his role in the Capitol riot , wrote on X , adding, \"This site was one of countless weapons of harassment used by the federal government to make life impossible for its targets from J6.\"\n\nRead more about how both judges and others pardoned are reacting to the move.\n\nPresident Donald Trump indicated Saturday that he had spoken with the king of Jordan about potentially building housing and moving more than 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries, a remarkable proposal from a sitting US president.\n\nTrump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he asked Jordan's Abdullah II, a key US partner in the region, to take in more Palestinians in a Saturday phone call.\n\nTrump said he would also like Egypt - which borders the battered enclave - to house people, and that he would speak to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi about the matter on Sunday.\n\n\"You're talking about a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing,\" Trump said.\n\nCalling Gaza a \"demolition site,\" Trump added: \"I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.\"\n\nThe president, a former property developer, said that the potential housing \"could be temporary\" or \"could be long-term.\"\n\nKey context: Trump's comments appear to break with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.\n\nThere has been an enduring fear in the region that Israel wants to push Palestinians out of Gaza into neighboring countries - a premise Israel rejects but one supported by far-right factions of its governing coalition.\n\nAmit Segal, an analyst with Israeli network Channel 12 News, cited Israeli officials and reported that the move was \"not a slip of the tongue but part of a much broader move than it seems, coordinated with Israel.\"\n\nA source familiar with the matter confirmed the reporting to CNN but gave no further details. CNN has reached out to the US State Department for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump dismissed reports that the White House is in talks with Oracle to obtain TikTok as the clock ticks on an extension to sell the popular app to US ownership.\n\nHe said he \"never spoke\" to Oracle chief Larry Ellison about the app, but added, \"I've spoken to many people about TikTok. And there's great interest in TikTok. And as you know I have the right to sell it, or close it, depending on what I think is best for the country. So we'll make a decision on it in the next 90 days or so.\"\n\nTrump told reporters there are \"numerous people talking to me - very substantial people - about buying it,\" and he would be making a decision \"probably over the next 30 days.\"\n\n\"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States would be a big beneficiary if we do. I'd only do it if the United States benefits,\" he said.\n\nCNN has reached out to Oracle and TikTok for comment.\n\nSome background: Trump issued an executive action Monday delaying enforcement of the federal ban on TikTok for 75 days. The action directs the Justice Department not to enforce the law, which passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress and was signed in April by former President Joe Biden. The law required that starting January 19, TikTok be banned in the United States unless it sells to a buyer from America or one of its allies.\n\nA familiarity with the gears of government has helped President Donald Trump's team move with much more speed and sweep in their first week than they did eight years ago, issuing a blizzard of executive actions and reaching down into agencies across Washington to put his agenda and personnel plans in place.\n\nIt's far too early, of course, to know whether the perpetual sense of chaos that hung over the West Wing during the first four years will ultimately return during Trump's second term.\n\nSome Trump allies remain skeptical the president will be able to avoid it, given his own appetite for pitting advisers against each other. In some ways, the chaos is now just part of the program as Trump tests the bounds of his presidential authority , inviting legal challenges and backlash even from Republicans.\n\nBut if the opening days signaled fewer attempts to control Trump, a concerted effort to instill discipline among staff was palpable.\n\nThat task rests with Susie Wiles, the new White House chief of staff, who ran Trump's campaign with a discipline that's mostly been lacking in Trumpworld.\n\nShe arrived inside the building well ahead of Trump on Monday to begin the job in earnest, settling into her corner office with a fireplace and back patio. She has spent considerable time in the Oval Office this week, watching a few steps away from the Resolute Desk during executive order signings, meetings with Congressional leaders and Cabinet nominees.\n\n\"That's all Susie can do - control what she can control - and that is zero tolerance for staff infighting,\" a veteran of the fractious first Trump administration told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to openly discuss the dynamics of the West Wing.\n\nA critical question facing Trump in his second term was not answered during his first week back in power: Will he devote more time and energy to the future or the past? It was a mix of both, but backward-looking recriminations were more present than Wiles and some other advisers would prefer.\n\nRead more on the mood inside the White House here.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, President Donald Trump repeatedly suggested that his perceived enemies should be jailed, from the prosecutors in the Biden administration Justice Department who indicted him, to members of the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nNow in office, Trump has kept up the same rhetoric, even if some of his targets received a preemptive pardon from Biden.\n\n\"I was going to talk about the things that Joe did today with the pardons of people that were very, very guilty of very bad crimes, like the Unselect Committee of political thugs,\" Trump said of the January 6 committee in remarks following his inaugural address.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order directing his Justice Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence to open broad investigations into Biden administration \"weaponization\" of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n\nTrump also issued an order pardoning more than 1,000 people charged in the Capitol attack - the most sweeping action in his long-running effort to rewrite the history of January 6 and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, which had led to now-dropped federal charges against him brought by former special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nIf Trump actually directed his Justice Department to investigate former President Joe Biden himself, he would face a key roadblock because of his own legal battles last year: The Supreme Court ruled in Trump's challenge to the special counsel's January 6 indictment that presidents have \"absolute immunity\" related to their official actions.\n\nRead more on Trump's first week in office here.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes sentenced to 18 years in prison for plot to keep Trump in power\n\nStewart Rhodes , the founder and leader of the Oath Keepers, was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Thursday for leading a far-reaching plot to keep then-President Donald Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election.\n\nA second Oath Keepers member, Kelly Meggs, the leader of the Florida contingent of the group, was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\nThe sentences are the first handed down in over a decade for seditious conspiracy.\n\n\"What we absolutely cannot have is a group of citizens who - because they did not like the outcome of an election, who did not believe the law was followed as it should be - foment revolution,\" District Judge Amit Mehta said before handing down the sentence. \"That is what you did.\"\n\n\"I dare say, Mr. Rhodes - and I never have said this to anyone I have sentenced - you pose an ongoing threat and peril to our democracy and the fabric of this country,\" Mehta said.\n\nThe judge added: \"I dare say we all now hold our collective breaths when an election is approaching. Will we have another January 6 again? That remains to be seen.\"\n\nMehta said Rhodes, 58, has expressed no remorse and continues to be a threat.\n\n\"A seditious conspiracy, when you take those two concepts and put it together, is among the most serious crimes an American can commit,\" the judge said. \"It is an offense against the government to use force. It is an offense against the people of our country.\"\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Mehta ruled that Rhodes' actions amounted to domestic terrorism.\n\nRelated article Capitol riot victims recount their experiences ahead of Oath Keepers seditious conspiracy sentencing\n\n\"He was the one giving the orders,\" Mehta said. \"He was the one organizing the teams that day. He was the reason they were in fact in Washington DC. Oath Keepers wouldn't have been there but for Stewart Rhodes, I don't think anyone contends otherwise. He was the one who gave the order to go, and they went.\"\n\nRhodes was convicted of seditious conspiracy by a Washington, DC, jury in November in a historic criminal trial that was a test of the Justice Department's ability to hold January 6 rioters accountable and validated prosecutors' arguments that the breach of the Capitol was a grave threat to American democracy.\n\nThe seditious conspiracy charge has rarely been brought in the century and a half that the statute and its forerunners have been on the books.\n\nUS Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who testified earlier this week about his experience on January 6, told CNN that Donald Trump should be \"next.\"\n\n\"It is a step towards full accountability,\" Dunn said. \"His lawyers argued that Donald Trump is the root of the problem, and I totally agree. Let's get him next.\"\n\n\"I have a hard time finding joy or celebration in a sentence of 18 years,\" Dunn said. \"I believe that justice shouldn't be celebrated - it should be expected.\"\n\nCNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said the sentencing should have a \"chilling effect on these groups,\" especially as the presidential election season begins.\n\n\"This tough sentence is going to make the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, all these organizations, it's going to make them more difficult for them to recruit and, as important, for them to raise money,\" Kayyem said.\n\nProsecutors had asked for Meggs to be sentenced to 21 years in prison, saying that \"with the possible exception of Stewart Rhodes, Meggs was the intellectual and moral center of this conspiracy.\"\n\nMehta addressed Meggs and the larger issue of how the Capitol attack happened.\n\n\"You don't take to the streets with rifles,\" Mehta said. \"You don't hope that the president invokes the Insurrection Act so you can start a war in the streets ... you don't rush into the US Capitol with the hope to stop the electoral vote count.\" If we do, he added, \"we will slowly but surely descend into chaos.\"\n\n\"It is astonishing to me how average Americans somehow transformed into criminals in the weeks before and on January 6,\" the judge said. \"Regrettably, Mr. Meggs, everything you worked for, everything you built ... vanished in a couple of months.\"\n\nHe added: \"For reasons that are unclear to me, planning and scheming to bring rifles to Washington, DC, became more important than maybe even your own family.\"\n\nUnlike Rhodes, Meggs showed contrition for his actions on January 6 and apologized to his family members in the courtroom through tears.\n\n\"I am sorry to be involved in an event that put such a black mark on our country,\" Meggs told the judge.\n\nExplaining the differing sentences Thursday, Mehta said Rhodes was a more dangerous person.\n\n\"He is not Mr. Rhodes. He's just not,\" the judge said of Meggs. \"He does not pose the same kind of threat as Mr. Rhodes. He is not the intellectual and spiritual leader.\"\n\nProsecutors had asked Mehta to sentence Rhodes to 25 years behind bars, and to apply the enhanced terrorism sentencing penalties.\n\n\"This is terrorism,\" prosecutor Kathryn Rakoczy said Thursday.\n\n\"It is not blowing up a building directly or telling someone to blow up a building, but in light of the threat of harm and historic nature of attempting to stop the certification of an election for the first time in American history,\" Rhodes and other Oath Keepers leaders should be punished more harshly, she said.\n\nRhodes, who was accused of leading dozens other individuals in a coordinated plot that culminated in the January 6 siege, was also found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding and tampering with documents.\n\nOf those that Rhodes led, 22 have already been convicted of various federal crimes by a jury or guilty plea. Eight, including Rhodes' codefendant Meggs, were convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nRhodes, before he was sentenced, said he was a \"political prisoner\" and vowed to continue to \"expose the criminality of the regime\" in prison.\n\n\"I'd like to start by just saying that I'm a political prisoner, and like President Trump, my only crime is opposing those who are destroying our country,\" Rhodes told Mehta in court.\n\nFor 20 minutes, Rhodes relitigated allegations that the 2020 presidential election was unconstitutional and shouted that he was \"not able to drop that under my oath\" during his military service and \"not able to ignore the Constitution.\"\n\nThe leader repeatedly defended his and his followers' actions on January 6, saying that \"no Oath Keeper took part in any of the fighting\" and that the violence at the Capitol was \"all done by other people.\"\n\n\"I believe this country is incredibly divided, and this prosecution - not just mine but all the J6ers - is making it worse,\" Rhodes said.\n\nHe continued, \"I believe every J6er is a political prisoner and all of them are being grossly overcharged. It is going to make people feel like this government is even more illegitimate than they did before.\"\n\nTrump said during a recent CNN town hall that if elected to a second term he would pardon many rioters who were convicted for their roles in the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nThough he said he would not be able to pardon all January 6 rioters, Trump vowed to pardon \"a large portion of them.\"\n\nMichael Fanone, a former Washington, DC, police officer who was attacked on January 6, called the prospect of Rhodes potentially getting pardoned by Trump \"outrageous.\"\n\n\"It should outrage all Americans,\" Fanone said on CNN's \"News Central\" Thursday. \"Stewart Rhodes was convicted by a jury of his peers for his actions, which resulted in the injuries sustained by myself and hundreds of other police officers on January 6. Not to mention the fact that America became a national and international embarrassment on the world stage.\"\n\nFanone said it was \"sickening\" that Trump has \"aligned himself\" with people like Rhodes via the statements he made during the CNN town hall and what he continues to say \"on a daily basis.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Sydney Kashiwagi contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "February 21, 2025: Donald Trump presidency news\n\n• Pentagon purge: In an unprecedented purge of the military's senior leadership , President Donald Trump tonight fired the top US general while his defense secretary dismissed the chief of the US Navy and others. Separately, the Pentagon said it plans to fire 5-8% of the military's approximately 950,000 civilian employees .\n\n• Big court rulings: The Supreme Court dashed Trump's plan to immediately fire the head of an independent agency that investigates whistleblower claims. In other rulings, a federal judge allowed the administration to move forward with its dismantling of USAID , while another judge temporarily blocked the administration from carrying out certain DEI directives .\n\n• Media lawsuit: The Associated Press is suing three administration officials in federal court for banning AP reporters from some of the president's events.\n\n• Trump again slams Zelensky: Trump continued to rail against Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a radio interview - though he admitted Russia attacked Ukraine.\n\nOur live coverage of Donald Trump's presidency has moved here.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency's access to sensitive Treasury data remains blocked after split rulings today from federal judges in Virginia and New York.\n\nUS District Judge Rossie D. Alston of Virginia declined to block DOGE's access to sensitive data at Treasury Department and the Office of Personnel Management as a judge in a separate case in New York ordered that a hold she had placed on DOGE access to sensitive Treasury data systems would continue.\n\nWhile the Virginia ruling was a win for the Trump administration, the Treasury Department will still have to abide by US District Judge Jeannette Anne Vargas's order in the New York case halting it from giving affiliates of DOGE access to its systems containing sensitive data.\n\nAlston, however, rejected the request in his court for intervention because, he wrote Friday, the \"Plaintiffs' fears of future harm are much too speculative and would require the Court to make several leaps in reasoning in order to warrant injunctive relief.\"\n\nAt a hearing Friday morning, Alston also addressed the direction most courts have gone in denying emergency orders in cases challenging the DOGE's team efforts to seize the keys of closely guarded data systems at various agencies.\n\n\"I think it's important that on a nationwide basis, we have consistency in what we are doing,\" said Alston, who sits on a federal court in Alexandria.\n\nLess than three years before Elon Musk tapped him to take part in a sweeping overhaul of the US government, Edward Coristine, then 17, was the subject of a heated dispute between two executives at the Arizona-based cybersecurity firm where he was an intern.\n\nAt issue was whether to allow Coristine to keep his job even though he was suspected of leaking proprietary information to a competitor.\n\n\"You're willing to risk our entire network to a 17-year-old?\" one frustrated executive asked the company's CEO in 2022. \"Are you for real right now?\"\n\nIn a recording of the call, reviewed by CNN, Marshal Webb, the CEO of Path Network, a company that offers services to protect businesses from cyberattacks, defended his decision.\n\nHe said he wanted to allow Coristine to continue with his internship, in part, because he didn't want to make him \"an enemy\" or have him \"running amok\" with information he was suspected of taking. Webb allowed him to stay with the proviso that the young employee \"not be exposed to anything that's really sensitive.\"\n\nThat was then.\n\nToday, the 19-year-old, once known by the online moniker \"Big Balls,\" is part of Musk's controversial effort to remake the federal government. He is a \"senior advisor\" with access to various departments, including Homeland Security, FEMA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nThe details of Coristine's role with the government are not clear. But his young age and relative lack of experience have raised concerns about his overall suitability for such potentially sensitive work.\n\nRead more about the recording here.\n\nSteve Bannon, the former Donald Trump White House aide and conservative media founder, offered guarded praise for Elon Musk following his appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference this weekend, despite the history of friction between the two, saying that Musk is \"probably, on the oligarch side, the least offensive, as far as that goes.\"\n\nAsked about his recent criticism of Musk, Bannon denied that he was changing his tune, characterizing the relationship as an \"alliance of convenience.\"\n\n\"Look, with all the oligarchs, and he's probably, on the oligarch side, the least offensive, as far as that goes - none of them are our allies. They're just - it's an alliance of convenience. Because we won, they joined us,\" Bannon told CNN. \"They can't be trusted. They can't be trusted because they're oligarchs. They don't have any vested - they're not vested in our system. They're going to always go where power is. And I keep telling people, they will flip on us as soon as it's convenient to go to the other side, because they're all progressive Democrats.\"\n\nBannon praised the work being done by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in the new Trump administration while saying he retained his skepticism toward Musk.\n\n\"I thought Elon's answers were fine, right?\" Bannon said when asked to react to Musk's appearance at CPAC on Thursday . \"I don't agree with Elon on everything, but the one thing I do think is very powerful is DOGE are like, it's like a shock to the system, right?\"\n\nBannon has directed more critical rhetoric at Musk lately, clashing with the DOGE leader over policy, some relating to immigration. Earlier this week, Bannon criticized Musk and other tech billionaires in the president and questioned their support of the MAGA movement.\n\nWatch Bannon's interview with CNN's Donie O'Sullivan.\n\nPresident Donald Trump claimed Friday that the US and Ukraine are \"pretty close\" to agreeing on a rare earth mineral deal. A US official backed up Trump's claim, saying that a deal is \"nearly done.\"\n\nEarlier, President Volodymyr Zelensky had said that he hopes for a \"fair\" agreement with the US.\n\nThe Ukrainian president had previously rejected a draft agreement that he said was demanding Kyiv \"give away\" 50% of Ukraine's rare minerals while offering no security guarantees in exchange.\n\nTalks between the two sides have been intensive and ongoing, sources say, but have made progress over the past 24 hours. It wasn't clear when or if an announcement would come, or what the parameters of the deal would be.\n\nHere's what else you should know:\n\nUS special envoy to Ukraine in Kyiv:\n\nTrump's comments on Zelensky and the war:\n\nPresident Donald Trump fired the top US general on Friday night in a move that had been expected for weeks.\n\nIn an announcement on his Truth Social platform, Trump called Joint Chiefs Chairman Charles Q. Brown a \"fine gentleman\" and an \"outstanding leader,\" while hinting at more firings to come.\n\n\"Finally, I have also directed [Defense] Secretary [Pete] Hegseth to solicit nominations for five additional high level positions, which will be announced soon,\" he wrote.\n\nHegseth called Brown by phone on Friday and told him of the decision to remove him as the military's top general, according to a US defense official.\n\nBrown's firing had been anticipated for weeks, with rumors about the impending dismissal circulating around the Pentagon. But speculation about the termination of Brown and others became more serious when a formal list was recently shared with some Republican lawmakers .\n\nMinutes after Trump's posting, Hegseth released a statement in which he fired Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the chief of the Navy and the first woman to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nIn his 2024 book titled \"The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,\" Hegseth called Franchetti a \"DEI hire.\"\n\nAfter Brown's ouster, a prominent retired four-star general expressed serious dismay over the move, given the top military adviser has traditionally remained in place as administrations change. The general told CNN the move was \"sadly political and tragic for our nation.\"\n\nRead more details here about the firings at the Pentagon.\n\nThis post was updated with more details on the firings and a reaction from a retired general.\n\nA federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out certain directives of the president to crack down on diversity, equity, and inclusion - or DEI - programs.\n\nUS District Judge Adam Abelson said that the government could neither freeze or cancel \"equity-related\" contracts nor require recipients of grants to certify that their programs do not promote DEI.\n\nThe government is also not allowed to bring any False Claims Act enforcement action, under the judge's preliminary injunction order.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Saturday, according to a Trump administration official.\n\nTrump will address the conservative gathering in Oxon Hill, Maryland, tomorrow afternoon.\n\nEarlier Friday, Duda shared on X that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called him and they \"had a candid conversation on the heels of the recent meetings\" with Keith Kellogg , Trump's special envoy on the Ukraine conflict.\n\n\"I conveyed to him that we consistently believe there is no other way to stop the bloodshed and achieve lasting peace in Ukraine except with the support of the United States,\" Duda wrote of his conversation with Zelensky. \"For this reason, I suggested to President Zelenskyy to remain committed to the course of calm and constructive cooperation with @POTUS Donald Trump. I trust that good will and honesty form the foundation of the U.S. negotiation strategy. I have no doubt that President Trump is guided by a deep sense of responsibility for global stability and peace,\" he added.\n\nRemember: Long-simmering tensions between Zelensky and Trump boiled over this week as US officials met with Russia about a potential deal to end its war in Ukraine, spurring fears in Kyiv and across Europe that Trump would ice out Zelensky and European leaders in seeking to resolve the conflict.\n\nTrump falsely called the Ukrainian president a \"dictator without elections\" and echoed Russian justifications for the war, while Zelensky said Trump was living in a \"web of disinformation.\"\n\nWhile Kellogg struck a conciliatory tone about Zelensky on Friday, Trump continued to rail against the Ukrainian leader in a radio interview.\n\nFBI Director Kash Patel told employees Friday that he plans to move more agency jobs from the Washington, DC, region to field offices around the country and an FBI facility in Alabama, as part of a broader strategy to move resources away from the bureau's headquarters, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n\nThe email, sent shortly after he was sworn in as director , echoed themes that Patel has focused on as part of his criticism of the FBI.\n\nPatel began his first day on the job at FBI headquarters, leading the morning meeting with senior FBI leaders he helped install before his confirmation. In his evening email, Patel said that he told FBI leadership he will \"reduce the footprint of the National Capital Region,\" by moving more employees to regional field offices and to the FBI's Redstone Arsenal campus in Huntsville, Alabama.\n\n\"My priority is to support and drive even more impactful investigations,\" Patel wrote in the email. \"Enhancing the field resources and bolstering our operational capabilities are the most effective ways to protect the American people.\"\n\nThe FBI has about 1,300 employees at its Huntsville facility and has moved some operations there as part of a strategy that began in 2016 to reduce its Washington footprint.\n\nPatel previously threatened that if he took over the FBI, he would shut down its headquarters and turn it into a museum. During his confirmation hearing this month, Patel was confronted with those comments and told Democratic Sen. Chris Coons that he meant the FBI needed to move more agents and its investigative focus into the interior of the country to protect Americans.\n\nNew York City is taking legal action against the Trump administration after it clawed back $80 million out of the city's bank accounts that were supposed to help pay for migrant services last week, filing a lawsuit Friday.\n\n\"FEMA took back the funds it paid the City on February 4, 2025, even though it had thoroughly reviewed and analyzed the extensive supporting documentation submitted by the City and approved payment as reimbursement for eligible and compliant expenditures under two federal grants awarded under the Shelter and Services Programs,\" the complaint states.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York alleges the Federal Emergency Management Agency illegally seized the money without notice or due process motivated by political opposition to FEMA's Shelter and Services Program. The money was appropriated by Congress and granted to multiple localities dealing with the influx of migrants.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to have the funds returned to the city.\n\n\"The $80 million that FEMA approved, paid, and then rescinded - after the city spent more than $7 billion in the last three years - is the bare minimum our taxpayers deserve. And that's why we're going to work to ensure our city's residents get every dollar they are owed,\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement.\n\nThe federal clawback followed a threat by Elon Musk to revoke funds issued by FEMA.\n\nThe funds were appropriated by Congress during the previous administration to help the city pay for migrant hotels and other services.\n\nThe $80 million dollar claw back ignited political backlash across city lawmakers who say Adams is beholden to the Trump administration after the Department of Justice issued a directive ordering corruption charges against the mayor to be dropped .\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memo Friday directing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to block Chinese investments in areas pertaining to national security, such as artificial intelligence.\n\nThe memo also seeks to fast-track foreign investment in US projects but prohibit US companies from making investments that further the causes of the Chinese government. It did not spell out exactly how it would accomplish that.\n\nThe executive action comes after Chinese hackers breached CFIUS' database in December, which was part of a broader incursion into the Treasury Department's unclassified system, CNN reported.\n\nThe Biden administration took similar actions with rules that were finalized last year, which restricted US investments in Chinese industries in an effort to protect national security.\n\nA New York federal judge on Friday extended her earlier block on Department of Government Efficiency representatives' access to sensitive data at the Treasury Department.\n\nHowever, US District Judge Jeannette Anne Vargas declined to take more sweeping steps requested by the Democratic-led states that brought the lawsuit in her court to curtail DOGE activity at the department.\n\nVargas' new order is a preliminary injunction, which, unlike the temporary restraining order she previously handed down, is subject to appeal. That sets up the possibility for the issue of DOGE's access to closely guarded government data systems to travel up to higher courts, including the Supreme Court.\n\nThe judge said she'd consider modifying the current order once the Treasury showed DOGE employees were given proper training and vetting for accessing the data system. She is giving the government until March 24 to file a submission laying out the steps it has taken.\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) is suing three Trump administration officials in federal court for banning AP reporters from some of President Donald Trump's events, the Oval Office and Air Force One.\n\nThe AP alleges the ban violates the First Amendment as well as the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe suit names three defendants: Trump White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, and Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich.\n\nThe AP is seeking an emergency hearing and a court order to declare the ban unconstitutional and require them to rescind it.\n\nSome background: Earlier this month, the AP, one of the world's largest news outlets, was singled out by the White House for continuing to use the phrase \"Gulf of Mexico\" even though Trump renamed the body of water \"Gulf of America.\"\n\nOther countries do not recognize the new name, and the AP is a global news outlet with customers all around the world, so its stories - and influential stylebook - are still referring to the \"Gulf of Mexico\" while also acknowledging Trump's decree.\n\nThe ban was first implemented on February 11 . Top AP editors immediately described it as a First Amendment violation but tried to resolve the dispute behind the scenes before resorting to legal action.\n\nWhat's in AP's legal filing: The White House has ordered its journalists \"to use certain words in its coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access,\" the AP's lawyers wrote in the complaint. \"The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government.\"\n\n\"The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech. Allowing such government control and retaliation to stand is a threat to every American's freedom,\" they added.\n\nLeavitt responds: Leavitt sidestepped questions about the conflict at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, saying she had just learned of the suit on her drive over for an on-stage interview.\n\n\"We'll see them in court,\" the press secretary said, acknowledging she'd been personally named in the complaint.\n\nCNN's David Wright contributed to this report.\n\nThis post has been updated with Leavitt's comments at CPAC.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a new memo directing the Office of the US Trade Representative to investigate a reciprocal response to countries that have digital services taxes, or DSTs.\n\nDSTs tax the gross revenue that online firms collect from offering services to users. A country with a DST would be able to tax all the revenue large companies that operate online collect - even if the business is unprofitable. That can include what they collect from selling data, advertising as well as payments they receive for subscriptions, software and other kinds of online services users pay for.\n\nAmerican firms, namely Big Tech companies such as Meta, Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are disproportionately affected by DSTs, according to a report published last year by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\n\n\"What they're doing to us in other countries is terrible,\" Trump said Friday before signing the memo. He declined to share how high reciprocal tariffs on countries with DSTs could go.\n\nThe United States does not have a DST. They are most prominent across several European countries as well as India, where DST rates are among the highest worldwide.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday claimed the US and Ukraine and \"pretty close\" to agreeing on a rare earth mineral deal.\n\n\"I think we're pretty close. I think they want it. They feel good about it, and it's a significant - it's a big deal, but they want it, and it keeps us in that country, and they're very happy about it,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"We get our money back.\"\n\nPeople familiar with the matter also said US officials believe they are nearing an agreement with Ukraine on a deal to secure rights to the country's rare earth minerals.\n\nTalks between the two sides have been intensive and ongoing, the people said, but have made progress over the past 24 hours. It wasn't clear when or if an announcement would come, or what the parameters of the deal would be.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that he hopes for a \"fair\" minerals agreement with the US. He had previously rejected a draft agreement that he said was demanding Kyiv \"give away\" 50% of Ukraine's rare minerals while offering no security guarantees in exchange.\n\n\"We're going to sign a deal to get security, because we have to do that. We're spending our treasure. They're spending their blood. They are - and they're very brave, and you know, in every way you can imagine - but we are spending our treasure on some country that's very, very far away, and it's OK, but we have to be treated the same as Europe is being treated,\" Trump also said.\n\nTrump dismissed reports that he is traveling to Moscow on May 9 and again didn't answer a question about whether he considers Russian President Vladimir Putin a dictator, a label he's applied to Zelensky.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday stopped President Donald Trump's plan to immediately fire the head of an independent agency that investigates whistleblower claims, allowing Hampton Dellinger to remain in the job through at least the middle of next week.\n\nBy declining to back Trump's emergency appeal, the conservative court nominally sided with Dellinger. President Joe Biden appointed Dellinger in 2024 to lead the Office of Special Counsel for a five-year term.\n\nTrump White House officials fired Dellinger in a brief email days after the president took office.\n\nIn an unsigned order, the court said it would hold the case on pause until February 26, when a temporary order handed down by a lower is set to expire.\n\nThe Department of Education's civil rights division said it is launching Title IX investigations into Maine's Department of Education related to claims it is violating President Donald Trump's executive order banning transgender women from competing in women's sports.\n\nThe announcement comes after a tense exchange between Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills and President Donald Trump earlier Friday. Trump threatened to strip Maine of its federal funding if the state refuses to comply with his order, prompting the governor to respond: \"See you in court.\"\n\n\"Today the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) sent a letter to the Maine Department of Education Commissioner Pender Makin announcing that OCR is initiating a directed investigation of the Maine Department of Education (MDOE) amid allegations that it continues to allow male athletes to compete in girls' interscholastic athletics and that it has denied female athletes female-only intimate facilities, thereby violating federal antidiscrimination law,\" the department's statement said. \"The letter also notifies MDOE that OCR is launching an investigation into Maine School Administrative District #51 (MSAD #51), after it was reported that Greely High School, a school under its jurisdiction, is continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls' categories.\"\n\nTrump's executive order argues that under Title IX, \"educational institutions receiving Federal funds cannot deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump said today he's considering changes to the US Postal Service , which has been an independent organization for more than 50 years.\n\nIt's a move that could be a first step toward privatization that could upend how Americans get critical deliveries including online purchases, prescription drugs, checks and vote-by-mail ballots. Current law requires the USPS to deliver to all addresses, even rural ones that are too costly for a private business to serve profitably. Even many online purchases handled by private companies such as United Parcel Service depend upon the the Postal Service to handle the \"last mile\" of delivery to homes.\n\nThe USPS now potentially joins other federal agencies going through a massive reorganization under the Trump administration.\n\nTrump has already moved to fire other members of governing federal agencies, such as the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, leaving those agencies without the minimum number of members needed to act to provide protections to members of the public.\n\nHere's what else happened today:\n\nThis post was updated with details on the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe Pentagon announced Friday that it anticipates ultimately firing 5 to 8% of the military's approximately 950,000 civilian employees , with an initial tranche of 5,400 probationary workers who don't have \"mission-critical\" roles expected to be terminated next week.\n\nWhile that is a small percentage of the 55,000 probationary employees who were at risk of being fired en masse, the eventual cuts could amount to a significant reduction in the civilian workforce.\n\n\"We anticipate reducing the Department's civilian workforce by 5-8% to produce efficiencies and refocus the Department on the President's priorities and restoring readiness in the force,\" Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Darin Selnick said in a statement.\n\nThat would mean eventually 47,000 to 76,000 people in total could be let go.\n\nEarlier on Friday, CNN reported the Defense Department had temporarily paused a plan to carry out mass firings of civilian probationary employees until Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the Pentagon's Office of General Counsel can carry out a more thorough review of the impacts such firings could have on US military readiness, according to two defense officials familiar with the matter.\n\nSelnick said the first 5,400 employees could be fired early next week, and more could be terminated \"as we conduct a further analysis of our personnel needs, complying as always with all applicable laws.\"\n\n\"As the Secretary made clear, it is simply not in the public interest to retain individuals whose contributions are not mission-critical,\" he added. \"Taxpayers deserve to have us take a thorough look at our workforce top-to-bottom to see where we can eliminate redundancies.\"\n\nThe pause on firing a broader swathe of civilian employees all at once came after CNN reported on Wednesday that the mass terminations, which could affect over 50,000 civilian employees across the Pentagon, could run afoul of Title 10 section 129a of the US code .\n\nFollowing that report, Pentagon lawyers began reviewing the legality of the planned terminations more closely, the officials said.\n\nKash Patel said he is \"living the American dream\" after being sworn in today as FBI director by Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\n\"You're talking to a first-generation Indian kid who's about to lead the law enforcement community of the greatest nation on God's green earth. That can't happen anywhere else,\" Patel said.\n\nHe said President Donald Trump's faith in him to lead the FBI is the \"greatest honor that I'll ever have in my life.\"\n\nTurning to the task ahead of him, Patel said there \"will be accountability within the FBI and outside of the FBI and we will do it through rigorous Constitutional oversight starting this weekend.\"\n\nTurmoil in the bureau: Earlier this month, the fate of thousands of FBI officials was in the balance as the Justice Department demanded they fill out a questionnaire about any involvement in investigating the January 6, 2021, US Capitol riot, a move employees believe is meant to be a precursor to mass firings.\n\nThe unusual demand for FBI employees to explain their role in an investigation comes as CNN has reported that Trump's Justice Department is considering expanding its purge of bureau personnel.\n\nSome background: The Senate voted to confirm Patel on Thursday , installing the conservative firebrand at the head of the nation's top law enforcement agency. The vote was 51 to 49, with Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining with Democrats in voting against his confirmation.\n\nCNN's Josh Campbell, Danya Gainor, Jim Sciutto and Dan Berman contributed reporting to this post.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday that the \"European Union wants to come back\" after the group of countries, according to the president, \"treated us very badly.\"\n\n\"The European Union wants to lower their tariffs because of the fact,\" he said.\n\nHe called the EU's signaling to lower tariffs a \"big start in the right direction with the European Union.\"\n\nHoward Lutnick was sworn in today as Commerce secretary in the Oval Office by Vice President JD Vance.\n\nLutnick, who was formerly the CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, promised to \"balance the budget\" and cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in his new job.\n\n\"And then we are going to grow this economy in a way that people have never seen,\" he said in remarks before he was sworn in.\n\n\"Donald Trump understands global business. It's the first time you put in that chair the greatest business man in the United States of America,\" Lutnick added, pointing to the Oval Office desk.\n\nThe Commerce secretary is tasked with supporting US businesses and often acts as an emissary between other nations to negotiate trade deals and increase foreign investment. There are 13 bureaus housed under the Commerce Department, including the Census Bureau, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nUS stock markets fell sharply Friday after an economic report showed American consumers are growing increasingly fearful of price increases and how President Donald Trump's tariffs could reignite the inflation crisis.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 748 points, or 1.7%. The broader S&P 500 also sank 1.7% and the Nasdaq was 2.2% lower. The Dow tumbled for the second consecutive day, falling about 1,200 points over the course of Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe University of Michigan's latest survey , released Friday, showed that US consumer sentiment declined in February for the second consecutive month, according to a final reading, down by a steep 10% from January. That was double the decline initially reported earlier this month.\n\nThe survey found that Americans are losing confidence in the economy, driven primarily by worries over Trump's tariffs potentially jacking up prices.\n\nA new CNN poll released Thursday similarly showed pessimism on the rise because of prices: Nearly two-thirds of US adults nationwide, 62%, said they feel Trump isn't doing enough to address inflation. The Michigan survey showed Americans are now fearful of higher inflation on the horizon.\n\nInvestors grew fearful that weak consumer sentiment could lead to a pullback in Americans' shopping habits. Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of the US economy.\n\nA federal judge is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nUS District Judge Carl Nichols, appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term, rejected a request from unions representing USAID workers to indefinitely block the administration's plans to shutter the agency while their legal challenge to it played out.\n\nThe decision is likely to be appealed.\n\nMore background: This is the latest case in which a judge has had to decide if the court has an immediate role in blocking Trump's plans to reduce the federal workforce, especially at agencies his administration is moving toward dismantling.\n\nPreviously, two other federal judges, in Boston and Washington, DC, have told unions that their attempts to block the administration from cutting the federal workforce didn't belong in court, and instead could be looked at by a labor board.\n\nThe administration's efforts to shutter USAID have become a major flashpoint during the opening days of Trump's second term, with employees describing in court filings harrowing stories of how the rushed process to upend the aid agency has placed them in risky and sometimes dangerous situations.\n\nThis post was updated with background on today's ruling.\n\nA decades-old Department of Agriculture scholarship program aimed at putting young people at Historically Black Colleges and Universities on the path to careers in agriculture, food safety and environmental science has been suspended by the agency, according to its website.\n\nEstablished in 1992, the 1890 Scholars Program provides recipients with full tuition fees, books, room and board at 1890 land-grant universities.\n\nDemocratic members of Congress slammed the program suspension, arguing that it is evidence of further hostility toward marginalized groups following executive orders aimed at dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives across the government.\n\n\"The 1890 Scholars Program is a direct response to the USDA's own history of racial discrimination. Killing it now sends a dangerous message that equity and opportunity no longer matter. I'm calling on the USDA to reverse this disgraceful decision immediately and fully reinstate the program - no delays, no excuses,\" Rep. Jonathan L. Jackson of Illinois said in a statement.\n\nJackson, a member of the Agriculture Committee, said 1890 land-grant institutions educate over 20% of Black students pursuing agricultural degrees.\n\nRep. Alma S. Adams of North Carolina, a member of the bipartisan HBCU Caucus, also criticized the move, saying, \"This program is a correction to a long history of racial discrimination within the land-grant system, not an example of it.\n\n\"I demand USDA immediately rescind this targeted and mean-spirited suspension and reinstate the 1890 Scholars Program, for which the deadline for students to apply was originally March 1, 2025,\" Adams said in a statement.\n\nHouse GOP leaders plan to take a critical first step to jumpstarting Donald Trump's legislative agenda on Tuesday as they bring their sprawling budget blueprint to the floor, according to two GOP sources.\n\nIf approved, the House GOP budget measure would allow Republicans to begin drafting legislation that spends $4.5 trillion on tax cuts and $300 billion in border and military programs. It would also lift the debt limit for roughly two years as Trump has requested.\n\nBut it's not yet certain if Speaker Mike Johnson has the votes for the measure, which also instructs Congress to cut a whopping $2 trillion from government programs. Some GOP members fear this could be felt largely in Medicaid and food assistance programs.\n\nThe Senate GOP passes its own budget measure early Friday morning, which is a far narrower plan to advance only pieces of Trump's agenda.\n\nSome House lawmakers are raising \"deep alarm\" over the Department of Government Efficiency's interactions with NASA and potential conflicts of interest in a new letter released Friday.\n\n\"The lack of transparency surrounding DOGE's presence and activities within NASA is ominous and unacceptable,\" reads the letter, which is signed by three Democrats in leadership positions within the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.\n\nThe note, which is dated February 21 and addressed to acting NASA chief Janet Petro, calls out the space agency for failing to answer a list of questions and concerns laid out in a letter sent by lawmakers earlier this month .\n\nAmong the frustrations: NASA has not revealed the name of the DOGE representative that the agency said is embedded at the space agency, described what information that person has had access to, or provided details about what NASA will do to prevent conflicts of interest.\n\nThe letter's signatories are Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the space and technology committee; Rep. Valerie Foushee, the ranking member on the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee; and Emilia Sykes, ranking member on the House Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight.\n\nMore context: Elon Musk's involvement with DOGE - and the department's access to data across the federal government - has sparked a number of conflict of interest concerns. But those questions are particularly glaring at NASA, as the space agency holds \"proprietary data from NASA contractors, some of whom compete directly with SpaceX,\" the Democratic lawmakers wrote in their February 21 letter.\n\nSpaceX also holds billions of dollars worth of contracts with the space agency.\n\nActing Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Caleb Vitello is being removed from his role at the agency amid frustration over a slowdown in arrests in the interior of the US, according to multiple sources.\n\nDespite denying publicly that he's unhappy with the levels of deportations, President Donald Trump, who selected Vitello to fill the post, has complained privately about it to his top immigration aides, according to several people familiar with the matter.\n\nVitello, a career government official, is expected to be reassigned.\n\n\"The Acting Director of ICE is not being fired - he is no longer in an Administrative role, but is overseeing all field and enforcement operations: finding, arresting, and deporting illegal aliens, which is a major priority of the President and Secretary,\" said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the move.\n\nTension between the White House and ICE has heightened in recent weeks. CNN previously reported that senior Trump officials have expressed frustration with ICE in calls for not meeting its marks.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday that he wasn't happy with the number of arrests so far . \"ICE is doing a great job,\" he said. \"I'm not happy with the numbers because we got a lot of criminals to find.\"\n\nEarlier this month, two senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were reassigned amid mounting pressure from the White House to ramp up arrests.\n\nIn a tense exchange today with Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, President Donald Trump threatened to strip Maine of its federal funding if the state refuses to comply with his executive order banning transgender women from competing in women's sports.\n\n\"I understand Maine - is Maine here, the governor of Maine?\" Trump said addressing Republican and Democratic governors in the State Dining Room in the White House. \"Yeah, I'm here,\" Mills said. \"Are you not going to comply with it?\" Trump said. \"I'm complying with state and federal laws,\" Mills said. \"Well, we are the federal law,\" Trump said. \"Well, you better do it, you better do it because you're not going to get any federal funding at all if you don't. And by the way, your population, even though it's somewhat liberal - although I did very well there - your population doesn't want men playing in women's sports. So, you better comply, because otherwise you're not getting any, any federal funding,\" the president said. Former Vice President Kamala Harris carried more than 52% of the vote in Maine, winning three of its four electoral votes. Mills responded: \"See you in court.\" \"Good, I'll see you in court, I look forward to that,\" Trump said. \"That should be a real easy one. \"And enjoy your life after governor, because I don't think you'll be in elected politics.\"\n\nSome background: Trump's executive order argues that under Title IX, \"educational institutions receiving Federal funds cannot deny women an equal opportunity to participate in sports.\"\n\nIn response to the president's threat: Mills later issued a statement . \"If the President attempts to unilaterally deprive Maine school children of the benefit of Federal funding, my Administration and the Attorney General will take all appropriate and necessary legal action to restore that funding and the academic opportunity it provides,\" she said. \"The State of Maine will not be intimidated by the President's threats.\"\n\nCNN's Donald Judd contributed reporting.\n\nLegal service providers assisting unaccompanied migrant children can resume their work, according to a Department of Interior memo obtained by CNN, canceling a previous directive issued by the Trump administration.\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Interior sent an order to providers saying that all activities \"may resume.\" It did not provide an explanation.\n\nRemember: Earlier this week, the Trump administration ordered legal service providers working with unaccompanied migrant children to stop their work, prompting panic and concern among groups representing children.\n\nIt's the latest example of whiplash for legal service providers representing immigrants - in this case, children who arrived at the US-Mexico border without their parents.\n\nThe memo came as a relief to groups like Acacia Center for Justice, a nonprofit that assists nearly 26,000 children.\n\n\"We welcome the news that the stop-work order on Acacia's Unaccompanied Children Program has been lifted,\" Shaina Aber, executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, said in a statement. \"We will continue working alongside the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that these critical services upholding the basic due process rights of vulnerable children are fully restored and our partners in the legal field - legal lifelines safeguarding the rights and well-being of children seeking safety - can resume their work without future disruption or delay,\" Aber added.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said Friday that she is reviewing the list of accused sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's clients for potential public release.\n\n\"It's sitting on my desk right now to review. That's been a directive by President Trump. I'm reviewing that,\" she said in an interview with Fox News.\n\nBondi added that she was also reviewing \"JFK files and MLK files\" for potential release.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order to release files related to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n\"Have you seen anything where you just said, 'Oh my gosh,'\" Fox News host John Roberts asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" she said.\n\nRemember: Epstein's former pilot, Larry Visoski, testified in Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking trial in 2021 that a who's who of powerful men, including President Donald Trump, flew aboard Epstein's private plane . Camera footage unearthed by NBC News in 2019 from a party at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in 1992 captures Trump greeting party guests, dancing with young women and, in some clips, speaking into Epstein's ear.\n\nTrump has previously said that while he and Epstein spent time together in the 1990s, Trump later banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago and severed ties, though he has declined to discuss details publicly.\n\nDescribing the situation at their workplace as an \"environment of chaos\" and \"very scary,\" dozens of current and former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attended a rally Friday at the Georgia State Capitol. Many were holding signs with messages like \"CDC Saves Lives\" and \"CDC Makes America Great.\"\n\nAmong those attending was Emaad Hassan, a public health advisor who worked at the CDC for 10 years, more recently with the immunization group and previously abroad with the health security program in countries like Pakistan, Egypt and South Sudan.\n\nHassan told CNN that he received a letter putting him and others on administrative leave prior to their termination effective March 14. According to Hassan, he was incorrectly put on a list of probationary workers, even when he was a full-time employee.\n\n\"I reached out to HR several times. HR is aware of the issue. They just don't want to talk about the topic. They're petrified. They're fearful. It's created this environment where everybody is fearing retribution,\" Hassan said.\n\nSonya Arundar, a health communicator and online information user experience specialist who was hired by the CDC in December, was also among those impacted by the layoffs. Two days after February 14, the day the layoffs were announced and a date described by employees as \"Valentine's Day Massacre,\" she received a letter via email notifying her that she was being terminated \"for poor performance.\"\n\n\"I was so new that I didn't have a performance review yet, even though my manager seemed to be very pleased with my work. I know two people personally who did have good performance reviews who were also fired in the same way,\" said Arundar, who described what the CDC is currently going through as \"an environment of chaos.\"\n\nThe Trump administration told US government scientists working on a vital global climate report to stop their work, according to a scientist involved in the report - the latest move to withdraw the US from global climate action and research.\n\nThe US had been highly involved in planning for the next installment of the report due out in 2029 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world's leading scientific authority on climate change.\n\nThe IPCC assesses how the climate crisis is affecting the planet according to the latest science. Its reports take thousands of scientists many years to produce and are used to inform policymakers across the world of the risks posed by global warming.\n\nIn a sense, all of the world's current, accepted knowledge about climate change stems from the IPCC and its reports, the first of which was published in 1990.\n\nAn international meeting of IPCC authors that was scheduled to take place in China next week is now in limbo. Kate Calvin, NASA's chief scientist and senior climate adviser, was supposed to co-chair the discussion but was impacted by the stop-work order, according to the scientist involved in the report. The meeting was planned to talk about next steps in the development of the report.\n\nThe person told CNN they were \"not sure what this means for the planned work going forward, or if US scientists will participate in the writing of the IPCC reports.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to Calvin, the White House and the IPCC for comment. News of the stop-work order was also reported by Reuters.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has \"no cards\" and is not \"important to be at meetings,\" as he warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could take all of Ukraine \"if he wanted\" on Friday.\n\n\"I've been watching for years, and I've been watching him negotiate with no cards. He has no cards. And you get sick of it. You just get sick of it. And I've had it,\" Trump said in an interview on Fox News Radio's \"The Brian Kilmeade Show\" after Kilmeade pressed him on Russia being to blame for the war.\n\n\"He's been at a meeting for three years, and nothing got done. So, I don't think he's very important to be at meetings, to be honest with you,\" Trump continued about Zelensky. \"He makes it very hard to make deals. But look what's happened to his country, it's been demolished.\"\n\nThe US president also said Putin could take all of Ukraine \"if he wanted,\" adding that's why Zelensky should be working toward a deal with the nation that invaded nearly three years ago.\n\n\"He wants to make a deal,\" Trump said of Putin: \"And he doesn't have to make a deal, because if he wanted, he'd get the whole country.\"\n\nTrump slammed former President Joe Biden and Zelensky, accusing them of not doing enough to work toward a compromise that could have averted Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\n\"Putin could have been talked out of that so easy, but they didn't know how to talk,\" Trump said. Trump said he was \"not trying to make Putin, like, nicer or better,\" but added the war never should have happened.\n\nHe also expressed disappointment with Zelensky's rejection of the rare earth minerals deal.\n\nKash Patel is set to begin his first day as the director of the storied Federal Bureau of Investigation on Friday.\n\nPatel, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, will be sworn in at the White House and then will begin his tenure at the bureau's J. Edgar Hoover Building in downtown Washington, DC.\n\nPatel was confirmed to the post in a close Senate vote on Thursday.\n\nHis first days in the position coincides with a continuing upheaval at the bureau over a list of details of more than 5,000 FBI employees' who worked on January 6-related cases that was gathered as part of a survey and handed over to Justice Department leadership. The FBI is also dealing with a stream of senior officials who either resigned or were asked to leave.\n\nIn a letter to his new colleagues obtained by CNN, Patel said that his \"commitment has always been - and always will be - to pursuing justice and upholding the rule of law.\"\n\n\"My priorities for our organization are twofold,\" Patel wrote. His first priority is giving agents the \"tools\" to keep America safe, including efforts to streamline the FBI's \"operations at Headquarters while bolstering the presence of field agents across the nation and collaborating even more closely with our essential partners in state and local law enforcement.\"\n\nSecond, he said, is \"to ensure we rebuild the American people's trust in the FBI.\"\n\nPatel's nomination faced intense scrutiny from Democrats on Capitol Hill who have warned that he is poised to use the position to seek retribution against Trump's perceived political enemies.\n\nCNN's Josh Campbell contributed reporting to this post.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday repeatedly ignored questions on Fox News radio about Russia being to blame for the war in Ukraine before eventually admitting, \"Russia attacked,\" and then going on to fault the Biden administration and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\"Russia attacked, but there was no reason for them to attack, you could have talked him out,\" Trump said of Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview with Fox host Brian Kilmeade. \"That whole thing was going on for years, there was no reason he was going in. It should have never happened.\"\n\nThe remark came after Kilmeade repeatedly told Trump that Putin was to \"to blame\" for the war, saying it was an \"unwarranted invasion\" and asking repeatedly, \"You agree, right?\"\n\nTrump claimed Russia would have not invaded Ukraine if he were in office, arguing that former President Joe Biden's administration mishandled communications with Russia. \"Biden said the wrong things. Zelensky said the wrong things,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump claimed Russia \"would have been talked out of that war so easy.\"\n\nTrump also said in the interview Friday that French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer \"haven't done anything\" to end the war. Trump is set to meet Macron on Monday and Starmer on Thursday. The meetings come as European leaders are scrambling to respond to Trump's decision to negotiate with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n\nRemember: Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago after months of military buildup and brinkmanship on its side of the border.\n\nMoscow's rhetoric in support of the invasion echoed that of its 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea, which it seized after mass protests in Kyiv forced out a Russia-friendly president. Russia also fomented a separatist rebellion in Ukraine's east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region.\n\nPutin has cast the expansion of NATO toward its borders, and the potential that Ukraine could eventually join the Western military alliance, as an existential threat to Russia.\n\nThe top Democrats on four separate House committees issued an emphatic letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi on Friday seeking information on whether the Justice Department's new policies on corruption investigations will affect investigations into corruption by public officials both within the United States and abroad.\n\n\"Far from rooting out corruption and fraud in our government, as President Trump likes to claim, the Trump administration and DOJ's actions constitute an unprecedented assault on the laws, government agencies and people fighting corruption,\" the letter, which was sent to the Justice Department Friday morning, reads.\n\nIt is signed by Rep. Gerald Connolly of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Summer Lee of the Subcommittee on Federal Law Enforcement, Rep. Jamie Raskin of the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Lucy McBath of the Subcommittee on Crime and Federal Government Surveillance.\n\nSince Inauguration Day, the Justice Department has paused all investigations into corporate foreign bribery, curtailed enforcement of a foreign agent registration law and deemphasized the criminal prosecutions of Russian oligarchs, CNN has reported .\n\nAnd Trump officials have seriously considered eliminating the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, from which at least four prosecutors resigned as part of the fallout to drop the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.\n\nThe four Democrats cited Trump's purging of inspectors general , the department's abandonment of criminal cases against former Rep. Jeffrey Fortenberry and Rep. Andy Ogles, and the Trump's pardon for former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.\n\nThe firings were \"patently illegal,\" the letter says, and dropping the cases \"shielded\" the president's allies from criminal exposure.\n\nThe letter requests all communications around DOJ decision to drop those cases and the Blagojevich conviction; to specify which cases surrounding a US business bribing a foreign official will be prosecuted; and to specify the number of cases brought by the department's Task Force KleptoCapture that involve assets linked to nationals of Russia and China.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.\n\nThis week's Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) was expected to serve as an informal homecoming for those granted clemency in President Donald Trump's near-blanket pardoning of people charged or convicted in connection with the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\n\"The J6ers are here at CPAC,\" Steve Bannon, the former Trump strategist and nationalist populist, said Thursday during his remarks to raucous cheers from attendees.\n\nBut some were initially denied entrance to the conference on Wednesday, including Richard Barnett , whose photograph - feet propped on a desk inside then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office - became one of the most enduring images of the riot.\n\n\"I am considered a national hero,\" Barnett said in a video he posted to social media after he was turned away from CPAC. \"I'm a J6er and I have an unlimited, unconditional presidential pardon from President Trump,\" he continued. \"I went when he called me, I stood up. I spent all this time in prison for my country.\"\n\nStewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers, was also initially denied entry.\n\n\"I have no idea what the rationale is,\" he said in a video posted on social media, \"there's a two-tier system still, on the conservative side too, if you're a disfavored patriot you're purged by the left and you're purged by the right.\"\n\nAs a vocal contingent of Rhodes' and others' supporters began to complain online, CPAC responded Thursday on X, saying that it is \"untrue that we are not allowing people to come to CPAC because of their involvement with J6. In fact, CPAC has been a constant supporter of this persecuted community, and we support wholeheartedly President Trump's pardons of the J6 victims.\"\n\nBarnett, Rhodes, and others returned to the conference on Thursday and this time were granted entry.\n\n\"We're like gods,\" Joe Biggs , a leader of the Proud Boys, who was serving a 17-year sentence for his role in the Capitol, told CNN Thursday when asked how he was received by CPAC attendees.\n\nBut still, others were not so lucky. At least one other person charged with January 6-related crimes was denied entry from the conference on Thursday. It was not clear specifically why, but in a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for CPAC said the conference \"will not tolerate those who only seek to disrupt our great event.\"\n\nThe spokesperson declined to elaborate on the nature of the disruptions.\n\nCNN's Sean Clark contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThe CIA late last week moved to fire more than a dozen officers for working on diversity issues , in what amounts to a deeply unusual round of mass firings at the agency, according to court filings and current and former officials familiar with the effort.\n\nIn a court filing, the government suggested that further dismissals may be imminent, and a current official familiar with the matter confirmed that agency officials are in the process of working on recommendations for further cuts. A final number has not yet been decided, that person said.\n\nSome of the fired officers are now challenging their dismissal in court on the grounds that it violated federal workforce laws, and a federal judge in Virginia is expected to hold a hearing to weigh a temporary restraining order against the move on Monday. Kevin Carroll, a lawyer and former CIA officer, said he represents 21 officers who have been fired.\n\n\"None of these officers' activities was or is illegal, and at no time have the agencies employing Plaintiffs contended that they individually engaged in any misconduct, nor are they accused of poor performance,\" those officers claim in a complaint against CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. \"Plaintiffs are being fired because of their assumed beliefs about a domestic political issue, and losing their property interest in their employment without due process of law.\"\n\nAccording to the filing, the officers were only on temporary assignments working on diversity issues - the agency routinely assigns officers to different roles as part of their career development - and in some cases, they were not working on diversity issues at all.\n\n\"Plaintiffs are not somehow 'DEIA officers,'\" the filing read. \"Plaintiffs are career intelligence officers of different career services who Defendants believe, in some cases inaccurately, now serve in temporary positions related to DEIA.\"\n\nThe CIA declined to comment.\n\nUS special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy \"the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war\" - a sharp contrast from the rhetoric of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"A long and intense day with the senior leadership of Ukraine,\" Kellogg said in a post on X Friday that also shared Zelensky's video message about their meeting Thursday in Kyiv.\n\n\"Extensive and positive discussions with @ZelenskyyUa, the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war and his talented national security team,\" Kellogg said.\n\nHis words of praise for the Ukrainian president are a far cry from those of Trump, who has repeatedly railed against Zelensky and called him a \"dictator.\"\n\nThe Defense Department has temporarily paused a plan to carry out mass firings of civilian probationary employees until Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the Pentagon's Office of General Counsel can carry out a more thorough review of the impacts such firings could have on US military readiness, two defense officials familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nRemember: The pause comes after CNN reported on Wednesday that the mass terminations, which could impact over 50,000 civilian employees across the Pentagon, could run afoul of Title 10 section 129a of the US code . Following that report, Pentagon lawyers began reviewing the legality of the planned terminations more closely, the officials said.\n\nThat law says that the secretary of defense \"may not reduce the civilian workforce programmed full-time equivalent levels unless the Secretary conducts an appropriate analysis\" of how those firings could impact the US military's lethality and readiness. The law also says that mitigating risk to US military readiness takes precedence over cost.\n\nA senior defense official told CNN on Wednesday that such an analysis had not been carried out before military leaders were ordered to make lists of employees to fire.\n\nLeland Dudek, now the acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, acknowledged in a now-deleted LinkedIn post that he had worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency prior to his being elevated to the leadership position.\n\nHe replaced Michelle King, a longtime agency staffer who departed last weekend after tussling with DOGE staffers over access to the agency's sensitive records on millions of Americans. Frank Bisignano , the CEO of Fiserv and President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, is awaiting confirmation by the Senate.\n\nDudek, a career employee who had worked in the agency's anti-fraud office, wrote that he had been cooperating with the DOGE, which resulted in his being placed on administrative leave before the shakeup at the department.\n\n\"I confess. I helped DOGE understand SSA. I mailed myself publically accessible documents and explained them DOGE,\" he wrote in the post, which CNN viewed. \"I confess. I moved contractor money around to add data science resources to my anti-fraud team to examine Direct Deposit Fraud.\"\n\n\"I confess. I bullied agency executives, shared executive contact information, and circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done,\" he posted.\n\nElon Musk, who leads DOGE and incorrectly implied this week that millions of dead people are collecting Social Security benefits, praised Dudek on X on Wednesday.\n\nMore context: DOGE's gaining access to Social Security's data, which contains reams of personal information on hundreds of millions of Americans, has raised red flags among experts and consumer advocates.\n\nDudek sought to allay some concerns on Wednesday, saying in a statement that \"DOGE personnel CANNOT make changes to agency systems, benefit payments, or other information. They only have READ access.\" He also noted that that the DOGE team cannot access data related to a court-ordered temporary restraining order, current or future. He also noted that there are people older than 100 who do not have a date of death associated with their record, but they are not necessarily receiving benefits.\n\nThe Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nOn a night that often amounts to a lot of hurry-up-and-wait between votes, senators found ways to stay entertained as the hours dragged on while the chamber stayed in session overnight for a marathon vote series leading up to a final vote on the Senate GOP budget resolution, the first step to advancing President Trump's sweeping agenda.\n\nAs the Senate kicked off its late-night votes on Thursday, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis grabbed a large bowl of popcorn and walked into the Republican cloakroom.\n\nRepublican Sen. Markwayne Mullin took time between presiding over the floor and casting votes to give a virtual tour of the Capitol to his followers on X, posting dispatches from the Capitol's rotunda and crypt throughout the night.\n\n\"As you heard: we're doing vote-a-rama in the Senate. I don't mind fighting, but for what? The liberals KNOW they won't win,\" he captioned one video of the rotunda. \"Anyway, here's another mini tour.\"\n\nMullin is also the current occupant of the Senate candy desk, and whichever senator is assigned the desk is tasked with keeping it stocked full of treats for their colleagues. However, he noted that he's getting \"a little blowback\" for the green, St. Patrick's Day-themed candy he provided.\n\n\"I think I'm going to have to pivot to Easter,\" he joked.\n\nThe Kremlin appears to be surprised by how quickly US President Donald Trump has made concessions to his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin even before beginning negations to end Moscow's war in Ukraine, a former Russian deputy minister told CNN.\n\nThe Kremlin had expected Trump would make certain demands of Russia and Moscow was \"preparing some sort of offers here and there to make what they call a deal,\" said Vladimir Milov, Russia's former deputy minister of energy and a former adviser to the late Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.\n\nSpeaking in exile in Vilnius, Lithuania, Milov told CNN's Kim Brunhuber that, based on what he's heard, \"everybody in Moscow is totally astonished by now that they were given all the concessions they wanted, even before the negotiations started.\"\n\n\"This is a shocking result, even by Vladimir Putin's standards,\" Milov said.\n\nThe long-fraught relationship between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky tore apart this week.\n\nTrump parroted Moscow's talking points, wrongly accusing Ukraine of starting the war and saying that the Ukrainian president should hold an election that was suspended due to the conflict.\n\nAfter Zelensky hit back, accusing him of being in a \"disinformation space,\" Trump escalated the war of words and called the Ukrainian president a \"dictator.\"\n\nPerhaps emboldened by the falling out between Ukraine and the US, Moscow's demands appear to be accelerating in the past few days, Milov noted, saying \"Moscow is clearly encouraged by Trump's lack of willingness to impose any conditions on Russia.\"\n\nRussia has long claimed that expansion of NATO put its security under threat, necessitating its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. That claim has been dismissed by Western leaders as a bogus justification for launching its war.\n\nOn the campaign trail, President Donald Trump vowed repeatedly that he'd bring prices down \"starting on Day One\" if elected. It's been a month since he took office and he has yet to deliver.\n\nConsumer prices rose 0.5% last month compared to December - the fastest monthly increase in prices since August 2023, according to Consumer Price Index data. And it could soon get even worse with wholesale prices remaining elevated , often a precursor to higher consumer prices.\n\nThe pain is most acute at the grocery store, where consumers are confronting soaring egg prices - if they're lucky enough to come across any eggs - due to avian flu outbreaks nationwide. And despite Trump's promise to \"drill, baby, drill\" to bring gas prices down, Americans are paying four cents more for a gallon of regular fuel on average than when he returned to the White House on January 20, according to AAA data.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Americans aren't pleased. A new CNN poll shows 62% of Americans feel Trump hasn't done enough to tackle inflation. Nearly the same share of Americans view inflation as \"a very big problem,\" according to a Pew Research poll published on Thursday.\n\nRead more about what team Trump's doing about it here.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Friday will begin with him speaking at the Governors Working Session at 11 a.m. ET, according to a news release from the White House.\n\nHe will have lunch with Vice President JD Vance at 1 p.m. and then attend a swearing-in for Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick at 2:30 p.m. in the Oval Office.\n\nHe will sign executive orders at 3:30 p.m.\n\nSenate Republicans took a major step to advance President Donald Trump's sweeping agenda early Friday morning, voting to adopt a budget blueprint that sets up a clash with House Republicans, who have put forward a competing plan.\n\nRemember: The budget resolution is a non-binding blueprint that does not carry the force of law. But the framework needs to be adopted first before Senate Republicans can pass legislation on a party-line vote without the support of Democrats through a process known as reconciliation.\n\nRepublicans are planning to use that mechanism to pass what they hope will be Trump's signature legislative achievements.\n\nHere's what to know about the overnight\"vote-a-rama\":\n\n• Overnight vote seals the deal: The final vote in favor of Trump's agenda came after a rare overnight work session for the Senate that started Thursday evening and wrapped up close to 5 a.m. ET on Friday after lasting just short of 10 hours.\n\n• How many people voted for the agenda? The final tally was 52 to 48, with GOP Sen. Rand Paul joining Democrats to oppose the resolution.\n\n• What was voted through? Senate Republicans have put forward a budget resolution that would bolster funding for immigration enforcement, national security and energy production. In contrast, House Republicans have a more far-reaching plan that would allow them to address tax policy, a critical issue that Senate Republicans want to take up later as part of a second legislative package.\n\nHouse Republicans, with a razor-thin majority, want to address all of the party's major priorities in a single bill in a bid to get everything done at once. Senate Republicans, on the other hand, want the party to score an early win on issues important to voters, like the border, before moving on to address tax policy, a thorny issue that may take longer - and prove more challenging - for the party to thread the needle.\n\nRead more about the Senate's budget blueprint.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Envoy for Hostage Affairs has called on Hamas to release the body of Shiri Bibas and all the remaining hostages held in Gaza or \"face total annihilation\" after Israel said a body that did not match any Israeli hostages had been handed over as part of the ceasefire deal.\n\n\"If I were them, I'd release everybody or they're going to face total annihilation,\" Adam Boehler told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night.\n\nBoehler described the incident as \"a clear violation\" of the deal and expressed disbelief at the revelation calling it \"absolutely stunning.\"\n\n\"I don't know what they thought when they put the body of someone else in a coffin and said that it was the mother of two kids that have been brutally murdered,\" he said, echoing a statement made by Israel earlier in the day that forensic evidence and intelligence suggested the boys were murdered.\n\nHamas said in November 2023 that Kfir and Ariel Bibas were killed along with their mother in an Israeli airstrike. On Friday, the Hamas-controlled Government Media Office in Gaza said Shiri Bibas' body was \"mixed up\" with other bodies under rubble as a result of the airstrike.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Hamas would pay \"the full price\" for its failure to hand over Shiri Bibas' remains.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Trump is vowing to pardon Jan. 6 rioters. Allies and critics alike say he needs a refresher.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - President-elect Donald Trump's recent \"Meet the Press\" interview has triggered concerns among allies and critics about his level of awareness of the details of the sprawling investigation into the Capitol attack that has produced hundreds of convictions in the nearly four years since Jan. 6.\n\nTrump is weeks away from being sworn in, a day he has said that he'll \"most likely\" begin immediately pardoning Jan. 6 defendants. \"I'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes,\" Trump told Time magazine. \"We're going to look at each individual case, and we're going to do it very quickly, and it's going to start in the first hour that I get into office. And a vast majority of them should not be in jail.\"\n\nInterviews with Trump allies, supporters of Jan. 6 defendants, online sleuths who have aided the FBI investigation, and law enforcement officials reveal an unusual level of agreement: Trump's recent comments made clear to them that Trump hasn't kept up to speed on the Jan. 6 docket. More than 1,500 defendants have been charged and 1,100 convicted in the sprawling Capitol breach probe, with more than 600 being sentenced to prison. Defendants were arrested, convicted and sentenced all throughout 2024, but the cases received diminishing coverage.\n\nTrump told NBC News' Kristen Welker that he'll be \"acting very quickly\" on Jan. 6 pardons, saying there might be \"exceptions\" if Jan. 6 defendants were \"radical\" or \"crazy.\" He also appeared to mistakenly believe that most or all Jan. 6 defendants were being held in the jail in Washington, when in fact only a handful of defendants are still being held pretrial and those who have been convicted are now housed in federal prisons across the country. One law enforcement official said the interview made \"absolutely\" clear that Trump wasn't read in on the details of Jan. 6 cases.\n\nA Trump ally who is familiar with the discussions within the Trump team said that the \"Meet the Press\" interview showed the president-elect's blind spots on the sprawling probe.\n\n\"There needs to be a more specific, updated argument made to the public to defend pardons for Jan. 6 defendants,\" the Trump ally said. \"The D.C. jail is only one facet of the imprisonment of a few hundred J6ers who are in jail who have been sentenced.\"\n\n\"Even people familiar with the day-to-day J6 prosecution, it's difficult to keep up with what is happening. But it's very important for the president to have a very succinct and compelling argument for these pardons,\" the Trump ally said.\n\nAnother person with direct knowledge of the Trump transition team's planning said that instead of sweeping pardons for most of the participants, their understanding is that a few defendants were being selected who would be \"very worthy of a pardon,\" but that the process would then continue for a few weeks and months to vet the remainder. Another source familiar with the discussion said that they expect Trump to go big and broad with pardons, but that there were no indications he'd gotten into the details at all yet. The Trump transition team had no comment.\n\nEd Martin , a conservative activist whom Trump recently named as chief of staff at the Office of Management and Budget, has broadly been involved in discussions about Jan. 6 pardons, one Trump ally said. Martin was on the board of the Patriot Freedom Project, an organization that supports Jan. 6 defendants and their families, and which has hosted fundraisers at Trump's properties. Martin was also at the Capitol on Jan. 6, although there's no evidence he entered an area that had been restricted, and he's spread conspiracy theories - including one about a man he's referred to as \"Mr. Coffee\" in the aftermath of the attack. Martin, who stood behind Trump during a fundraiser for Jan. 6 defendants last year, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBill Shipley, an attorney who has represented numerous Jan. 6 clients, said Trump was going to have to \"go wide\" on pardons \"to live up to campaign and post-election statements,\" and said he was \"optimistic\" about the pardon process, even though he'd seen no indication a formal process had been set up yet.\n\n\"It seems to me that the scope of the pardons or commutations that will be forthcoming after Jan. 20 is going to be quite wide,\" Shipley said. \"I've seen no information yet suggesting the mechanism by which those pardons will be processed has been decided upon.\"\n\nAmong the Jan. 6 defendants at issue are rioters who have been identified on tape brandishing or using firearms , stun guns , flagpoles , fire extinguishers , bike racks , batons , a metal whip , office furniture , pepper spray , bear spray , a tomahawk ax , a hatchet , a hockey stick , knuckle gloves , a baseball bat , a massive \"Trump\" billboard , \"Trump\" flags , a pitchfork , pieces of lumber , crutches and even an explosive device during the brutal attack, which injured more than 140 police officers.\n\nSteve Baker, a Jan. 6 defendant who now works as a writer for Glenn Beck's The Blaze and has his sentencing scheduled for after Trump takes office, told NBC News that it was clear to him that Trump was busy building his administration.\n\n\"I'm not being critical at all. What I'm saying is considering all the other things he has on his plate right now ... the one thing that he's not up to speed on is the actual details of these Jan. 6 cases,\" Baker said. \"It's not like everyone is sitting in the D.C. gulag right now. ... It was abundantly clear that he was not aware of the individual cases. He knows bits and pieces of stories, just like most people do.\"\n\nAnother line that prompted worries even among some of Trump's fiercest allies was when he pointed to outdated conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6 attack, invoking the name of Ray Epps, a Trump supporter who was falsely accused of being a federal informant after one of Trump's former White House speechwriters spread that conspiracy theory online.\n\nEpps was the 16th person whose photo was added to the FBI's Capitol violence website in the early days of the chaotic investigation and was quickly identified and then removed from the site. That sparked conspiracy theories that Epps was a federal informant, based on the premise that Epps was accidentally added to the list and then removed. (Many of the conspiracy theories emerged from the crowd on Jan. 6 itself, with members of the mob accusing their fellow Trump supporters of being either undercover federal agents or members of the left-wing group antifa that has engaged in violent protests.)\n\n\"What ever happened to Ray Epps? Now, I don't know anything about Ray Epps, but it was sort of strange the way he was talking,\" Trump said in the interview. \"Where is he? What happened to him?\"\n\nThe answer: Epps is on federal probation. Epps was charged by the Justice Department in 2023 and pleaded guilty to one count of disorderly or disruptive conduct on restricted grounds. Federal prosecutors sought a six-month prison sentence for Epps , which they said was justified because of his efforts to \"inspire and gather a crowd\" to storm the Capitol. A federal judge gave Epps probation , saying Epps had been \"vilified in a matter unique to January 6 defendants\" and was the only Jan. 6 defendant who \"suffered for what you didn't do,\" and that \"prison was not warranted\" given the collateral consequences of the conspiracy theory on Epps' life.\n\nEpps, during his sentencing hearing in January, said that he now realized that the 2020 election \"was not stolen\" and that the violence was \"generated by people like me, who supported President Trump and listened to his lies and the lies of others that the election was stolen.\" Having his fellow conspiracy theorists target him was a wake-up call, Epps said.\n\n\"When Fox News and the Trump cult turned on me and my wife for a convenient shift of blame, it was life-changing, it was a life-changing reality check,\" Epps said during his sentencing hearing. \"My wife and I were forced to look elsewhere for the truth.\"\n\nA Trump ally told NBC News that while \"the Ray Epps thing is titillating to the public,\" it was not a coherent argument about why Trump was going to pardon Jan. 6 defendants. \"Overall, that is not a compelling piece of this very necessary political and public argument that needs to be made,\" the source said.\n\nThat wasn't the only conspiracy theory Trump repeated during the interview.\n\nTrump also said there \"might be some people from antifa\" in the Jan. 6 crowd \"because those people seem to be in good shape.\" Numerous Jan. 6 participants who had been falsely identified as being anti-fascist protesters have, after their arrest, been revealed to have been Trump supporters, although one \"anti-establishment\" activist is currently serving a six-year prison sentence after prosecutors argued he came to \" foment anarchy .\"\n\nTrump also said video evidence was being hidden from the public. \"You have a lot of cameras. They don't want to release the tapes. They don't want to release the tapes,\" Trump said. In fact, the Justice Department has regularly released evidentiary videos from Jan. 6 cases following requests made by a media coalition, and a Republican-led committee has published thousands of hours of CCTV footage from Jan. 6 on the conservative video-sharing website Rumble.\n\nOnline sleuths who have aided the FBI in hundreds of arrests told NBC News that there are currently 90 people on the FBI's Capitol violence website who have been identified and turned in to the FBI but have not yet been arrested. Among them are 59 people whom the FBI has labeled as \"AFO,\" meaning they are wanted for assaulting federal law enforcement, and nine listed as \"AOM,\" or wanted for assaulting the media. A law enforcement source told NBC News last month that investigators would focus on the \" most egregious \" Jan. 6 cases until Trump took office, and seven \"AFOs\" have been arrested since then, along with 10 defendants whose photos were not featured on the FBI website.\n\nOne online sleuth said Trump's comments were \"a rehash of the oldest internet conspiracies,\" but joked that they did agree with Trump that House Republicans should publish more Jan. 6 footage, since some of the most critical video has never been uploaded.\n\nAnother sleuth said there didn't seem to be much internal consistency in Trump's arguments.\n\n\"He's incensed that people who didn't enter the Capitol got arrested. But he also wants to know whatever happened to Epps. And he's promised to pardon everyone who was arrested. Like Epps, who was charged and sentenced and didn't enter the Capitol. But whatever happened to Epps?\" they said. \"It's just like arrrgh .\"\n\nInside the Justice Department, there's a sense of frustration about the pending pardons, but pride about the work that the Capitol Siege Section has done. Even if Trump pardons hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, there's a record of the reality of the attack that cannot be erased.\n\n\"You can't unring the bell of the conviction,\" one federal prosecutor involved in Jan. 6 cases told NBC News. \"No one can take that away.\"\n\nThe source said that prosecutors were determined to do their work until the end, whether that's when a Trump-appointed Justice Department official orders the investigation shut down, or when the five-year statute of limitations expires in 2026.\n\n\"The mood has shifted, but we're far from demoralized,\" they said. \"We're going to ride this train 'til the end of the line, whether that's Jan. 20, 2025, or Jan. 6, 2026.\"\n\nRyan J.

      "text": "Trump storms Washington with hundreds of pardons - and he might not be done\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nDonald Trump granted only one pardon during his first year in office when he last served as president.\n\nNow, just days into his second term, Trump has averaged one pardon for every few minutes he's been back in power.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\nThe pardons and commutations have stood out in Trump's first week back in the White House, even as a flurry of executive orders covering everything from tech policy, diversity initiatives and the federal workforce have blanketed Washington. They have been a way for Trump, with a simple flourish of his pen, to reward groups of people who supported him.\n\n\"There were campaign promises that President Trump made,\" a Trump official said. \"That's what you're seeing now. I'm not sure you'll see rounds of pardons throughout [his term], but what I can say is it was important for him to keep his promises.\"\n\nThe vast majority came during Trump's first day in office, when he surprised even some of his own supporters and aides by pardoning virtually every person charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol - including those convicted of committing acts of violence against law enforcement.\n\nWe're looking to hear from federal government workers. If you're willing to talk with us, please email us at tips@nbcuni.com or contact us through one of these methods.\n\nBut Trump didn't stop there. On Tuesday, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht , a bitcoin pioneer who was sentenced to life in prison for creating and running Silk Road, a black market on the dark web that sold illegal drugs. Ulbricht's cause had been championed by libertarians, and Trump pledged to pardon Ulbricht during his campaign.\n\nThe next day, Trump pardoned two Washington, D.C., police officers who were convicted for their roles in the death of a young man on a moped in 2020.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the president pardoned 23 anti-abortion activists one day prior to the March for Life, an annual anti-abortion demonstration. Their cause was championed by conservative lawmakers who argued that President Joe Biden's administration overreached in its prosecutions.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was one of those advocates. He tweeted Tuesday evening urging the president to quickly pardon the activists. On Thursday, just prior to Trump issuing those pardons, Hawley spoke directly with the president on the matter.\n\n\"When we talked, he was familiar with the general situation already,\" Hawley said. \"It's very fair to say he was up to speed on it. And we had a really good conversation that left me with a very distinct impression that he was going to do what he ultimately did do.\"\n\nHawley said he noted the timing of Friday's March for Life in his pitch to the president on why he should expedite the pardons.\n\n\"I just said, 'Listen, these folks have waited a long time,'\" Hawley said. \"Some of them are quite elderly, and this would be a great thing to do now. He left me then with the distinct impression that he was going to move sooner rather than later, which he did.\"\n\nPresidents rarely use their king-like power of clemency in their first few days in office, typically saving the vast majority of the oft-controversial decisions until the very end of their term. Biden, whose White House touted that he had offered far more measures of clemency than his predecessors for groups of people like nonviolent drug offenders, saved his most controversial pardons for his final weeks in office, including pre-emptive pardons for some of his family members.\n\nDuring his first term , Trump issued only slightly more than two dozen pardons prior to losing the 2020 election. He issued dozens more during his final days in office.\n\n\"He's already broken with past presidents by doing so many in the first 48 hours,\" said Angela McArdle, chair of the Libertarian National Committee, which advocated for Ulbricht's pardon. \"It's incredible. I mean, he has set a new precedent.\"\n\nTrump allies say not to expect a similar pardon spree in the coming weeks. But several others see an opportunity and want to promote their cause before a president who proclaimed \"I love freeing people,\" as McArdle recalled him saying in a conversation at Mar-a-Lago in December 2023.\n\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. plans to seek a meeting with Trump to deliver a list of proposed pardons compiled by various organizations, including the Congressional Black Caucus, former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. - one of the people his father wants Trump to pardon - said in an interview with NBC News on Friday.\n\nThe younger Jackson, who served time for misappropriating campaign funds for personal use, sought a pardon from President Joe Biden but did not get one. Jackson suggested that if Trump meets with his father, it could be the 83-year-old civil rights leader's final visit to the White House.\n\n\"While Rev. Jackson strongly disagrees with the pardon granted by the president on Jan. 6 [offenses], Rev. Jackson acknowledges that ... the president has an absolute right to pardon whom he chooses,\" the former congressman said. \"And Joe Biden had an absolute right to pardon only his family. And he had an absolute right to ignore everybody else.\"\n\nBiden was expected to grant pardons to at least several former elected officials after fellow Democrats had lobbied him to take such action, according to a person with direct knowledge of the effort.\n\nAmong them were former members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Jackson, this person said. The Biden allies who pushed for them to receive clemency were stunned when he didn't grant it before leaving office; some of them viewed his inaction as selfish, given Biden made sure to issue pre-emptive pardons for members of his family minutes before Trump was sworn in as his successor.\n\nMeanwhile, one lawyer who represented several clients seeking clemency from Biden said part of their calculus was that being rejected by Biden could make their cases more appealing to Trump.\n\nFormer Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., is also among those seeking clemency from Trump through unofficial channels. Menendez has used allies to get his case in front of the president to ask for a sentence commutation or pardon, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Menendez sought and failed to obtain a pardon from Biden before he left office.\n\nMenendez has been advised to ask Trump directly for clemency before his sentencing that's scheduled for Wednesday, according to one person familiar with his efforts. The crux of the former senator's argument would be that he has been politically targeted by the Justice Department like Trump believes he was, this person said.\n\nMenendez pleaded not guilty to federal corruption but was convicted in July. He resigned from the Senate in August and is facing potentially years in prison. Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, faces similar charges and has pleaded not guilty. Even before Trump won the November election, the former senator told people close to him that he may have a better chance of getting a pardon from him, NBC News has reported , given his contentious relationship with Biden and his position that his prosecution was political.\n\nAt the same time, Menendez joined all Senate Democrats in voting to convict Trump during his two impeachment trials. He has reviewed Trump's clemency in 2020 for former Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois, who was serving a 14-year prison sentence after he was convicted on federal corruption charges, to help inform his efforts to receive one from the president as well, NBC News has reported.\n\nAdvocates know to appeal to Trump's disdain for federal law enforcement, particularly after he was charged in multiple jurisdictions during Biden's time in office. When announcing his pardon of Ulbricht, Trump wrote on social media : \"The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me.\"\n\nTrump was first turned on to Ulbricht's case amid an effort to court libertarian support, as McArdle laid out, saying that Ric Grenell, who was recently tapped as one of Trump's special envoys, reached out to start a dialogue on how Trump could win this demographic.\n\nDuring her meeting at Mar-a-Lago, McArdle said that pledging to free Ulbricht from prison \"would make a big impact.\" He ultimately promised to do so at last year's Libertarian Party convention .\n\n\"I even talked with his staff ... right after the inauguration, and they assured me that the president was going to deliver on his promise,\" McArdle said. \"And sure enough, it was like 36 hours after he'd been sworn in.\"\n\nGrenell and the White House did not return a request for comment.\n\nMcArdle suggested another pardon that may be on the horizon: Roger Ver, a former California resident and bitcoin investor facing charges of fraud and tax evasion. Trump ally and confidant Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has taken up Ver's cause .\n\nThere is a formal process for receiving a presidential pardon as laid out by the Justice Department . It involves submitting a petition through the Office of the Pardon Attorney, which then reviews the case before determining whether to elevate it to the president. But that process is not always followed.\n\nHawley, however, said his sense is that \"there's a fleet of lawyers who are working on\" the pardon cases that get before the president.\n\n\"I imagine his team of lawyers has spent a lot of the last two and a half months since his election working on these different things,\" he said. \"I mean, to draft an executive order, you don't just do that in 10 minutes. You've got to be very, very careful.\"\n\nA senior Senate GOP aide said that in his first few days, Trump \"kind of hit everyone\" he needed to with his offers of clemency, and it remains to be seen if there will be more.\n\n\"He got the pro-lifers,\" this person said. \"They got the libertarians their guy. They got the J6ers their guys. I don't know if there's anyone left really who's a priority. But who knows.\"\n\nAllan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.\n\nJonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News.\n\nCarol E.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, adding that she is thinking about the hundreds of police officers who defended the Capitol that day. \"And I do fear the message that is sent to these great men and women that stood by us.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJennifer Jett\n\nTrump's suspension of U.S. refugee resettlement is a \"step backward\" for the United States, the International Rescue Committee said today.\n\n\"America has a proud tradition of welcoming those who are persecuted or otherwise in danger,\" David Miliband, the New York-based group's president and chief executive, said in a statement. \"The refugee resettlement program is a proven, orderly, cost-effective way of offering life-saving protection to some of the most vulnerable people in the world.\"\n\nThe group urged the White House to grant case-by-case exemptions permitted by the executive order that Trump signed yesterday and to carry out a prompt, evidence-based assessment so the program may be resumed.\n\nThe suspension could affect tens of thousands of extensively vetted refugees around the world, including Afghans who supported the U nited States in its war against the Taliban and who have been waiting for resettlement since U.S.-led forces withdrew in 2021.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nCaroline Kenny\n\nThe Trump administration is ordering all federal employees in diversity, equity and inclusion roles be placed on paid leave by tomorrow evening, according to a new memo from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nThe memo issued today to heads of departments and agencies sets a deadline of no later than 5 p.m. ET tomorrow to inform the employees that they will be put on paid administrative leave as the agencies prepare to close all DEI-related offices and programs and to remove all websites and social media accounts for such offices.\n\nTrump signed an executive order yesterday ending \"radical and wasteful\" diversity, equity and inclusion programs in federal agencies, with DEI offices and programs being ordered to shut down.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJanelle Griffith\n\nRyan J. Reilly\n\nAfter his win in the presidential election, Trump told Time magazine that he was still considering pardoning his supporters who were involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, but he was particularly eyeing those who were charged with \"non-violent\" crimes.\n\n\"I'm going to do case-by-case, and if they were non-violent , I think they've been greatly punished,\" he said.\n\nInstead, on his first day in office, Trump went far broader, issuing pardons for most of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes in the Jan. 6 attack. His actions have paved the way for the releases of numerous people found guilty of violent attacks.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nTrump signed an executive order tonight taking aim at hiring practices at the Federal Aviation Administration a day after he issued a flurry of orders that included going after federal diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nThe order signed tonight would rescind DEI initiatives \"in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating employees on the basis of individual capability, competence, achievement, and dedication.\"\n\nThe order cited part of the FAA website that sought to recruit pilots with disabilities and claimed that DEI initiatives penalized \"hard-working Americans who want to serve in the FAA but are unable to do so, as they lack a requisite disability or skin color.\"\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nA woman who destroyed a window at the Capitol with an ice ax and a giant cardboard tube was released from the D.C. Jail today. Rachel Powell - known in Jan. 6 circles as \"Pink hat lady\" or \"Bullhorn lady\" - was among the handful of people who have been released from the jail after Trump pardoned them last night.\n\nHer message to Trump: \"Thank you, 'cause he's put my family back together again. Without him, I wouldn't be out right now.\" Her message to her family: \"I'll be home soon.\"\n\nPowell, who received a personalized hat from Trump last year, used a bullhorn to instruct rioters how to \"take\" the Capitol, urging them to \"coordinate together if you're going to take the building.\" She also destroyed a window at the Capitol with an ice axe she took to the Capitol, along with a large cardboard tube.\n\nFederal prosecutors called Powell a \"leading participant in the most violent insurrection to occur at the U.S. Capitol in over 200 years\" during her trial. She was sentenced to more than four years in prison and served just over a year.\n\nBerkeley Lovelace Jr.\n\nAs Trump's health care agenda for a second term takes shape , it's becoming clear that many Biden-era policies won't make the cut.\n\nYesterday, Trump signed a sweeping order aimed in part at reversing several Biden administration executive orders on health care, including efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs for people on Medicare and Medicaid, enhancing the Affordable Care Act and increasing protections for Medicaid enrollees. The so-called initial rescissions order, according to the Trump White House, is aimed at Biden policies that it says are \"deeply unpopular\" and \"radical.\"\n\nThe moves, experts say, are likely to be inconsequential to many people in terms of what they pay in out-of-pocket health care costs.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJennifer Jett\n\nTrump said he was considering imposing a 10% tariff on Chinese goods imports over China's role in the international flow of precursor chemicals for the deadly opioid fentanyl, a move likely to increase trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies.\n\n\"We're talking about a tariff of 10% on China based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada,\" from where it enters the United States, he told reporters at the White House after he made an announcement about AI investment.\n\nHe said that the tariff would probably start Feb. 1 and that the European Union was also \"going to be in for tariffs.\"\n\nTrump said yesterday that 25% tariffs could be levied against Canada and Mexico over fentanyl and border security as soon as Feb. 1. But he did not mention China, which he said during his campaign could be subject to tariffs of 60% or more. After his election in November, he threatened an additional 10% tariff on China over fentanyl.\n\nIn an executive order signed yesterday, Trump instructed federal agencies to review \"unfair trade practices\" by other countries as part of an effort to reduce U.S. trade deficits, suggesting that tariffs would not immediately go into effect after he threatened to impose them on the first day of his presidency.\n\nJake Traylor\n\nBen Kamisar\n\nBridget Bowman\n\nTrump followed through today on several actions he pledged to take on his first day in office , but he still has some major items left on the to-do list he made for himself during the presidential campaign.\n\nTrump signed 46 executive orders and presidential actions on his first day back in the White House aimed at a variety of policy priorities he promised to address on Day One, such as border security, energy, production, transgender rights and pardoning the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters.\n\nA few big issues Trump promised to address were not among those actions, including tariffs and ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nTrump said on Truth Social tonight that he had spoken by phone with the mother of Ross Ulbricht , a Bitcoin pioneer who was sentenced to life in prison in connection with creating a dark web black market, to let her know he had pardoned her son.\n\n\"I just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,\" Trump wrote . \"The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me.\"\n\nThe post was deleted and reposted with Ulbricht's last name spelled correctly.\n\nTrump said l a st year a t the Libertarian National Convention that he would commute Ulbricht's life sentence for crimes related to creating Silk Road, a market where users could buy and sell drugs, fake identity documents and other illegal products.\n\nLora Kolodny, CNBC\n\nTrump said today that he'd consider the possibility of Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's or Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison 's purchasing TikTok.\n\nAt a briefing to announce a joint venture for investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure, a reporter asked Trump whether he was open to \"Elon buying TikTok.\"\n\n\"I would be if he wanted to buy it, yes,\" Trump responded. \"I'd like Larry to buy it, too.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nDaniel Arkin\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nAn estimated 24.6 million viewers watched Trump's inauguration yesterday, Nielsen announced.\n\nThat compares with the nearly 31 million who watched his first inauguration, in 2017, and the 33.8 million viewers for Biden's 2021 inauguration.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, about 17.4 million viewers ages 55 and older tuned in, making them the biggest demographic to watch yesterday's events. About 4.6 million viewers were ages 35 to 54, and fewer than 1.5 million were ages 18 to 34.\n\nRatings peaked when Trump took the oath of office around noon, Nielsen said.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nKate Santaliz\n\nIt appears Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., jumped the gun today when he said he expected the full Senate to reach a bipartisan consensus confirming John Ratcliffe as Trump's CIA director.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., objected to moving that quickly, citing \"serious concerns\" about Ratcliffe's \"ability to distance himself from the political interests of President Trump.\"\n\nAs a result, Thune made a procedural motion setting up Ratcliffe's confirmation vote for Thursday.\n\nThune is expected to procedurally get the ball rolling on Pete Hegseth's and Kristi Noem's nominations, as well - but a lack of agreement about a time for the votes could force them into the weekend. Hegseth is Trump's pick for defense secretary, while Noem is his choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\"I hope nobody's making any plans for the weekend or the evenings, because we're going to get these nominees confirmed,\" Senate Republican Conference Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said, adding that Ratcliffe, Hegseth and Noem would be confirmed \"the easy way or the hard way.\"\n\n\"We tried to cooperate with Democrats. The cooperation has not been forthcoming. So I guess it's going to be the hard way, starting on Thursday,\" Cotton said.\n\nMichael Kosnar\n\nZoë Richards\n\nAll of the FBI websites about the investigation into the Jan. 6 riot, including details of the probe such as video and stills of arrested people, as well as the outstanding suspects featured in the \"seeking information\" section, have been taken down.\n\nThere is now no trace of the probe, which was the largest in the FBIs history, on its website or on FBI field office websites.\n\nAn FBI spokesperson said the websites \"are no longer active.\" Asked for comment, the FBI wouldn't say why they were taken down or who ordered the move.\n\nAs of several weeks ago when the Justice Department put out its monthly summary of Jan. 6 prosecution statistics, 80 unidentified people were still featured on the FBI's Jan. 6 webpage.\n\nNow when a visitor navigates to variations of the site, such as Violence at the United States Capitol, US Capitol Violence and Capitol Violence Images, the visitor is redirected to a content page for featured investigations and news releases but nothing about the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nLinks are still available to summaries of the prosecutions, Jan. 6 anniversary news releases and former FBI Director Christopher Wray's testimony before Congress.\n\nDoha Madani\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., criticized Trump for his inauguration speech yesterday, saying he ignored \"virtually every important issue facing working families.\"\n\nIn a video posted to social media accounts today, Sanders said Trump failed to address solutions regarding health care, homelessness, prescription drug prices, wealth inequality and climate change.\n\nSanders urged people to stay focused on putting pressure on Congress to \"do the right things,\" noting that Republicans have only a slim majority in the House.\n\n\"We cannot panic,\" he said. \"No matter how many executive orders he signs, no matter how many absurd statements he makes, our goal remains the same. We have got to educate. We have got to organize.\"\n\nKen Dilanian\n\nRyan J. Reilly\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nOn the first anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot, then-Attorney General Merrick Garland tried to convey the enormous scope of the law enforcement effort to bring the rioters to justice, calling it \"one of the largest, most complex and most resource-intensive investigations in our history.\"\n\nWith the stroke of a pen , Trump turned that effort to dust yesterday with a blanket pardon of virtually every federal Jan. 6 defendant, save a few who still got their prison terms commuted.\n\n\"I don't think that's OK,\" Jason Manning, who spent years as a line prosecutor working on Jan. 6 cases in Washington, said in an exclusive interview. \"I find the pardons appalling.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nTrump said today that he read a letter Biden left him in the drawer of the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, calling it \"a little bit of an inspirational-type letter.\"\n\n\"It was a very nice letter,\" said Trump, who had reached into the desk while he was answering reporters' questions last night to find the letter, which had \"47\" written on the front.\n\n\"I could show it because I think it was a nice,\" Trump said, adding that Biden urged him to \"do a good job\" and spoke about \"how important the job is.\"\n\n\"I think it was a nice letter. I think I should let people see it, because it was a positive for him in writing it.\" Trump said. \"I appreciated the letter.\"\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nTrump told reporters that recess appointments came up in his talks with congressional Republicans today, adding that he doesn't think they'll be needed.\n\nHe made the remark in response to a question at a news conference at the White House after he announced plans for AI investment in the U.S.\n\nRecess appointments would allow Trump to appoint senior administration officials, bypassing Senate confirmation. During the race for Senate majority leader last month, Trump demanded that candidates allow him to make recess appointments. In 2020, Trump threatened to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments. He did not follow through.\n\nAdam Wollner is a deputy politics editor\n\nRepublicans John Husted of Ohio and Ashley Moody of Florida were sworn into the Senate this evening by Vance.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Husted, formerly the state's lieutenant governor, to replace Vance, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis selected Moody, formerly the state's attorney general, to fill the seat vacated by newly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nWith Husted and Moody officially members of the Senate, Republicans have a 53-47 majority in the chamber.\n\nKatherine Doyle\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nTrump today defended the pardons and commutations of roughly 1,500 defendants charged with crimes connected to the Jan. 6 attack , including some convicted of assaulting police officers.\n\nIn one of the first presidential acts of his second term, Trump commuted the sentences of 14 prisoners and pardoned all others convicted of offenses related to the 2021 riot. He also directed the attorney general to dismiss all indictments pending before judges related to what became the largest federal investigation ever.\n\n\"They've served years in jail,\" Trump said in response to questions from reporters at the White House about why he pardoned violent offenders. \"They should not have served, and they've served years in jail. And murderers don't even go to jail in this country.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nTrump, taking questions from reporters, was asked why he removed his former national security adviser John Bolton's security detail.\n\n\"Because that was enough time,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We're not going to have security on people for the rest of their lives. Why should we? I thought he was a very dumb person, but I used him well,\" Trump added.\n\nEarlier today, Bolton said on X that Trump had removed his security detail, saying he was \" disappointed but not surprised .\" Bolton had had a security detail since 2022, after the Justice Department filed criminal charges against an Iranian Revolutionary Guard official, alleging the official attempted to hire a hitman to kill him.\n\nTrump is joined by Larry Ellison, Masayoshi Son and Sam Altman to announce a new American company that will invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure.\n\nChar Adams\n\nWhen an incoming White House official announced Trump's executive order dismantling federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the official invoked a familiar line:\n\n\"This order is meant to return to the promise and the hope that was captured by civil rights champions, that one day all Americans can be treated on the basis of their character, not by the color of their skin.\"\n\nThe statement echoed a well-known quote from Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech, in which King declared, \"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJo Yurcaba\n\nThe State Department appears to have removed a page from its website titled \" Selecting your gender marker \" a day after Trump issued two executive orders that will have broad effects for transgender people.\n\nAs recently as this morning, the page said that people applying for or updating a passport could select male (M), female (F), unspecified or another gender identity (X) as the gender marker on their U.S. passport books and cards.\n\n\"The gender marker you select does not need to match the gender on your citizenship evidence or photo ID,\" the page said, adding that applicants did not need to provide medical documentation to change their gender markers.\n\n\"We promote the freedom, dignity, and equality of all people - including LGBTQI+ individuals,\" the page said. \"We are demonstrating this commitment to better serve all U.S. citizens, regardless of gender identity.\"\n\nIt also provided information about traveling as an LGBTQ person and cautioned that those with \"X\" gender markers might not be able to travel to all countries.\n\nAs of this afternoon, the page redirects to a general passport information page .\n\nIn an executive order issued yesterday, Trump declared that the federal government will recognize only two sexes - male and female - and that \"these sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.\"\n\nThe order directed the secretaries of state and homeland security to \"implement changes to require that government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards, accurately reflect the holder's sex,\" as defined by the order.\n\nIt will reverse a policy the Biden administration rolled out that allowed transgender people to change the gender on their passports without providing proof of their transitions. The Biden administration also rolled out an \"X\" gender marker for people who are intersex or identify as neither male nor female.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said she is inviting all of the Jan. 6 defendants at the D.C. Jail on a guided tour of the Capitol when they are released.\n\nBoebert made her remarks to reporters after she visited the jail this afternoon. About 20 Jan. 6 defendants remain behind bars almost 24 hours after Trump pardoned them.\n\nJulia Ainsley\n\nZoë Richards\n\nThe Trump administration fired four top officials late yesterday at the Justice Department's Executive Office of Immigration Review, which oversees U.S. immigration courts.\n\nAll four were civil servants, not political appointees: chief immigration judge Sheila McNulty; the office's acting director, Mary Cheng; general counsel Jill Anderson; and policy head Lauren Alder Reid.\n\nReid said in a statement that she and her colleagues were \"shocked and severely disappointed in the decision to remove us from our positions without notice or cause.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n\"Mr. Trump, f--- off!\" said Anders Vistisen, a Danish member of the European Parliament, rejecting the idea that Greenland could ever be for sale. He was then rebuked for using profane language in a parliamentary session.\n\nAnnemarie Bonner\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC, former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn criticized Trump's pardoning of criminal defendants for their actions on Jan. 6.\n\n\"I don't want to say 'I told you so.' I don't want accolades. I don't want to be called a hero. I don't want to need a pardon. I just wanted accountability, and that is gone. It's gone,\" he said.\n\nDunn retired after 15 years with the Capitol Police after the Jan. 6 riot and later launched an unsuccessful bid for the Senate. Former President Joe Biden yesterday gave a pre-emptive pardon to Dunn, who has been outspoken about the actions of the pro-Trump mob that attacked the Capitol in 2021.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nJulie Tsirkin\n\nSydney Carruth Sydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said allegations against Pete Hegseth made by his former sister-in-law are another sign that he's a poor pick to lead the Pentagon.\n\n\"These allegations are extremely troubling,\" Schumer told NBC News. \"It's just more and more and more showing that this man is, of all the people they could have picked from a defense secretary, he's one of the last they should have chosen.\"\n\nS enators received an affidavit from Danielle Hegseth that alleges that Hegseth's behavior caused his second wife to fear for her safety. Hegseth has denied the allegations.\n\n\"I hope all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle read it before making any final judgment, because it is extremely troubling. And it just, you know, the allegations keep coming and coming and coming,\" Schumer said. \"They don't seem to stop\"\n\n\"I hope everyone would feel obligated to read this report,\" Schumer said, saying that \"our own safety and safety of millions of men and women in the armed forces are at stake.\"\n\nSchumer added that the new report makes him concerned that more allegations about Hegseth's behavior toward women could come to light after he is confirmed.\n\nLora Kolodny, CNBC\n\nThe Simon Wiesenthal Center - a Jewish human rights organization named for the writer and Holocaust survivor - called for Musk to apologize over his repeated use of a straight-armed salute at yesterday's Trump inauguration event.\n\n\"We have spent 47 years investigating, pursuing, and educating the world about the dangers of normalizing symbols and rhetoric tied to the Nazi regime,\" the group said. \"We are deeply alarmed by Mr. Musk's gesture at President Trump's inauguration, which unmistakably resembles a Nazi salute. The gesture's undeniable similarity to such a hateful and historically loaded symbol is unacceptable, particularly given the celebratory response it has elicited from Nazi-aligned groups online.\"\n\nRegardless of intent, such gestures can \"embolden extremists, distort history, and undermine efforts to combat the resurgence of far-right ideologies,\" they wrote.\n\nThe center said that, especially given Musk's new responsibilities with the U.S. government, he should \"take swift and decisive action\" to clarify whether he has been misinterpreted and to apologize for the gesture in any case.\n\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment about the salute. In a post on X yesterday he downplayed criticism of it.\n\nJulia Ainsley\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has reinstated Trump's \"Remain in Mexico\" policy after last night's executive order blitz.\n\nThe policy allows officials to prevent migrants of all nationalities from entering the United States from Mexico until their asylum applications are processed. Mexico has said the United States made this decision unilaterally, not as part of an agreement with Mexico.\n\nFrom 2019 until Biden suspended the program, more than 68,000 people were taken back to Mexico. Tent cities surfaced on the Mexican side of the border, and human rights groups said hundreds of asylum-seekers were kidnapped, raped, tortured or assaulted.\n\nThe policy, along with Trump's orders on birthright citizenship, are among those that are likely to get legal pushback from courts. The Supreme Court never ruled on \"Remain in Mexico\" during Trump's first term, but it did issue a decision in 2022 allowing Biden to undo it .\n\nAnnemarie Bonner\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., criticized Trump for pardoning violent offenders for their actions on Jan. 6, 2021, saying she has \"always sided\" with law enforcement.\n\n\"Each president has the prerogative to be able to pardon those individuals. I may not always agree with all of it,\" she said in a CNN interview. \"Some of those protesters, or some who were just walking through the Capitol, were treated very unfairly. But the people who assaulted our police officers do need to pay the consequence for that.\"\n\nSydney Carruth Sydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nSome members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus have arrived at the D.C. jail to greet crowds of pardon supporters and some recently released inmates after Trump issued sweeping pardons for crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe D.C. jail, once the site of protests over the imprisonment of people charged with Jan. 6-related crimes, has become a place of celebration over the last 12 hours as inmates have been released. Nearly two dozen supporters of Jan. 6 prisoners, some of them parents and friends of the inmates, have gathered outside the jail today anticipating further releases.\n\n\"They were prisoners. They're hostages now,\" said Ben Pollack, the father of two men who were arrested and is unhappy with the speed of the releases. \"They're free men.\"\n\nAmong the Freedom Caucus members standing with the crowd are Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., who earlier today announced he is considering a gubernatorial bid in Arizona, and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas.\n\nLaura Strickler\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced that it is rescinding the restrictions that kept Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from conducting arrests in \"sensitive locations\" such as schools, churches or day care centers, even during weddings or funerals.\n\nNBC News had previously reported that the Trump administration intended to rescind the policy.\n\n\"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement announcing the move.\n\nThe policy originally preventing agents from making arrests in sensitive locations started in 2011, and continued under the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nVictoria Ebner\n\nZoë Richards\n\nMichael Fanone , a former police officer who defended the Capitol when it was attacked on Jan. 6, 2021, told NBC News today that he began the process of seeking protective orders against the five individuals who assaulted him that day.\n\nFanone said he made the decision to pursue the orders after speaking with Justice Department representatives who told him there would be no other protections from the individuals who harmed him or have threatened his family.\n\n\"I think that the anticipation was that these individuals would serve these lengthy sentences that they were given for the violent assault that they carried out against me, and now they're free,\" Fanone said. \"And so my thoughts are on protecting myself and members of my family, and nothing else right now.\"\n\nAs Jan. 6 defendants are released following Trump's blanket pardon last night,  Fanone urged others who have worked as police officers to follow in his footsteps by starting the same process of obtaining orders.\n\nFanone said his family is \"disillusioned\" following Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't feel as though we can depend on law enforcement in this country to protect us, because it's no longer the Department of Justice. It's Donald Trump's Department of Justice,\" Fanone said.\n\nSince he testified before Congress, Fanone said, he's been a target - but so has his family, including his 76-year-old mother, who lives alone and has had bricks thrown against her house and even a bag of feces dumped on her while she was raking the leaves.\n\nAnnemarie Bonner\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nKate Santaliz\n\nScott Wong\n\nKatie Taylor\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, criticized Trump's pardon of Jan. 6 defendants, saying those who have committed violent crimes should not have been pardoned. She also noted that she has been in contact with one officer, whom she did not name, who shared a video of his own assault.\n\n\"The police officer involved contacted me today because he's so, understandably, distraught. I don't disagree with him at all. People who committed violent crimes on Jan. 6 of 2021 should not be pardoned,\" she said. \"I would make a distinction between those individuals who do not deserve pardons versus those who may deserve clemency, because they were just caught up in the moment.\"\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also expressed dissatisfaction with the president's action, saying she's \"disappointed\" and fears \"the message that is sent to these brave men and women who stood by us.\"\n\nMatt Lavietes\n\nTara Prindiville\n\nThe bishop leading Tuesday's official inaugural prayer service urged President Donald Trump to \"have mercy\" on his constituents, specifically naming LGBTQ people and immigrants.\n\nBishop Mariann Edgar Budde's sermon was part of a larger post-Inauguration Day interfaith ceremony at Washington National Cathedral. Trump was seated in the first row alongside first lady Melania Trump, Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance during the service, a tradition undertaken by presidents of both parties.\n\n\"In the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now,\" said Budde, who was looking directly at the president. \"There are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families. Some who fear for their lives.\"\n\nShe added: \"They may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. They pay taxes and are good neighbors. They are faithful members of our churches and mosques, synagogues.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAnnemarie Bonner\n\nIn a brief statement, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., criticized Trump's pardon, asking, \"What happened to backing the Blue?\"\n\n\"House Republicans are celebrating pardons issued to a bloodthirsty mob that violently assaulted police officers on January 6, 2021. What happened to backing the Blue? Far right extremists have become the party of lawlessness and disorder. Don't ever lecture America again. About anything,\" Jeffries said.\n\nPeter Alexander\n\nKyla Guilfoil\n\nFormer Trump national security adviser John Bolton said he was \"disappointed but not surprised\" by the president's decision to remove his previously assigned Secret Service detail and pull his security clearance in an executive order signed yesterday. Bolton served as Trump's national security adviser during his first term but later became a vocal critic of the president.\n\n\"I am disappointed but not surprised that President Trump has decided to terminate the protection previously provided by the United States Secret Service,\" Bolton wrote in a post on X .\n\nBolton had maintained a protective detail after the Department of Justice filed criminal charges against an IRGC official in 2022 for attempting to hire a hit man to target him.\n\n\"Notwithstanding my criticisms of President Biden's national-security policies, he nonetheless made the decision to extend that protection to me in 2021,\" Bolton said.\n\n\"The Justice Department filed criminal charges against an Iranian Revolutionary Guard official in 2022 for attempting to hire a hit man to target me,\" Bolton continued. \"That threat remains today, as also demonstrated by the recent arrest of someone trying to arrange for President Trump's own assassination. The American people can judge for themselves which President made the right call.\"\n\nAnnemarie Bonner\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain, R-Mich., said GOP lawmakers are looking to package the extension of Trump's tax cuts and border and energy provisions into one sweeping bill that they will try to advance in April, but added that the legislative strategy is still under discussion.\n\n\"I don't want to get ahead of the president, but right now it looks like we're doing one big bill, or one big beautiful bill,\" McClain said, echoing the remarks of Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., last week. \"At the end of the day, I think what matters most is the results. Right now, we're pursuing one bill, but those are things that we're going to be talking about when we meet today.\"\n\nJohnson said last week that House Republicans would try to pass the legislation by April, an ambitious goal given the party's slim majority. But House members to his right and some GOP senators have expressed skepticism that, under the circumstances, such a broad package could be passed in one massive bill.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans are meeting with Trump at the White House this afternoon to discuss his legislative agenda.\n\nBridget Bowman\n\nGarrett Haake\n\nRep.

Homan declined to confirm that ICE \"raids\" would begin today, instead calling the actions \"targeted enforcement operations.\"\n\nHoman did not directly respond to NBC News when asked whether the actions had already been planned and would have taken place regardless of who took office on Monday.\n\nJulie Tsirkin\n\nSarah Fitzpatrick\n\nCourtney Kube\n\nSenators received an affidavit today from the former sister-in-law of defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth, in which she says his behavior caused his second wife to fear for her safety. The receipt of the affidavit comes after Senate Armed Services Committee staffers were in contact with her for several days.\n\nThe former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, submitted the affidavit in response to a Jan. 18 letter from Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., seeking \"a statement attesting to your personal knowledge about Mr. Hegseth's fitness to occupy this important position.\"\n\nDanielle describes in the affidavit allegations of volatile and threatening conduct by Hegseth that made his second wife, Samantha Hegseth, fear for her safety.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJulia Jester\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nFormer Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., Trump's pick to serve as veterans affairs secretary, said at his confirmation hearing this morning that he plans to review a Biden-era policy that has provided veterans with access to abortion care and counseling, including in states with abortion restrictions.\n\nIn response to a question from Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., about whether a veteran who lives in Texas, where a strict abortion ban is in place, should be able to have the procedure at her local VA if she is raped and becomes pregnant, Collins said: \"That is an issue that is very sensitive in this body. It is something that has been looked at.\"\n\nCollins said the law in its original form from 1992 stated, \"The VA does not do abortions.\"\n\n\"Two years ago, that was a decision that was looked at and decided,\" he said, referring to the Biden administration's policy. \"I will tell you this, we will be looking at that issue when I get in there to confirm that the VA is actually following the law.\"\n\nAsked by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, if he would rescind the interim final rule enacted by the Biden administration on abortion, Collins said, \"Senator, as we just discussed this just a moment ago. The VA Act in 1992 specifically forbid the VA from doing abortions.\"\n\nPressed again whether he would rescind the rule, he said: \"We will look at this rule and see if it complies with the law. As you just said in your own answer, it is a debatable issue. We're going to look at it and make sure that the VA is following the law.\"\n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration began providing access to abortions if the life or health of the mother would be endangered by carrying the pregnancy to term or if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.\n\nThe Biden administration finalized the rule last year, making it the federal government's official policy.\n\nIsabella Ramirez Isabella Ramirez is a politics intern with NBC News.\n\nJacob Chansley, a U.S. Capitol rioter better known as \"QAnon shaman,\" wrote last night on an X post , in all caps, \"Now I am gonna buy me some motha f---ing guns!!!\" after receiving a pardon from Trump.\n\n\"I just got the news from my lawyer ... I got a pardon baby! Thank you President Trump!!!\" Chansley wrote, also in caps. \"J6ers are getting released & justice has come... everything done in the dark will come to light!\" he continued.\n\nTrump issued roughly 1,500 pardons yesterday in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, including for people who assaulted law enforcement officers.\n\nIn November 2021, Chansley was sentenced to 41 months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of felony obstruction of an official proceeding. Federal prosecutors had described Chansley as the \"public face of the Capitol riot.\"\n\nNBC News' Christine Romans looks at an overview of the economy President Trump is inheriting heading into his second term, and offers an outline of his new agenda.\n\nDaniel Barnes is reporting from the federal courthouse.\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nA federal judge today barred the Justice Department from sharing former special counsel Jack Smith's final report on the classified documents case against Donald Trump with members of Congress.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon , a Trump appointee, found there was no urgent need for the Justice Department to share the report with the chair and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees while an appeal involving Trump's co-defendants in the case is still pending.\n\nThen-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said earlier this month he would not make the report public until the appeals involving Trump co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira were decided, but planned to share it with the committee heads for a private review \"upon your request and agreement not to release any information\" about the report publicly.\n\nIn her ruling , Cannon said there had not been such a request, and suggested that the members of Congress could not be trusted not to share the contents of the report publicly.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nLawrence Hurley\n\nA coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit today in Massachusetts seeking to block President Donald Trump 's attempt to revoke the right to automatic birthright citizenship.\n\nTrump yesterday signed an executive order that purports to limit birthright citizenship to people who have at least one parent who is a United States citizen or a permanent resident.\n\nThe proposal faces an uphill battle and strong opposition not just from the 19 Democratic attorneys general, including officials from New Jersey, California, New York, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia, but also civil rights groups, which have already filed their own lawsuit.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAbigail Williams\n\nIn his first message to the U.S. diplomatic corps, Secretary of State Marco Rubio pledged to restore the department as the primary agency leading U.S. foreign policy, but warned that achieving this will require change.\n\n\"Certain priorities will be replaced, certain issues de-emphasized, and some practices we will cease altogether,\" Rubio said in the departmentwide letter obtained by NBC News. He said, \"Trump was elected with a clear mandate for sweeping change, in foreign no less than in domestic affairs.\"\n\nAmong those priorities will be \"securing America's borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants,\" the secretary wrote. \"Mass migration is among the most consequential issues of our time. The era of mass migration must end.\"\n\nThe State Department under Rubio will also follow Trump's executive order to eliminate diversity initiatives \"in both letter and spirit,\" Rubio said. \"There is tremendous talent and expertise in this Department - I have seen it firsthand in missions across the globe - and upholding strict meritocracy is essential to securing our nation's future,\" said Rubio, who is the first Latino U.S. secretary of state.\n\nRubio also said that, \"while we will not ignore threats to our natural environment,\" the State Department would prioritize energy dominance, instead of the climate policies of the past two decades, which he said had \"weakened America.\"\n\nTrump's top U.S. diplomat also said the State Department must stop \"pushing political and cultural causes that are divisive at home and deeply unpopular abroad,\" saying \"these counterproductive activities, too, must and will end.\"\n\nRubio closed by saying, \"This will not be my mission - it must be OUR mission,\" praising both U.S. diplomat's talents as well as their commitment to service and emphasizing, \"There is no agency of government I would rather lead than this one, and no team of public servants I would rather work with than you.\"\n\nBenjamin Deeter\n\nWRC, NBC's affiliate in Washington, D.C., spoke briefly with Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers militia, outside the D.C. Central Detention Facility, a day after Rhodes was released from prison. Rhodes was sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2023 after being convicted of seditious conspiracy, evidence tampering and obstructing an official proceeding for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump commuted Rhodes' sentence to time served as part of a sweeping set of roughly 1,500 pardons in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, including those who assaulted police officers. He was released from prison hours after the pardons were announced, his attorneys said.\n\nOther members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, another militia involved in the attack, had their sentences commuted. Former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was released from custody last night, his family said in a statement.\n\nRhodes told WRC that Trump \"did the right thing\" in pardoning the Jan. 6 defendants, calling the day \"a good day for America.\"\n\nKate Santaliz\n\nAnnemarie Bonner\n\nRyan J. Reilly\n\nThom Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters that he \"can't agree\" with Trump's decision to pardon the Jan. 6 rioters and that he was \"surprised\" it was a blanket pardon. Tillis said he plans to introduce two bills that will increase the penalties for those charged with assaulting or murdering police officers.\n\n\"That should give you everything you need to know about my position,\" he said.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said that the pardons were \"justified\" but that he doesn't want pardons for violent offenders. When reporters followed up that violent offenders did receive pardons, Johnson said, \"I haven't seen the details, but I think a lot of those crimes are definitely well deserved.\"\n\nSeveral Republicans brushed off the pardons, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who told NBC he's \"looking forward to the next four years, not the last four\" when pressed on Trump's decision.\n\nAsked what message this sends to officers who were attacked that day, Thune said, \"Would you guys ask the same questions of Biden?\"\n\nIt is not clear how many of those pardoned are violent offenders, but Trump offered a blanket pardon to roughly 1,500 criminal defendants who were charged.\n\nMany of those who are in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons were convicted of violent attacks on police officers protecting the Capitol during an assault in which Jan. 6 defendants were armed with items such as firearms and stun guns.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized Trump today for his actions and pardons in his first day in office.\n\n\"On Day 1 into his presidency, it's clear Donald Trump's golden age is not for the working and middle class,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"His golden age, rather, is for the special interests, for the wealthy elite and the corporate insiders he promised to take on as president.\"\n\nSchumer also criticized Trump for pardoning the people convicted of assaulting Capitol police officers, saying: \"And sadly, it's a golden age for lawlessness and lawbreakers who were pardoned yesterday by President Trump. There's no other way to describe President Trump's pardon of Jan. 6 offenders than un-American.\"\n\n\"It's a betrayal of the highest order of our Capitol police officers who risked their lives to keep us safe,\" Schumer said.\n\nAli Vitali\n\nRep. Jonathan Jackson, a Democrat who represents parts of Chicago, said Tuesday that his community was bracing for potential ICE raids in the opening days of the Trump administration and that he's \"very much concerned.\"\n\n\"I hate to see the level of fear that [Trump is] putting into society,\" Jackson said on MSNBC's \"Way Too Early\" when asked about NBC's reporting that Chicago could be among the cities that see action on mass deportation at the outset of the new administration.\n\n\"We all agree there should be a strong border. We all believe that people should obey laws. We also believe that there should be a path towards reconciliation, towards citizenship ... towards restoration,\" he said. \"But this sort of meanness, divisiveness, and from what President Trump says, is one thing. But people are going to act out on the law and on the ground is going to be something totally different.\"\n\nJackson also talked about watching Trump's swearing-in and remarks in the rotunda yesterday, calling them \"dystopic,\" \"morose\" and \"a bit dark.\"\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune says he expects the full Senate to vote this afternoon on the nomination of John Ratcliffe to be the next CIA director.\n\nThune also said that they plan to file cloture on a couple more of Trump's nominees later today, which would start the process of confirming them later this week, although he did not say which nominees.\n\nIn the Senate, if there are any objections to quickly voting on a nominee, the majority leader must file cloture to bypass a filibuster of the nominee. That starts a process that takes a couple of days to complete. If Thune filed cloture on nominees today, it would set up confirmation votes on Thursday.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked Stefanik about hand gestures that Trump adviser Elon Musk made at the president's rally yesterday afternoon, which many people described as Nazi salutes.\n\n\"What do you think of Elon Musk, perhaps the president's most visible adviser, doing two Heil Hitler salutes last night at the president's televised rally?\" Murphy said.\n\n\"No, Elon Musk did not do those salutes,\" Stefanik responded. \"I was not at the rally, but I can tell you, I've been at many rallies with Elon Musk, who loves to cheer when President Trump says we need to send our U.S. space program to Mars. Elon Musk is a visionary. I'm looking forward to his work in DOGE, the department of government efficiency, and look forward to looking how we can be more efficient and effective. But that is simply not the case. And to say so is - the American people are smart. They see through it. They support Elon Musk.\"\n\nMurphy then shared comments from far-right and Christian nationalist leaders describing Musk's hand gestures as a Nazi salute. Musk pounded his chest and then lifted his arm above his head, twice, during remarks at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I could keep going,\" Murphy said. \"Over and over last night, white supremacist groups and neo-Nazi groups in this country rallied around that visual. Does it concern you that those elements of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist element in the United States believe that what they saw last night was a neo-Nazi salute?\"\n\nStefanik said, \"What concerns me is this is what you, the questions you believe are most important to ask to the U.N. ambassador, I have a very strong record when it comes to combating antisemitism.\"\n\nMusk did not respond to NBC News' request for comment but he has publicly denied that he was making a Nazi salute.\n\nLast night, he thanked the Anti-Defamation League, which put out a statement defending Musk as having made \"an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute.\"\n\n\"Frankly, they need better dirty tricks,\" he wrote on X. \"The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"\n\nAdam Reiss\n\nKyla Guilfoil\n\nNew York City police officers received a notice from their department Saturday reminding them not to take part in or interfere with federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\n\"Members of the service are not permitted to engage in civil immigration enforcement,\" the order said. It went on to say \"members of the service will not take any action that will interfere with or impede civil immigration enforcement taken by federal authorities.\"\n\nThe departmentwide order came just days before Trump's inauguration. The president has pledged to begin m ass deportation s on \"Day 1\" of his term.\n\nUnlike Democratic leaders in some other states, NYC Mayor Eric Adams has said he is ready to work with Trump on his initiatives . The mayor also had a meeting with Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, in December, saying, \"His goal is the same goal I have.\"\n\nCourtney Kube\n\nA Coast Guard notification to the force dated today reports that acting Secretary of Homeland Security Benjamine Huffman relieved Adm. Linda Fagan of her duties as commandant of the Coast Guard.\n\nThe notice - known as an ALCOAST - does not specify why she was relieved.\n\nAdm. Kevin Lunday is now the acting commandant.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, asked Stefanik how she would use her role at the United Nations to address and deter Russia's war with Ukraine.\n\n\"My effort will be supporting President Trump's mission to bring that to a resolution, and to deter Russia in the long term,\" Stefanik said.\n\nStefanik said she has a \"strong record when it comes to deterring Russia, pushing back on Russia, including during President Trump's term, voting for defensive lethal aid to Ukraine.\"\n\n\"I believe peace through strength is our strongest deterrence, and I'm very proud that during President Trump's first term, it was the only president where Putin did not invade another country because of that strong peace-through-strength leadership,\" she said.\n\nAsked how she would hold Russia accountable, Stefanik said she will work with the White House National Security Council and Trump's Cabinet \"to use this position at the United Nations to support his strategy, and give him maximum flexibility to bring this to a resolution.\"\n\nErik Ortiz\n\nColette Peters, director of the federal Bureau of Prisons, has stepped down after a two-and-a-half year tenure, the agency said. Her deputy director, William Lothrop, has been named acting director.\n\nIn a statement shared today with BOP employees, Lothrop, a 30-year veteran of the bureau, acknowledged \"ongoing challenges, including staffing shortages and operational issues ,\" but said he is \"committed to working alongside you to find real solutions that strengthen our facilities.\"\n\nPeters, an agency outsider who previously led Oregon's prison system, took over in Auguest 2022 as accusations of cronyism and corruption, widespread staffing shortages, and violence and misconduct in prisons continued to roil the bureau.\n\nAmong her last actions was the closing and consolidation of BOP facilities, including a prison in Dublin, California, at the center of inmate sexual abuse .\n\nWhomever the Trump administration's incoming attorney general appoints as BOP director will manage a massive $8 billion-plus budget, more than 142,850 federal inmates across 122 prisons, and a workforce of more than 35,000 as the Justice Department's largest employer.\n\nBenjamin Deeter\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee has favorably reported the nomination of Scott Bessent to be treasury secretary.\n\nThe vote was 16-11 in favor, with Democratic Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire joining all committee Republicans in supporting Bessent.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nRyan J. Reilly\n\nThe family of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died after responding to the Jan. 6 attack, called the pardons of those responsible for the attack, including the ones who assaulted officers, an \"undoing of justice.\"\n\nThe family, in a statement, referred to the pardons as \"the undoing of the justice that was previously determined by the Court's sentencing of Brian's assailants\" adding, \"It is our hope that the truth of what happened that tragic day will survive, irrespective of partisan political objectives.\"\n\nJulia Jester\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said during his opening statement during Collins' confirmation hearing that he's \"incredibly disheartened that the Trump administration is canceling the flights of nearly 1,660 Afghan refugees who were already cleared by the U.S. government to resettle in the United States.\"\n\n\"These allies aided our troops in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"The risks to these Afghan allies are so dire and dangerous, and many of our veterans groups have been advocates for them, as you know. In fact, the strongest advocates for resettling those at-risk Afghan allies are the veterans who benefited from their protection and their service.\"\n\nBlumenthal continued, \"Our nation has a sacred promise that we've made to do right by the men and women who risk their lives for our freedoms and democracy and do right for their families, and that includes those translators, the guards, the others that put their backs in targets and became our loyal friends.\"\n\nTrump signed an executive order addressing birthright citizenship on his first day in office, a constitutionally protected right. NBC News' Danny Cevallos reports on how the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution on birthright citizenship has been legally scrutinized.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nThe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee will hold a confirmation hearing at 10 a.m. today for Doug Collins to be secretary of veterans affairs.\n\nCollins, a former House member from Georgia and a Navy veteran, was a staunch defender of Trump during his first impeachment investigation, during which Collins served as the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nCollins is not expected to face a difficult path to confirmation but is likely to be pressed today on potential cuts he would make to the department, his views on private medical care for veterans and certain health care policies like the Biden administration's rule that allows the VA to provide abortions to veterans.\n\nAnnemarie Bonner\n\nMarco Rubio has been sworn in as secretary of state. Vice President JD Vance swore him in and gave him the oath of office. The two of them served in the Senate together.\n\n\"Everything we do must be justified by the answer to one of three questions: Does it make us stronger? Does it make us safer, and does it make us more prosperous? If it doesn't do one of those three things, we will not do it,\" Rubio said.\n\nRyan J. Reilly\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nThe dismissals of Jan. 6-related cases are underway as incarcerated Jan. 6 rioters are set to be released from jail and prison following Trump's pardons and commutations.\n\nAt least 17 dismissal motions have been filed so far and they are signed by Edward Martin, the Jan. 6 defendant advocate who is now acting U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C.\n\nSome people were released last night and releases are going to continue.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nAt 10 a.m., the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a confirmation hearing for Rep. Elise Stefanik's nomination to be Trump's U.N. ambassador.\n\nStefanik has been an ardent ally of Israel's military operations in Gaza, and a strong ally of Trump's after first being elected as a moderate Republican in 2015.\n\nAides expect this hearing to run around three hours.\n\nBarring a major stumble in her confirmation hearing, Stefanik is expected to be eventually confirmed by the Senate, and Republicans had hoped to schedule her confirmation hearing last week but background check paperwork was delayed (like it is for many others).\n\nAlexander Smith\n\nLONDON - In a freewheeling Inauguration Day of speeches, casual remarks and formal balls, Trump wasted no time trying to shape the world in his unmistakable image .\n\nUnlike four years ago, when his term began in a flurry of unpreparedness, this time Trump let fly with a series of actions and statements that seek to scrub out many of former President Joe Biden's decisions and replace them with his own stark imprimatur.\n\nFrom tariffs, TikTok and the Middle East to the climate crisis and world health, here are the headlines of Trump's foreign policy moves during the first 24 hours of a term set to last 1,461 days - and how the world reacted.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nEarly this morning, Trump said on his Truth Social account that he's firing José Andrés from the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, and former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley from the National Infrastructure Advisory Council.\n\nHe also dismissed former U.S. special representative to Iran, Brian Hook, from the Wilson Center for Scholars and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms from the President's Export Council.\n\n\"You're fired!\" he wrote in all caps.\n\nBiden yesterday issued a pre-emptive pardon for Milley, a retired general, after Trump had made threatening remarks about him.\n\nAndrés responded on X by saying that he had already submitted his resignation last week and that his two-year term was already up.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nNewly confirmed Secretary of State Marco Rubio refused to comment this morning on Trump's pardons of 1,500 Jan. 6 rioters despite saying after the 2021 attack on the Capitol that it was \"one of the saddest days in American history.\"\n\nIn an interview on NBC's \"TODAY\" show, he was asked what message the pardons send to the rest of the world, but deflected the question as outside his foreign policy purview.\n\n\"We're going to focus on what makes America stronger and more prosperous and safer,\" Rubio said. \"I'm not going to engage in domestic political debates. I can't in the role of State Department. My job is to focus on the president's foreign policy.\"\n\nPressed again to react to the pardons, he said, \"My days at least in the time I'm at Department of State, my engaging in domestic politics will be put aside as I focus on the affairs of the United States has around the world.\"\n\nRubio said he's going to be working on foreign policy issues and criticized host Craig Melvin for asking questions about domestic politics.\n\nAfter the Jan. 6 riot, Rubio put the attack in foreign policy terms. \"Today, America looks like the countries that they came here to get away from. Vladimir Putin loved everything that happened today, because what happened is better than anything he could have ever come up with to make us look like we're falling apart,\" he said.\"\n\nLawrence Hurley\n\nTrump's plan to roll back the constitutionally protected right to birthright citizenship is just one of several contentious executive actions that are likely to face pushback from judges and could be struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\nOther policies that could be legally vulnerable include a plan to invoke an 18th century law called the Alien Enemies Act to round up and deport certain immigrants, legal experts said. Efforts to reallocate congressional funding to build a border wall and refusing to spend money appropriated by Congress for environmental policies would also most likely be challenged.\n\nCivil rights groups and Democratic attorneys general are likely to sue over a number of Trump policies. In fact, lawsuits were filed challenging Trump's proposed Department of Government Efficiency within minutes of his taking the oath of office.\n\nBut not all lawsuits are created equal, and many will fail.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nKate Santaliz\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nToday, the Senate will be holding confirmation hearings for Elise Stefanik to serve as ambassador to the United Nations and Doug Collins as secretary of veterans affairs.\n\nBoth hearings take place before the Senate Foreign Relations and Veterans' Affairs Committees at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to hold a markup at 10:15 a.m. of Scott Bessent's nomination for treasury secretary. His confirmation hearing took place last week.\n\nTara Prindiville\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nTrump is expected to hold a news conference at the White House later today to make an infrastructure-related announcement, his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\n\"I won't get ahead of President Trump, but I can ensure you, assure you, that it's going to be a massive announcement, and it's going to prove that the world knows that America is back,\" she said.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nRepublican House and Senate leaders are expected to meet with Trump today, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters yesterday.\n\nThe meeting will be at the White House in the afternoon, a congressional leadership source familiar with the meeting told NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Jan 6. inmates from Georgia await pardon, release from jail: 'We're going home, boys!'\n\n\"A pardon to me, would be vindication of all that I have endured over the last four years,\" Dominic Box, a 34-year-old inmate housed at the D.C. jail, told USA TODAY. \"It's proof that President Trump has our back just like we had his back on Jan. 6 and every day since he came down that golden escalator.\"\n\nBox , a former car salesman from Savannah, is one of 35 people with Georgia ties who have been criminally charged in a Jan. 6 case.\n\nWhile many were handed down relatively light sentences like fines, probation, and home confinement, other rioters - known colloquially as \"J6ers\" - are serving significant prison time. Box is currently detained in the notorious D.C. jail , located just two miles from the Capitol building.\n\nTrump has repeatedly pledged to free \"most\" of the J6 inmates, saying in a recent interview with Time Magazine that he'll begin granting pardons \"in the first hour\" of his presidency. Though Trump has been vague about which individuals will receive a pardon, Box takes him at his word.\n\n\"I am expecting a pardon and believe every J6er deserves a pardon, whether they were violent or nonviolent,\" Box said, pointing to unfair treatment he believes Jan. 6 offenders faced in court.\n\nHe insisted that the \"Patriot Pod\" of the D.C. jail isn't full of \"Nick Fuentes and Richard Spencer types,\" but rather \"normal people\" who had their lives uprooted following the events at the Capitol.\n\nThese are some of the Georgians who could be pardoned in a matter of weeks.\n\nMichael Bradley of Forsyth is the latest Georgian to be sentenced for his role in the riot. A federal judge in D.C. gave him a five-year prison sentence on Dec. 17, the longest of any Georgian charged for the attack.\n\nThe 50-year-old mechanic was charged with assaulting police with a dangerous weapon, civil disorder, and impeding arrest - all felonies - as well as several misdemeanors.\n\nIn court documents, prosecutors described how Bradley entered Capitol grounds with a metal baton holstered to his hip. He swung the baton at a line of officers multiple times in the Lower West Terrace Tunnel, the site of some of the most violent attacks against law enforcement that day.\n\nBradley's court-appointed attorney unsuccessfully tried to delay the sentencing, writing last month that it was \"likely, if not certain\" that the Department of Justice's policy toward Jan. 6 defendants \"will change markedly\" after Trump takes office again.\n\nU.S. Senior District Judge Reggie B. Walton, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, didn't accept that reasoning.\n\n\"Speculation about what the future President might do once he takes office cannot trump what the legislature commands a judicial officer must do following a criminal conviction,\" Walton responded.\n\nHours after Jack Wade Whitton, a 33-year-old man from Locust Grove, participated in the riot on Jan. 6, he texted a photograph of his bloodied hands to a friend and declared, \"This is from a bad cop... I fed him to the people.\" He then said he didn't know or care about the officer's status.\n\nWhitton was referring to an officer whom, according to the Department of Justice , he had grabbed and dragged \"head-first and face-down into the violent, angry mob of rioters.\" The officer was then beaten with a baton and flagpole.\n\nCourt documents allege that Whitton also repeatedly punched officers and struck them with makeshift weapons including a metal crutch. At one point, he kicked at their riot shields, screaming at an officer, \"You're gonna die tonight!\"\n\nThe Georgia business owner was arrested in April 2021 and pleaded guilty to assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers with a deadly or dangerous weapon. He was sentenced to nearly five years in prison in May 2024, but received credit for the three years he's served since his arrest.\n\n\"I tell you with confidence: I have changed,\" Whitton reportedly said to the judge during his sentencing.\n\nCertain individuals stood out among the crowd of thousands that day. One of them came to be known as \" Zip Tie Guy .\"\n\nThe man in question stole zip ties from a Capitol closet, strapped them to his belt, and entered the Senate gallery intending to \"take senators hostage,\" court documents read .\n\nIn the weeks that followed, online sleuths spent hours pouring over images and footage of Zip Tie Guy, who appeared to be aided by another woman.\n\nProsecutors eventually learned the pair's identities: Eric Munchel of Nashville, Tennessee and his mother, 59-year-old Lisa Eisenhart of Woodstock, Georgia.\n\nProsecutors say that Eisenhart wore a tactical vest to the Capitol and encouraged others to fight with the police. Eisenhart was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for obstruction and conspiracy charges. Her son was sentenced to five years.\n\nAs a self-described \"citizen journalist,\" Box livestreamed his march to the Capitol and showed viewers his time inside the building. After abandoning a plea deal, Box's misdemeanors were upgraded to felony obstruction and civil disorder charges. In total, he faces a maximum sentence of 13 years.\n\nBox is the only Jan. 6 defendant without violent charges being held at the D.C. jail, where he's been detained for 15 months. This has afforded him certain privileges. He has a paid position in the jail and is one of two certified barbers on the unit.\n\nHe was also the only man with a working radio on election night. As the evening wore on, Box called out the results to the other inmates from his cell.\n\nWhen it was clear that Trump had defeated Vice President Kamala Harris, Box's cries echoed throughout the jail block: \"We did it! Trump won! We're going home, boys!\"\n\nBut will Trump stay true to his word? Box and the other J6ers will have to wait to see if they do, indeed, get to go home.\n\nMelissa Cruz is an elections reporting fellow who focuses on voter access issues for the USA TODAY Network.

This week, the one who was currently in prison is heading home.\n\nTrump's action triggered the release of prisoners found guilty of attacking police officers as well as far-right extremist group leaders, and hundreds who did not engage in violence but interrupted Congress' certification of former President Joe Biden's electoral victory in 2020, activated by unfounded claims that the election had been stolen . January 6 led to the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history and saw the conviction of about 1,270 people in the last four years, 1,100 of whom had been sentenced by the time of Trump's pardons, USA Today reported . Over 700 were sentenced to some amount of time in jail."

Friedrich rejected the request and kept Smith, 48, scheduled for sentencing three days before Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration for his second term in office.\n\nSmith could be sentenced to up to 10 years behind bars for his part in damaging an 1850s mahogany door in the Capitol's Senate wing, estimated to cost about $21,000 to replace.\n\nSome judges have recently delayed cases involving other Jan. 6 defendants such as Jake Lang , a New Yorker who tweeted a New Year's Day message that \"2025 will be forever ... known as the year GOD SET FREE the J6ers.\"\n\nWhether Jan. 6 rioters will be pardoned wholesale is one of countless unknowns about the second Trump presidency, and Smith attorney Kevin A. Tate's delay request acknowledged that \"certainly there is no guarantee Mr. Smith will be pardoned.\"\n\nIf pardons come, these Northeast Florida Northeast Florida residents might get out of prison early:\n\n∎ Anthony L. Sargent , 48, of St. Augustine, was sentenced to five years behind bars in December 2023 for a felony conviction of civil disorder and a series of misdemeanor charges.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said Sargent grabbed and pushed a police officer who tried to detain a rioter; shoved two officers away from the Capitol while they tried to retreat; and twice threw \"a heavy object\" at Capitol doors police were standing behind, urging others to do the same.\n\nThe agency said that before the riot, Sargent stated his support for a riot and for civil war on a messaging platform of the right-wing Proud Boys extremist group.\n\nSargent is at Federal Correctional Institution Jesup in South Georgia, scheduled for release in February 2028, according to a federal Bureau of Prisons website .\n\n∎ Daniel Paul Gray , 44, of Jacksonville, is also at Jesup, serving a 30-month sentence for struggling with a female police officer during the riot. Gray, who is scheduled for release in February 2026, told a judge before his sentencing he had \"no one to blame but myself for my actions.\"\n\nBlanket pardons could also relieve strain on these people awaiting trial for riot-related charges:\n\n∎ Garth Walton , 33, was arrested in Nassau County in July and is awaiting trial on charges including assaulting, resisting or impeding officers and obstructing law enforcement during a civil disorder as well as several misdemeanors.\n\n∎ Palatka resident Dylan Swinehart , 24, was charged in August with four misdemeanors involving entering a restricted building and disorderly or disruptive conduct. He has pleaded not guilty and his charges are still hanging over him.\n\nPeople who've already served time behind bars might also feel some benefit (maybe limited) if a pardon removed some restrictions that still control how they live their lives.\n\nFor example, Macclenny resident Bradley Weeks served a 10-month sentence for charges including the felony of obstructing an official proceeding before the U.S. Supreme Court decided that charge shouldn't have been applied to some riot defendants. He was resentenced to the time he had already served, but until February is still under home detention with and location monitoring as part of a \"supervised release\" that followed his time locked up.  That meant that when Weeks, a photographer, was hired for a photo shoot in North Georgia, his lawyers had to ask a judge last month to approve a special order allowing him to travel farther than his release normally allows.\n\nAt least 11 people from Jacksonville and nearby counties were charged in connection to the riot, but some have already completed sentences and might not be affected by pardons."

      "text": "Criminal case dismissed against last Oklahoman still accused of Jan. 6, 2021, crime\n\nA judge on Monday dismissed the last criminal case against an Oklahoman accused of being inside the U.S. Capitol illegally on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nU.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, however, refused to dismiss the misdemeanor charge against Darrin Bradley \"with prejudice.\" The decision means Bradley, 53, of Anadarko, could be charged again in federal court in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Finally,\" Bradley said Monday. \"It took a little while. ... I knew I didn't do anything wrong.\"\n\nThe judge criticized President Donald Trump, saying the dismissal \"does not erase the well-documented attempt by certain individuals to overturn our democratic process on January 6, 2021.\"\n\n\"The record of proceedings of the prosecutions of those who sought to prevent the peaceful transfer of power are available in the records of this courthouse for those who seek the truth,\" the judge wrote in the dismissal order.\n\nOn his first day back in office, Trump directed prosecutors to seek dismissals with prejudice of all pending charges over conduct at or near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nTrump also commuted the sentences of 14 felons and pardoned all others convicted of offenses at or near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\" This proclamation ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation,\" Trump wrote.\n\nIn his order Monday, the judge wrote he was joining others in fundamentally disagreeing with that justification for a dismissal. \"There was no 'grave national injustice' in the prosecutions and convictions of individuals for their conduct on January 6,\" Sullivan wrote.\n\nAlmost 1,600 people were charged in federal court in Washington, D.C., with crimes during the investigation of the Capitol riot. Thirteen were Oklahomans at the time.\n\nThousands marched on the Capitol on Jan. 6. 2021, after Trump spoke at a rally and urged them to fight like hell. Trump at the rally repeated his claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.\n\nRioters overwhelmed Capitol police and stormed the building, delaying the formal counting of the Electoral College votes that had Joe Biden winning the 2020 presidential election. Bradley wrote on Facebook Messenger that he was one of the first few hundred to get inside.\n\nBradley went in through the Parliamentarian doors at 2:45 p.m., a few minutes after rioters breached that entrance, the FBI reported. He left seven minutes later.\n\nThe U.S. Army veteran was charged in August with four misdemeanors.\n\nThe evidence against him included Capitol security camera recordings, his own photos and videos, and conversations on Facebook Messenger.\n\n\"Civil War 2. ... I'll happily die for OUR USA,\" Bradley wrote in one Jan. 5, 2021, conversation, according to the FBI.\n\n\"They're afraid of Patriots,\" he wrote in a Jan. 8, 2021, conversation, according to the FBI. \"It NEEDS to get BAD!!! It NEEDS to get REAL!!!\"\n\nIn August, the Trump supporter told The Oklahoman, \"I didn't break nothing. I didn't assault nobody. I didn't do anything.\"\n\nHe contended Antifa activists posing as Trump supporters were to blame for the violence. He told the FBI he spoke with police inside the Capitol and helped an elderly man get out, according to an affidavit.\n\nAlso having to wait for days to have her case dismissed was Leslie Bogue, 67, of Marlow.\n\nBogue and a friend, Trina Reyes, went into the Capitol through the East Rotunda doors at 2:40 p.m., the FBI reported. They left 18 minutes later.\n\nPolice had been \"actively resisting\" the protesters at the doors, and Bogue and Reyes looked on as one officer was pulled to the ground, the FBI reported.\n\nBoth were charged in May with four misdemeanor offenses. U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan dismissed the case against Bogue and Reyes with prejudice on Jan. 27.\n\nReyes lives in Texas and is the former mayor of a San Antonio suburb. The two met up in the Dallas area and traveled to Washington, D.C., together.\n\nReyes told the FBI that she and Bogue took photos inside the Rotunda, according to a court affidavit. Reyes said they left after seeing people vandalizing paintings and putting MAGA hats on top of statues.\n\nBogue told FBI agents in 2022 she did not go inside the Capitol, according to the affidavit. She admitted in 2024 in a second interview that she did go in the building.\n\nAfter being charged, Bogue told a Lawton television station, KSWO, that she went to Washington, D.C., to support Trump and did nothing wrong.\n\n\"I'm a patriotic American. I love my country,\" she said in May.\n\nCriminals charges against two other Oklahomans were dismissed with prejudice the same week as Trump's proclamation.\n\nBenjamen Scott Burlew , 45, of Miami, Oklahoma, was awaiting sentencing on a felony charge for assaulting a police officer outside the Capitol. He had been in custody more than eight months after missing a court appearance. He was freed Jan. 20.\n\nMatthew Titus Allen , 44, of Castle, was awaiting sentencing on two misdemeanor offenses for his conduct inside the Capitol.\n\nStill hoping to get her misdemeanor case dismissed is Dova Alina Winegeart , 51, of Fairview, even though she was pardoned. She is appealing her conviction for attempted destruction of government property.\n\nHer attorney, William Shipley, said the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has been sending cases back to judges to vacate convictions and grant dismissals. \"So rather than settle for having a pardon with a conviction still on her record, we expect to have the entire case dismissed,\" the Hawaii-based defense attorney said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols sentenced Winegeart in December to four months in prison for twice swinging a pole at an outside Capitol door. She had not reported to prison at the time of her pardon. She now no longer has to serve the sentence.\n\nWinegeart has called for restitution \"for J6ers.\"\n\n\"They wanted to break us,\" she wrote about the Justice Department in a social media post last week. \"I was on the edge so many times believing my family would be better off without me because we were being harassed and threatened nonstop. Our own government did this to us!\"\n\nSeven other Oklahomans convicted of misdemeanor offenses also were pardoned. They are Andrew Craig Ericson , 27, of Muskogee; Danielle Nicole Doyle , 40, of Oklahoma City; Anthony Alfred Griffith Sr. , 60, of Fort Gibson; Tanner Bryce Sells , 29, of Chandler; Edward T. Spain Jr. , 59, of Chelsea; Levi Roy Gable , 39, of Chouteau, and Tricia Monique LaCount , 55, of Tulsa.\n\nOne Oklahoman convicted of a felony was pardoned. Jerry Edward Ryals , 30, of Fort Gibson, was given nine months in prison after pleading guilty to civil disorder. \"This will forever be a mark that can never be washed away,\" he said at his 2022 sentencing."

      "text": "Arizonans pardoned by Trump for Jan. 6 Capitol attack respond by thanking God and buying guns\n\nAs people convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol learned of their pardons from President Donald Trump, those with Arizona ties professed their gratitude, and one ― who became an icon of the incident ― announced plans to purchase weapons.\n\nJake Angeli, whose fur hat with horns and his chest of shamanistic tattoos made him a visual shorthand of the attack, wrote on X on Monday night that his lawyer had just told him about the pardon.\n\n\"Now I am gonna buy some (expletive) guns!!!\" he posted.\n\nTrump, capping his first day in office, issued blanket pardons for all but a handful of those convicted of crimes related to the attack on the Capitol. Trump supporters stormed the building, sending members of Congress fleeing for safety . The official certification of the 2020 election of President Joe Biden over Trump was delayed for hours.\n\nArizona Attorney General Kris Mayes criticized the pardons during a news conference on Tuesday, calling them the \"most anti-law enforcement action that any president of the United States has ever taken.\"\n\nMayes said she could not officially do anything about the pardons and commutations other than denounce them. She said the public shouldn't forget the events of that day, including the officers who were injured trying to protect lawmakers.\n\n\"I find it deeply appalling, disgusting and offensive to every law enforcement officer in this country and in the state of Arizona,\" Mayes said.\n\nBesides the pardons, Trump also commuted the sentences of 14 people. That preserved their convictions but allowed for their release from prison.\n\nAmong those was Edward Vallejo, 66, who was found guilty by a jury of seditious conspiracy in January 2023 . The Bureau of Prisons website showed him still in custody on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nTim Gionet, known online as \"Baked Alaska,\" also celebrated his pardon. Gionet, who used to live in Arizona, pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor count of parading or demonstrating in the Capitol building.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone who has always supported me over the years,\" Gionet wrote Monday night. \"It's a bit emotional for me knowing 1,500 patriots were just freed. My probation is terminated. God is so good.\"\n\nRyan Zink, who went to the Capitol with his father, Jeff Zink , and who has failed in his bids to win a seat in Congress from Phoenix, posted on social media thanking God for the pardon of his jury conviction.\n\n\"Praise the Lord in everything,\" Ryan Zink wrote. \"I have my rights back. Praise him in the storm. Onto full restoration and recovery for all J6 defendants.\"\n\nRyan Zink, who failed in his own bid for Congress out of Texas, posted Tuesday that he drove a released \"J6er\" home.\n\nThe pardons and commutations have the effect of dismissing extensive law enforcement work to find people who were pictured on video.\n\nSome defendants from Arizona were arrested after tips to the FBI. Someone who knew Nathan Wayne Entrekin of Cottonwood tipped off the FBI after seeing video of him at the riot dressed as Captain Moroni, a figure from the Book of Mormon .\n\nAnother man, Jacob Zerkle of Bowie, was arrested after the FBI sought the public's help in identifying him. Zerkle was partly identified because of his unique beard, styled into two distinct mutton chops extending past his face.\n\nAnother man, James Burton McGrew, was found after video showed him lifting his shirt at the U.S. Capitol to ward off tear gas. On his stomach was a distinctive tattoo that read \"King James\" in an old English font . Investigators partly verified his identity by finding a years-old booking photo that showed the same tattoo. Authorities arrested McGrew in Arizona where, according to court records, he was planning to move in with a relative.\n\nVallejo, the man convicted of seditious conspiracy and still listed as in custody, was arrested in January 2022 following an investigation that spanned more than seven months. Vallejo was tried before a jury alongside members of the Oath Keepers extremist group.\n\nOne of the leaders of that group, Stewart Rhodes, was sentenced to 18 years in prison. But he was listed in Trump's executive order, along with Vallejo, as among those whose sentences were shortened.\n\nAngeli was quickly the subject of news stories by The Arizona Republic and other outlets identifying him following the attack. Angeli already was a fixture in that outfit ― fur hat with horns, shirtless with a tattooed torso, painted face ― at protests and rallies in the Phoenix area. Prosecutors said he was among the first to enter the U.S. Capitol that day.\n\nAngeli, who was charged under his legal name, Jacob Chansley, called the FBI and arranged an interview upon his return to Phoenix. He was arrested at that meeting on Jan. 9, 2021.\n\nAfter learning of the pardon, he posted on X that \"J6ers are getting released & justice has come...Everything done in the dark will come to light.\"\n\nHe posted a cartoon image of himself in a version of his signature getup. But rather than the spear he brandished at the U.S. Capitol, the cartoon Angeli held a rifle in the air. He did not respond to an emailed request for an interview.\n\nRepublic reporter Stacey Barchenger contributed to this article.\n\nReach Ruelas at 602-444-8473 or richard.ruelas@arizonarepublic.com .

      "text": "Newly pardoned QAnon Shaman to trade his spear for a gun. God bless America | Opinion\n\nSo, you've just been pardoned for your part in storming the U.S. Capitol and trying to overturn democracy. What are you going to do now?\n\nIf you're Jake Angeli-Chansley, you're going to go ... buy some guns.\n\nOh, goodie.\n\nChansley, aka the QAnon Shaman, was the bare-chested, behorned loon who became the face of the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nOf course, we in Arizona already knew him, what with him showing up at various rallies and protests with the lungs of a lion and a sign that read, \"Q Sent Me.\"\n\nAmerica got its introduction to Chansley on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHe's the guy who was sporting that bizarre Viking look as he paraded through the Capitol hallways, decked out in his furry horned hat and face paint and carrying his flag-festooned spear.\n\nHe's the guy who ignored repeated police orders to leave the building.\n\nHe was one of the first Trump supporters to enter the Capitol, wherein he proceeded to scale the Senate dais and claim the seat Vice President Mike Pence had fled just an hour earlier.\n\n\"Is there any chance I can get you guys to leave the Senate wing?\" a police officer in the room asked as Angeli posed for pictures. \"I just want to let you guys know this is, like, the sacredest place.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna take a sit in this chair because Mike Pence is a f---ing traitor,\" Angeli replied.\n\nHe then left a note for the vice president: \"It's Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming!\"\n\nSome might say justice came when Chansley pleaded guilty in September 2021 to obstruction of an official proceeding, a federal felony, and served a portion of his 41-month prison sentence before being released in early 2023 .\n\nAt least, those who believe in the rule of law might say so.\n\nBut this is a week to celebrate criminals. We saw it with outgoing President Joe Biden's last-second commutation of the double life sentence given to Leonard Peltier, who murdered two FBI agents.\n\nNow-former FBI Director Christopher Wray begged Biden not to do it, noting that \"no fewer than 22 federal judges have evaluated the evidence\" and rejected Peltier's claim that he's innocent of the 1975 killings of FBI Special Agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams.\n\nThe two agents were shot in the head at close range during a standoff on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.\n\nNow we're seeing it with President Donald Trump's pardons and commutations of those who committed both violent and nonviolent acts during their Jan. 6 assault on the nation's Capitol.\n\nOr as the MAGA Nation calls them, \"heroes.\"\n\nIn all, Trump is offering clemency to nearly 1,600 rioters, issuing pardons to most and commuting the sentences of 14 members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers militia, most of whom were convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nBeat up a cop? No worries. You're good to go.\n\nAs for Chansley, at least he didn't assault any of the 140 police officers who were injured that day.\n\nHis only assault was on democracy.\n\nDuring court proceedings, Chansley's lawyer, Albert Watkins, told a judge his client suffered longstanding mental health problems and was in dire need of mental health treatment.\n\nI certainly hope he got it because it seems Chansley, a felon no more, is trading in his spear for something a little more lethal.\n\n\"JUST GOT THE NEWS FROM MY LAWYER ... I GOT A PARDON BABY! THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!\" he wrote on Monday evening in a social media post.\n\n\"NOW I AM GONNA BUY SOME MOTHA F--- GUNS!!! I LOVE THIS COUNTRY!!! GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!! J6ers are getting released & JUSTICE HAS COME ... EVERYTHING done in the dark WILL come to light!\"\n\nBehold America, on its way to becoming great again.\n\nReach Roberts at laurie.roberts@arizonarepublic.com .

It is their first holiday together, having met while he was under house arrest, and the first time he has tasted the sea air since he turned himself in in March 2021 - two months after the riots at the US Capitol in Washington DC.\n\nThirty-one days after Mr Trump issued a controversial blanket pardon to the nearly 1,600 criminal defendants charged with taking part in the Capitol riots, not all those released have been so fortunate.\n\nSibick hardly fits the mould of the bull-horned shaman who came to symbolise the anarchy that ensued when Mr Trump ordered his supporters to march on the Capitol to protest the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nA hospital finance director with a masters degree in public health, he is the son of a dentist and a teacher who, along with his three brothers, spent his childhood holidays in Florida or at the family's second home in Canada.\n\nBut in July 2023, he was sentenced to just over four years in prison after pleading guilty to participating in the assault of Michael Fanone, a police officer who suffered a heart attack and concussion after being beaten by a violent mob .\n\nHaving served a total of nearly two years behind bars and a similar stretch under home confinement, Sibick is now back working as a medical consultant and pays tribute to Mr Trump for giving him his life back.\n\nDespite pleading guilty, he continues to dispute his sentence, accusing the department of justice of \"egregious overreach\" and claiming he only went to the Capitol to \"peacefully protest\". He also draws a distinction between his actions and those who had \"ulterior motives\".\n\nHis fellow pardoned \"J6ers\" as they have come to be known, have had varying experiences since the pardons were handed down one month ago today.\n\nSo far, five are facing separate charges ranging from a murder plot to possessing child pornography. One was killed after an altercation with police during a traffic stop.\n\nDozens of those pardoned had previous criminal convictions. A woman who said she was abused by a Jan 6 defendant has expressed fear that he will show up at her home after he was freed.\n\nThe mass-release has triggered a legal battle, with defendants arguing they should be absolved of their other alleged crimes under the terms of Mr Trump's act of clemency.\n\nEdward Kelley, the fourth rioter to enter the Capitol on Jan 6, was convicted of assaulting a police officer in November last year, with the FBI alleging he was carrying a handgun at the time.\n\nLater the same month, a jury convicted him of conspiring to murder the FBI agents who investigated him and for producing a \"kill list\" of targets.\n\n\"Every hit has to hurt,\" Kelley said to a co-conspirator, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nHowever, Kelley, from Tennessee, is arguing that his murder plot conviction should be thrown out, claiming the president's pardon covering \"offences related to events that occurred at or near\" the Capitol riots should extend beyond that day.\n\nOthers accused of sexual offences involving children could also have their charges thrown out.\n\nDavid Paul Daniel, 37, pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer during the Capitol riots on Jan 8 2025, months after being arrested on child pornography charges.\n\nDuring a search of his North Carolina home in November 2023, federal officers recovered an iPhone and multiple other devices belonging to Daniel that allegedly contained images - taken between 2015 and 2019 - of him sexually abusing a girl younger then 12, according to court documents seen by Queen City News.\n\nThe child is said to have accused Daniel of abusing her, while the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office reportedly opened a statutory rape investigation in March 2023 in which police uncovered images of a second child being sexually abused.\n\nDaniel was arrested for the trafficking and possession of child pornography and sexual exploitation of a minor related to sexual assault on Sept 20 2024, Queen City News reported.\n\nAnother rioter from Texas accused of sex crimes with a minor was re-arrested in the days after being pardoned.\n\nOn Jan 27, county prosecutors in Houston, announced a manhunt for Andrew Taake, in relation to a 2016 charge of soliciting a minor online.\n\nPrior to his release, Taake, 36, had been serving a six-year prison sentence after admitting to spraying police officers with bear spray and striking another with a metal whip on Jan 6.\n\nPolice were initially alerted to his actions after he bragged about his behaviour on a dating app, causing his prospective match to contact the FBI.\n\nAfter two weeks on the run, he was captured by authorities in Texas on Feb 6 this year, having been charged with sending sexually explicit messages to an undercover officer who was pretending to be a 15-year-old girl, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nLess than 48 hours after being released from jail, Daniel Ball was re-arrested on gun charges.\n\nBall, 39, had been held in pretrial detention in Washington DC and was facing charges for detonating an \"explosive device\" in the entrance to the Capitol, injuring several officers.\n\nFollowing his release, federal prosecutors swiftly moved to re-apprehend him on charges of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.\n\nThe alleged crime dates back to May 2023, when the weapon was seized during a search of his Florida home related to the Jan 6 case.\n\nThe charge papers also outlined Ball's two previous convictions for domestic violence battery by strangulation in June 2017 and for battering and resisting law enforcement with violence in October 2021.\n\nBefore January came to a close, a Missouri woman convicted for her role in the Capitol riots was sent to prison for 10 years for killing a mother-of-two while drunk driving.\n\nEmily Hernandez, 24, was seen holding the broken nameplate of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the Jan 6 riots and served 30 days in a federal prison.\n\nBut on Jan 29, she was sentenced in Missouri state court for killing a woman and seriously injuring her husband while driving under the influence.\n\nHer attorneys said she was always experiencing \"feelings of remorse, grief, sadness and shame\" for her actions.\n\nPamela Hemphill, 71 from Boise, Idaho, pleaded guilty to her role in the Capitol riots in 2023 and was sentenced to 60 days in prison, but was the one defendant to refuse a presidential pardon.\n\nHemphill told The Telegraph she is not surprised swathes of the J6ers have been accused of re-offending.\n\n\"Given their past history and what they did on Jan 6, we shouldn't be surprised. These are career criminals, they're not patriots. They should still be locked up.\"\n\nA retired alcohol and drug councillor, she said she became consumed by the Maga movement during Mr Trump's first term and came to believe the election was stolen after being fed what she now deems \"propaganda and lies\" from fellow supporters.\n\nOn Jan 6 2021, she took part in the protests and credits Capitol police officers with saving her life after she was pushed to the ground and trampled on as rioters surged forward to break into the government building.\n\n\"Accepting a pardon would have been an insult to the Capitol police officers, rule of law and our nation,\" she said.\n\nHemphill shot to public attention after being nicknamed the \"Maga granny\" by broadcasters highlighting the perceived injustice of tough sentences handed out to those convicted for their involvement in the riots.\n\nIt was only after being released from prison, when she accused a fellow defendant of lying and felt the wrath of the Maga movement turn on her, that the grandmother-of-two became disillusioned with the cause.\n\n\"You don't realise you're in a cult at the time,\" she said. \"I thought I was a patriot and standing up for our country...but I was ashamed of my involvement and it was for me to make amends.\"\n\nHemphill believes the defendants who have been released should be required to report themselves to local authorities in the same way as sex offenders, so that citizens can be made aware if they live nearby.\n\n\"These people are very dangerous,\" she said. \"We've got these criminals running around with no probation.\"\n\nEarlier this month, dozens of defendants joined forces on X to publish the names of 124 people who had played a role in their convictions, including prosecutors, FBI agents and judges.\n\nThe post, viewed tens of thousands of times, included photos of many individuals alongside insulting comments and demands for accountability.\n\nHemphill said she had been told to be careful, given her role as a prominent critic of the defendants, but refuses to \"live in fear\". \"I don't like bullies,\" she said.\n\nWhile most Jan 6 defendants have welcomed a clean slate or are fighting to extend the scope of Mr Trump's pardons, Hemphill is battling to return hers.\n\n\"I pleaded guilty because I was guilty,\" she said.\n\n\"The justice department was not weaponised against me, I was a participant who broke the law. Accepting a pardon would only serve to contribute to their gaslighting and false narrative.\"\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

It is their first holiday together, having met while he was under house arrest, and the first time he has tasted the sea air since he turned himself in in March 2021 - two months after the riots at the US Capitol in Washington DC.\n\nThirty-one days after Mr Trump issued a controversial blanket pardon to the nearly 1,600 criminal defendants charged with taking part in the Capitol riots, not all those released have been so fortunate.\n\nSibick hardly fits the mould of the bull-horned shaman who came to symbolise the anarchy that ensued when Mr Trump ordered his supporters to march on the Capitol to protest the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nA hospital finance director with a masters degree in public health, he is the son of a dentist and a teacher who, along with his three brothers, spent his childhood holidays in Florida or at the family's second home in Canada.\n\nBut in July 2023, he was sentenced to just over four years in prison after pleading guilty to participating in the assault of Michael Fanone, a police officer who suffered a heart attack and concussion after being beaten by a violent mob .\n\nHaving served a total of nearly two years behind bars and a similar stretch under home confinement, Sibick is now back working as a medical consultant and pays tribute to Mr Trump for giving him his life back.\n\nDespite pleading guilty, he continues to dispute his sentence, accusing the department of justice of \"egregious overreach\" and claiming he only went to the Capitol to \"peacefully protest\". He also draws a distinction between his actions and those who had \"ulterior motives\".\n\nHis fellow pardoned \"J6ers\" as they have come to be known, have had varying experiences since the pardons were handed down one month ago today.\n\nSo far, five are facing separate charges ranging from a murder plot to possessing child pornography. One was killed after an altercation with police during a traffic stop.\n\nDozens of those pardoned had previous criminal convictions. A woman who said she was abused by a Jan 6 defendant has expressed fear that he will show up at her home after he was freed.\n\nThe mass-release has triggered a legal battle, with defendants arguing they should be absolved of their other alleged crimes under the terms of Mr Trump's act of clemency.\n\nEdward Kelley, the fourth rioter to enter the Capitol on Jan 6, was convicted of assaulting a police officer in November last year, with the FBI alleging he was carrying a handgun at the time.\n\nLater the same month, a jury convicted him of conspiring to murder the FBI agents who investigated him and for producing a \"kill list\" of targets.\n\n\"Every hit has to hurt,\" Kelley said to a co-conspirator, according to the Department of Justice.\n\nHowever, Kelley, from Tennessee, is arguing that his murder plot conviction should be thrown out, claiming the president's pardon covering \"offences related to events that occurred at or near\" the Capitol riots should extend beyond that day.\n\nOthers accused of sexual offences involving children could also have their charges thrown out.\n\nDavid Paul Daniel, 37, pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer during the Capitol riots on Jan 8 2025, months after being arrested on child pornography charges.\n\nDuring a search of his North Carolina home in November 2023, federal officers recovered an iPhone and multiple other devices belonging to Daniel that allegedly contained images - taken between 2015 and 2019 - of him sexually abusing a girl younger then 12, according to court documents seen by Queen City News.\n\nThe child is said to have accused Daniel of abusing her, while the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office reportedly opened a statutory rape investigation in March 2023 in which police uncovered images of a second child being sexually abused.\n\nDaniel was arrested for the trafficking and possession of child pornography and sexual exploitation of a minor related to sexual assault on Sept 20 2024, Queen City News reported.\n\nAnother rioter from Texas accused of sex crimes with a minor was re-arrested in the days after being pardoned.\n\nOn Jan 27, county prosecutors in Houston, announced a manhunt for Andrew Taake, in relation to a 2016 charge of soliciting a minor online.\n\nPrior to his release, Taake, 36, had been serving a six-year prison sentence after admitting to spraying police officers with bear spray and striking another with a metal whip on Jan 6.\n\nPolice were initially alerted to his actions after he bragged about his behaviour on a dating app, causing his prospective match to contact the FBI.\n\nAfter two weeks on the run, he was captured by authorities in Texas on Feb 6 this year, having been charged with sending sexually explicit messages to an undercover officer who was pretending to be a 15-year-old girl, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nLess than 48 hours after being released from jail, Daniel Ball was re-arrested on gun charges.\n\nBall, 39, had been held in pretrial detention in Washington DC and was facing charges for detonating an \"explosive device\" in the entrance to the Capitol, injuring several officers.\n\nFollowing his release, federal prosecutors swiftly moved to re-apprehend him on charges of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.\n\nThe alleged crime dates back to May 2023, when the weapon was seized during a search of his Florida home related to the Jan 6 case.\n\nThe charge papers also outlined Ball's two previous convictions for domestic violence battery by strangulation in June 2017 and for battering and resisting law enforcement with violence in October 2021.\n\nBefore January came to a close, a Missouri woman convicted for her role in the Capitol riots was sent to prison for 10 years for killing a mother-of-two while drunk driving.\n\nEmily Hernandez, 24, was seen holding the broken nameplate of then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the Jan 6 riots and served 30 days in a federal prison.\n\nBut on Jan 29, she was sentenced in Missouri state court for killing a woman and seriously injuring her husband while driving under the influence.\n\nHer attorneys said she was always experiencing \"feelings of remorse, grief, sadness and shame\" for her actions.\n\nPamela Hemphill, 71 from Boise, Idaho, pleaded guilty to her role in the Capitol riots in 2023 and was sentenced to 60 days in prison, but was the one defendant to refuse a presidential pardon.\n\nHemphill told The Telegraph she is not surprised swathes of the J6ers have been accused of re-offending.\n\n\"Given their past history and what they did on Jan 6, we shouldn't be surprised. These are career criminals, they're not patriots. They should still be locked up.\"\n\nA retired alcohol and drug councillor, she said she became consumed by the Maga movement during Mr Trump's first term and came to believe the election was stolen after being fed what she now deems \"propaganda and lies\" from fellow supporters.\n\nOn Jan 6 2021, she took part in the protests and credits Capitol police officers with saving her life after she was pushed to the ground and trampled on as rioters surged forward to break into the government building.\n\n\"Accepting a pardon would have been an insult to the Capitol police officers, rule of law and our nation,\" she said.\n\nHemphill shot to public attention after being nicknamed the \"Maga granny\" by broadcasters highlighting the perceived injustice of tough sentences handed out to those convicted for their involvement in the riots.\n\nIt was only after being released from prison, when she accused a fellow defendant of lying and felt the wrath of the Maga movement turn on her, that the grandmother-of-two became disillusioned with the cause.\n\n\"You don't realise you're in a cult at the time,\" she said. \"I thought I was a patriot and standing up for our country...but I was ashamed of my involvement and it was for me to make amends.\"\n\nHemphill believes the defendants who have been released should be required to report themselves to local authorities in the same way as sex offenders, so that citizens can be made aware if they live nearby.\n\n\"These people are very dangerous,\" she said. \"We've got these criminals running around with no probation.\"\n\nEarlier this month, dozens of defendants joined forces on X to publish the names of 124 people who had played a role in their convictions, including prosecutors, FBI agents and judges.\n\nThe post, viewed tens of thousands of times, included photos of many individuals alongside insulting comments and demands for accountability.\n\nHemphill said she had been told to be careful, given her role as a prominent critic of the defendants, but refuses to \"live in fear\". \"I don't like bullies,\" she said.\n\nWhile most Jan 6 defendants have welcomed a clean slate or are fighting to extend the scope of Mr Trump's pardons, Hemphill is battling to return hers.\n\n\"I pleaded guilty because I was guilty,\" she said.\n\n\"The justice department was not weaponised against me, I was a participant who broke the law. Accepting a pardon would only serve to contribute to their gaslighting and false narrative.\"\n\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

      "text": "Even Some J6ers Don't Agree With Trump's Blanket Pardon\n\nManage your account\n\nSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nThis week, House Republicans announced they intended to create a select subcommittee to investigate the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and uncover the \"full truth that is owed to the American people,\" Speaker Mike Johnson said. Presumably this is a \"truth\" that somehow fell outside the frames of the thousands of videos taken that day that showed rioters storming the building and beating police officers with whatever weapons were at hand. Despite January 6 being an extraordinarily well-documented crime, many Republicans seem intent on whitewashing what many federal judges, jurors, and really any average American citizen can see with their own eyes.\n\nIn the past year, I've gotten to know many J6ers well. My partner, Lauren Ober, and I made the podcast We Live Here Now . The thing they had all been waiting for are the pardons that President Donald Trump delivered as promised \"on day one.\" Trump kept his promise. Hours after being sworn in, he gave clemency to more than 1,500 people convicted of involvement at the Capitol that day. Among them were some longtime militia leaders who carefully planned the riot. Now they're free. For some, this is order restored; for so many other Americans, this is lawless abandon. And not everyone is reacting to the pardons the way you might expect.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nMarie Johnatakis: Hello?\n\nHanna Rosin: Hey, this is actually Hanna Rosin. I'm calling on my son's phone for various reasons.\n\nJohnatakis: Hanna! How are you?\n\nRosin: You sound happy.\n\nJohnatakis: I am. I just got done bawling.\n\nRosin: Bawling. As in crying. Hard.\n\nJohnatakis: I think everything just came out. I was just holding it in for the last how many years?\n\nRosin: That was Marie Johnatakis, whose husband, Taylor, was just pardoned by President Donald Trump. He'd been sentenced to over seven years for what he did at the Capitol on January 6. Now he's coming home.\n\nThis is Radio Atlantic . I'm Hanna Rosin.\n\nA few hours into his second term, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Some had been charged with serious felonies, like assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy. Others were charged with misdemeanors, like trespassing and disorderly conduct.\n\nI've gotten to know a lot of January 6ers over the last couple of years, so I know how these prosecutions have upended their lives. And I know that for a lot of them, the pardons have restored their sense of justice. For them, this week feels like the world is set right again.\n\nAnd as I checked in with them this week, and hung out outside the D.C. jail, mostly I just saw the chasm more clearly: how one person's order restored is another person's lawless abandon.\n\nJohnatakis: I know this is going to sound crazy, but I have just really felt like Trump will do what he says he's gonna do. And so, ever since that, I was like, \"Well, if Taylor gets pardoned, it will be the first day.\"\n\nRosin: Three weeks ago, when her world was still in chaos, Marie Johnatakis bought a one-way ticket home for Taylor. Trump had mentioned that he might pardon all the January 6ers, but you could never be sure. Politicians don't usually do what they say, her daughter told her. And for a family whose only working parent had been in jail for more than a year, an airline ticket is a luxury.\n\nBut Marie had watched the video over and over of Trump telling an NBC reporter that he would pardon the J6ers on day one of taking office.\n\nDonald Trump: We're gonna look at everything. We're gonna look at individual cases-\n\nKristen Welker: Everyone?\n\nTrump: Yeah.\n\nWelker: Okay.\n\nTrump: But I'm going to be acting very quickly.\n\nWelker: Within your first 100 days? First day?\n\nTrump: First day.\n\nWelker: First day?\n\nTrump: Yeah. I'm looking first day. Welker: You'll issue these pardons.\n\nRosin: And then on day one, the world flipped.\n\nMan: First we have a list of pardons and commutations relating to the events that occurred on January 6, 2021. Trump: Okay. And how many people is this? Man: I think this order will apply to approximately 1,500 people, sir. Trump: So this is January 6. And these are the hostages, approximately 1,500 for a pardon. Full pardon.\n\nRosin: On Monday night, just before midnight, Marie finally picked Taylor up from prison, and she sent me a picture. They sat side by side, smiling, like a late Christmas-card photo. Marie hasn't sat side by side with her husband since he was taken into custody just before Christmas 2023.\n\nI asked her if she thought his transition home would be rocky, and she said no-it'll be seamless. Taylor has written each of their five children a letter a week from prison, and he sometimes reads them books over the phone. In her mind, family harmony will be quickly restored, and so will the rightness of all things.\n\nJohnatakis: I mean, this started with January 6, four years ago, and we were the scum of the Earth. We were domestic terrorists. We were people that you were supposed to be afraid of. Every time Trump had anything with criminal charges or anything like that, he has really been our hope for anything that would ever mean a pardon for us. And so a lot of us feel like it was one miracle after another.\n\nAnd people don't look to Trump-people in the movement on the chats that I'm on and stuff like that don't look to him like a savior. But I think a lot of the people-almost everyone has faith, like a faith in God, a faith in Jesus. And I do hear a lot of like, for us, it's a miracle.\n\nRosin: There is a whole other way that these pardons could have rolled out.\n\nA little more than a week before inauguration, Vice President J. D. Vance made it clear to Fox News that he wasn't expecting blanket pardons.\n\nJ. D. Vance: If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned. And there's a little bit of a gray area there, but we're very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law.\n\nRosin: During the transition, I spoke with Republican lawyers who imagined there might be some kind of review board, like maybe a Justice Department committee that would evaluate cases such as Taylor's.\n\nTaylor was not among the several hundred convicted solely of misdemeanors, such as trespassing or disorderly conduct. But also, he was not among the small handful convicted of seditious conspiracy. His assault charge hung on the fact that he was yelling into his bullhorn, urging a crowd to push a barricade into a row of cops. All captured on video.\n\nTaylor Johnatakis: One foot! One, two, three, go!\n\nRosin: And under the J. D. Vance scenario, there would have been qualified lawyers debating in a room about degrees of \"assault\" and what length of sentence they merit. But instead, Trump chose to go with a blanket pardon, which sounds uncomplicated but actually brings maximum chaos.\n\nTuesday night, I was walking down my own street past a house that I know well. It's a kind of safe house for January 6ers. Micki Witthoeft lives there. She's the mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed at the Capitol that day. So does Nicole Reffitt, whose husband, Guy, was sentenced to over seven years for bringing a gun to the Capitol. Occasionally, a young January 6er named Brandon Fellows stays there too.\n\nMy partner, Lauren Ober, and I got to know the people in that house last year when we made an Atlantic podcast about it called We Live Here Now . I've walked by their house hundreds of times. But when I walked the dogs past the house on Tuesday in freezing weather, I saw Brandon outside, wearing an ICE jacket-as in Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This is his version of a sartorial troll.\n\nRosin: So what's going on? I guess I don't even know the basics of what's going on.\n\nFellows: Last I heard was from Jen. We were at lunch with Stewart Rhodes-breakfast with Stewart Rhodes today.\n\nRosin: He's here?\n\nFellows: Yes. But we've all been up, and he's taking a nap real quick. So we just got back, but-\n\nRosin: Is he staying here?\n\nRosin : I froze-and not from the cold. Stewart Rhodes, the guy with the eye patch, who founded the Oathkeepers. He for years recruited and cultivated an armed militia to resist government tyranny. His estranged ex-wife recently said she fears that she and their kids are on his quote \" kill list .\" Rhodes's attorneys have said that the idea that his family's in danger is unfounded.\n\nBefore Trump's commutation he was serving an 18-year sentence for seditious conspiracy, one of the longest of all the January 6ers. Now Stewart Rhodes was taking a nap down the block from my house.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nMore on that after the break.\n\n[ Break ]\n\nRosin: While Rhodes was napping in her house, Nicole Reffitt, was outside, being interviewed by a Dutch news crew. Her family is notorious, because her son, Jackson, turned in his father to the FBI. Someone adapted the trial transcript into an excellent play called Fatherland . Anyway, this week her husband, Guy, was about to get out of prison. But unlike Marie Johnatakis, she seemed unsettled about the pardons.\n\nRosin: How do you guys feel about the blanket pardon?\n\nReffitt: You know, I was never a fan of that. I guess he thought it was the quickest way-pull the Band-Aid off. I was more in favor of commutations and then let's look at everything, because not only did people do bad things that day, but there were some charges that were absolutely wielded like a weapon against people. And those things also need to be looked at because, you know, I don't want anyone to have to go through this. And that's my biggest concern.\n\nRosin: What do you mean \"concern\"? Like, I don't know how to think about the blanket pardon either, Nicole. I'm trying to think what's the difference between this and if it had gone a different way-what does it mean that it's a blanket? Have you guys talked about that?\n\nReffitt: Well, because now all charges are gone.\n\nRosin: Yeah.\n\nReffitt: You know, and, uh, I'm a law-and-order gal, really. And so not all charges should be gone there. People did really bad things that day.\n\nRosin: In many people's minds, Nicole's husband, Guy, was one of the people who did really bad things that day, and he did get a fair sentence. Guy brought a gun to the Capitol, although he didn't enter the building or use it.\n\nReffitt: Yeah, I never expected him not to have something, you know, like, I figured he'd be charged with something, because it was so significant, but it was just so over-the-top to me, all of the charges and that has always been my biggest issue.\n\n[ Crowd chanting ]\n\nRosin: As of Wednesday only eight of the 22 people held at the D.C. jail had been released. But outside the jail had turned into a gathering place for people released from all over the country. Camera crews stood around from Sweden, Japan, Norway broadcasting interviews with the newly freed. And when Bob Marley's \"Redemption Song\" came on the speakers, the crowd belted it out together.\n\n[ Sound of \"Redemption Song\" by Bob Marley ]\n\nRosin: On Tuesday night, I caught a glimpse of Stewart Rhodes at the edge of the crowd. He's hard to miss, with the eye patch. He was giving an interview to a right-wing YouTuber.\n\nStewart Rhodes: It's a day of celebration. I mean, yesterday it was too. When President Trump was inaugurated, it was awesome. You know, like he said himself, you know, God saved him to save America, and I believe that's true. And then he turned around and saved us last night, I mean, and restored us to our freedom. I mean, I'm not 100 percent restored yet. I'm still waiting for a pardon, but it's so, so wonderful to be out, be out of these bars.\n\nRosin: That's Rhodes's one big complaint-that he'd been given a commutation instead of a pardon. A commutation can erase a sentence, but it does not restore all your rights, such as the right to buy guns. He told the interviewer he was applying for a pardon. He said, \" I think everyone deserves a pardon, without any exception.\"\n\nRhodes: No one got a fair trial. It's impossible to get a fair trial here if you're a Trump supporter. And so you don't have an unbiased jury, an impartial jury; you don't have an impartial judge; you don't have a jury that's going to hold the government to its standard beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nIt's not going to happen. So if you have no chance of a fair trial, then you should be presumed innocent. That's put back in your natural state, which is an innocent and free human being.\n\nRosin : So that's Rhodes's version of history. They were sham trials. It was actually a day of peace. It's a revision of history that Trump and his allies are likely to try to push and push for the next four years. House Speaker Mike Johnson has already formed a select subcommittee on January 6, to quote \"continue our efforts to uncover the full truth that is owed to the American people\"\n\nBut for a whole crew of other people involved in January 6, these pardons represent a reversal of justice.\n\nJanuary 6 did not require delicate forensics. It has to be one of the most well-documented crimes in modern history.

      "text": "Ex-Special Forces soldier from Tampa among 'J6ers' still in jail after pardon\n\nManage your account\n\nRetired U.S. Army Special Forces master sergeant Jeremy Brown remains in jail while his attorney advocates for his release under President Donald Trump's pardon for Jan. 6 crimes .\n\nBrown, a Tampa resident sentenced to seven years on weapons charges, is among a handful of still-incarcerated convicts who are most associated with the 2021 U.S. Capitol riot, but who were charged with other crimes outside of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe argument being made for Brown's release: his other crimes only came to light through the course of Jan. 6 investigations.\n\nAs hundreds of prisoners walked free following Trump's proclamation, Brown, 50, was transferred last week from a Washington, D.C. jail to the Grayson County Detention Center in Kentucky. The reason for the transfer is unclear.\n\nA jury in 2022 convicted Brown on charges of possessing an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, a short-barrelled rifle, fragmentation grenades and a classified military document. Federal agents said they'd found them on his Florida property while serving a search warrant related to Jan. 6 and his ties to the Oath Keepers, a militaristic far-right group that entered the Capitol.\n\nBrown also was charged with two misdemeanors for attending the Jan. 6 riot, where he was photographed in a helmet and military gear. Those charges, court records show, were dropped shortly after the president's pardon.\n\nA memo prepared by one of Brown's attorneys with the heading \"Free Jeremy Brown\" argues that the pardon should apply to Brown's federal convictions for crimes in Florida because they are \"100% J6 related as required by the Presidential Proclamation. Jeremy was arrested and imprisoned based on J6 allegations that led to a pretextual search warrant.\"\n\nThat lawyer, Plant City-based Carolyn Stewart, posted online Saturday that \"our facts have reached the White House & the solution is in the works.\"\n\nOther \"J6ers\" with similarly unclear pardon situations include Homosassa's Daniel Ball, 38, who was released and quickly re-arrested on a warrant for gun possession - a charge that emerged from a search related to Jan. 6.\n\nDominic Box, who was awaiting sentencing for felony civil disorder, remains in the same Kentucky jail as Brown. While awaiting trial for his Jan. 6 charges, Box was arrested by a deputy who said he found him passed out in his car outside a Jacksonville restaurant.\n\nBen Martin, a California man convicted of illegally possessing eight firearms that agents found during a Jan. 6-related search, also remains in custody after his Jan. 6 charges were pardoned.\n\nCalls for the release of these so-called \"left-behind J6ers\" have been amplified in right-wing media and spread through pro-MAGA corners of the internet since the president issued his pardons on his first day back in office. A common refrain: \"No man left behind.\"\n\nClose Trump ally Roger Stone posted on X about Brown and Martin, writing \"I will not rest until these victims are free. In fact, I'm working on it right now.\" Former CBS News journalist turned right-wing pundit Lara Logan has also advocated for Brown's release.\n\nStewart's memo on Brown reiterates a claim that Brown's former attorney made at trial - that federal agents planted the grenades and other evidence. They cited forensics showing the items lacked Brown's DNA.\n\nThe jury, which heard audio of Brown reacting to news that agents found the grenades, apparently didn't believe that defense. Jurors convicted Brown on six federal charges, including the grenades, and found him not guilty of four.\n\nBrown appealed. Oral arguments in that appellate case are scheduled for March 6 at the U.S. courthouse in Jacksonville.\n\nIn a lengthy statement at his sentencing in Tampa, Brown mentioned his connection to Jan. 6, 2021, suggesting the riot was orchestrated by the FBI.\n\nBrown has maintained a public presence despite years of incarceration, recording podcasts over the phone and running an unsuccessful campaign for the Florida House of Representatives from jail."

Jan. 6 rioters will get to stay in these homes for free.\n\nMcCombs, 40, and her husband Doug believe the \"J6 Road Home\" sanctuary could allow a handful of rioters to \"find healing\" after receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump .\n\n\"Doug and Jenny have worked tirelessly to create a supportive network of local business owners, guests, and patrons eager to employ and mentor the J6 defendants,\" the website states. \"This network aims to provide them with opportunities to reestablish themselves in a welcoming, conservative, and patriotic community.\"\n\n\"This project represents not just a fresh start for those in need but also a beacon of hope and redemption,\" it adds.\n\nIn a separate interview with the Daily Mail 's online section, McCombs said her property will allow rioters to spend three months finding their way back to a more normal life.\n\n\"A lot have lost their ability to make an income, [but] I think everyone deserves a second chance,\" she said. \"Life shouldn't be dictated by one day.\"\n\nAt the time she spoke to the news outlet, McCombs said she already had two men booked in to stay at her residency.\n\n\"We think we'll be full soon. I plan on cooking for all of them, I'm an excellent cook.\"\n\nMcCombs was one of some 1,500 rioters who entered the Capitol and faced criminal charges, before President Donald Trump 's pardons came into action on his first day in office.\n\nShe is unlikely to be able to house all 1,500 men and women within the next few years.\n\nMcCombs told the newspaper she did not regret storming into the restricted building and spending 19 minutes indoors, despite pleading guilty and being pictured live-streaming the scenes with her smartphone and a Trump flag around her neck.\n\n\"A presidential pardon won't have a big effect on my life, but it's a big thing [for others],\" she said.\n\nShe also explained how she suffered deep psychological distress before divine intervention prompted her to open her property up to other formerly convicted criminals.\n\nThe website itself makes this point in crystalline terms: \"Doug and Jenny have been blessed with 11 beautiful acres in the Texas Hill Country, a place they believe God led them to for a greater purpose: To hire, feed, and house January 6th defendants as they transition out of prison and rebuild their lives.\"\n\nIt also boasts several partner organizations on its website. This includes the 'Old Glory Bank,' which self-describes as a 'pro-America' bank with no links to Wall Street, the 'American Gulag Chronicles,' a book series which shares letters from U.S. prisons, and an organization named 'The Original Stop Hate,' which defends far-right militia groups such as the Oath Keepers and exploits the yellow ribbon most commonly associated with campaigns to release Israeli hostages to advocate for 'J6ERS.\n\nThe J6 Road Home website also contains a box stating employers in Texas are willing to hire Capitol rioters \"regardless of what criminal record they may now have.\""

      "text": "Pardoned Jan. 6 defendants get hero's welcome, star status at CPAC\n\nManage your account\n\nNATIONAL HARBOR, Md. - Individuals pardoned by President Trump over their involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot are off-stage stars at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this year.\n\nMore than a dozen of the \"J6ers\" are in attendance at the gathering of conservatives, and they are being treated like war heroes.\n\nA group of them were interviewed live for former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" show in the CPAC exhibition complex. Some of them participated in a live team quiz show against another team of CPAC attendees. Many got stopped for selfies by other CPAC attendees, or just to chat.\n\n\"We became celebrities here. It's weird,\" said Brian Mock, one of the roughly 1,500 people whom Trump pardoned in connection with Jan. 6.\n\n\"We used to be really the most hated people in America. And now, you know, we're getting recognized at church and get a standing ovation at church,\" Mock said.\n\nMock, 46, was convicted of six felonies and five misdemeanors , including assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers - which he maintains was the result of an unfair trial, after enduring harsh conditions in jail.\n\nAlso at CPAC being greeted by numerous attendees was Stewart Rhodes, the founder of the Oath Keepers who was convicted of seditious conspiracy. Rhodes was one of 14 people who got a commutation rather than a full pardon from Trump in relation to Jan. 6.\n\nControversy bubbled up around the J6ers Wednesday night as attendees picked up badges. A number of those who received pardons and commutations said they were turned away and left - prompting outrage from some on the right and their supporters.\n\nCPAC on Thursday morning disputed that people were turned away because of Jan. 6, posting a statement on social platform X : \"It is untrue that we are not allowing people to come to CPAC because of their involvement with J6. In fact, CPAC has been a constant supporter of this persecuted community and we support wholeheartedly President Trump's pardons of the J6 victims. The registration link is active and tickets will be sold out very soon.\"\n\nOne of those who had an issue Wednesday night was Rhodes. But on Thursday, the Oath Keepers founder got his pass and red lanyard granting him full run of CPAC.\n\n\"I'm going to take them at face value that there was some kind of an error that someone in the staff made that wasn't fully approved,\" Rhodes told The Hill.\n\nThe coalescing of Jan. 6 defendants at CPAC is part spontaneous, part organized by the close network of other Jan. 6 defendants. Mock said he has driven around the country to talk to other J6ers in recent weeks to get their stories out. Some have donation funds that paid for their tickets.\n\n\"We're like family for the rest of our lives. We support each other,\" said Gabriel Garcia, a former member of the Proud Boys and a retired Army captain who was convicted of obstruction of law enforcement and obstruction of an official proceeding.\n\nGarcia gave interviews Thursday morning on CPAC's media row, wearing a bright orange shirt that said \"political prisoner\" and displaying a prop copy of his pardon paperwork.\n\nWhile some of the reasoning for attending CPAC is social, they also have more goals despite having secured pardons and commutations.\n\nRhodes is now a national spokesperson for Condemned USA , a legal advocacy group that focused heavily on Jan. 6 defendants, and is representing the organization at CPAC. Many of them are interested in getting in touch with the announced House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on Jan. 6 , which will be chaired by Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.).\n\nThey're also interested in getting in touch with other lawmakers. Mock caught House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) just after the congressman completed an interview, talking to him about Jan. 6 issues.\n\nFor 26-year-old Salvador Sandoval Jr. - who was convicted on four counts of assaulting officers among other counts before being released on Jan. 20 as a result of the pardon - the hero's welcome at CPAC is both strange and welcomed.\n\n\"It's vindicating. We've been demonized for so long,\" Sandoval said. \"I guess they trust Trump enough that when they pardon us, for the most part - maybe they're second questioning. 'Maybe they were screwed over. Maybe they didn't do anything wrong or didn't deserve to be in prison for so long.'\"\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "January 6ers Got Out of Prison-And Came to My Neighborhood\n\nManage your account\n\nOn Monday, Stewart Rhodes, the eye-patched founder of the far-right militia known as the Oath Keepers, was in prison, which is where he has been since he was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. By Tuesday afternoon, he was taking a nap at my neighbors' house.\n\nI learned this when I recently walked past that house, which I've gotten to know well. A couple of years ago, my partner and I discovered that it was a kind of refuge for January 6ers. The mother of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed during the riot, lives there, along with Nicole Reffitt, the wife of a Texas man who brought a gun to the Capitol grounds. Occasionally, a young January 6 defendant named Brandon Fellows stays at the house too. We got used to seeing them around the neighborhood, which, like most of Washington, D.C., is heavily Democratic. Before the election, the house was decorated with Christmas lights and the lawn with Trump signs, and no one complained. But on day one of Donald Trump's new presidency, something came loose.\n\nStrangers in MAGA hats and scarves started showing up with suitcases. Someone egged the house, twice. Fellows's motorcycle was stolen. Although it was freezing on Tuesday, lots of people were on the porch, people I didn't recognize. I spotted Fellows outside, wearing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement jacket, his version of a sartorial troll. \"We were at breakfast with Stewart,\" he said. \"He's taking a nap real quick.\"\n\n[ Listen: Even some J6ers don't agree with Trump's blanket pardon ]\n\nRhodes is among the most infamous J6ers for a reason. For years, he recruited and cultivated a militant group to resist government tyranny. His estranged ex-wife recently said she fears that she and some of her kids are on his \"kill list\" (lawyers for Rhodes denied this). In 2023, he was sentenced to 18 years for plotting to thwart the peaceful transfer of power on January 6.\n\nWhen I ran into Fellows, Rhodes had just been released from prison, after Trump had pardoned more than 1,500 January 6 defendants in his first hours back in office. Trump had repeatedly promised that the pardons were coming, but the fact that he included those charged with the most serious crimes came as a surprise. In effect, he chose not to distinguish between the mildly and the severely dangerous-people who demonstrated terrible judgment on one day, getting swept up in a mob, versus those who had planned to carry out violence, for example. (Rhodes, however, was one of 14 individuals granted a commutation, meaning his sentence was erased, but he did not have all his rights restored.)\n\nIn the past year, I spoke with many January 6ers and their families as my partner, Lauren Ober, and I made a podcast about our neighbors' house. I know how their lives have been upended by the prosecutions, and so I understand that, for many of them, day one was some kind of setting things right. Many of them absorbed Trump's framing: They thought of their loved ones as actual hostages, held by the government. \"Today, we are a free country,\" I heard one tearful father of a January 6er say outside the D.C. jail on Monday night as he waited for his son to be released.\n\nIn an instant, thousands of families were living a day they'd feared would never come. But in Donald Trump's America, one person's order restored is another person's lawless abandon.\n\nIn our podcast , my partner and I followed the story of Marie Johnatakis, whose husband, Taylor, had been serving a seven-year sentence in a federal prison in Springfield, Missouri. Three weeks ago, when her world was still in chaos, Marie bought a one-way ticket home for Taylor, back to Seattle. Her daughter kept cautioning her that politicians don't keep their promises-that Trump wouldn't follow through on the pardons he campaigned on-but Marie is an optimist. On Tuesday night, she sent me a picture of her and Taylor an hour after she had picked him up from prison. They sat side by side, smiling, like in a Christmas-card photo. I asked her if it would be hard to adjust to him being home but she said no; it would be seamless. Taylor has written each of their five children one letter a week from prison, and read them books over the phone. Family harmony will be restored, Marie believes, and so will the rightness of all things.\n\n\"I mean, this started with January 6, four years ago, and we were the scum of the Earth. We were 'domestic terrorists.' We were, you know, like, we were people that you were supposed to be afraid of. And then the January 6 committee and all of that, and every time Trump had anything with criminal charges,\" she told me. \"He's not a savior,\" she said of Trump. \"But for a lot of us, this is a miracle. A lot of us feel like it was one miracle after another.\"\n\n[ Read: Republican leaders once thought January 6 was 'tragic' ]\n\nBefore taking office for a second time, Trump sometimes said he would pardon defendants on a case-by-case basis. I spoke with Republican lawyers who mentioned the idea of a review board, a Justice Department committee that might evaluate cases such as Taylor's. His was a middling case; he was not among the several hundred people convicted solely of misdemeanors, such as trespassing and disorderly conduct, but nor was he among the small group convicted of seditious conspiracy. His charges involved using a megaphone to yell \"One, two, three, go!\" and lead a crowd to push a barricade into a row of police officers. In an alternative version of reality in which Trump had smashed history with slightly more finesse, lawyers might have debated in a room about which degrees of \"assault\" qualified which people for pardons, and you can imagine how Taylor might have won his freedom. But instead Trump chose a blanket pardon. Now the QAnon Shaman is posting about how excited he is to \"BUY SOME MOTHA FU*KIN GUNS!!!\"\n\nWhen I walked by my neighbors' house on Tuesday afternoon, Nicole Reffitt, the wife of the man who was sentenced for bringing a gun to the Capitol, was outside too, being interviewed by a Dutch news crew. Her husband, Guy, was about to get out of jail, and the family would move back to Texas. But unlike Marie Johnatakis, Nicole seemed unsettled. Not all January 6ers are happy about the pardons. One woman, known as \"MAGA Granny,\" has said she doesn't deserve a pardon and plans to complete her probation.\n\nNicole can think of a few defendants she believes don't deserve one. \" I'm a law-and-order gal, really,\" she told me. \"And so not all charges should be gone there. People did really bad things that day.\" In many people's minds, her husband was one of them, even though he didn't enter the Capitol or use his gun. She told me she was thinking of someone like Jacob Lang, who was captured on video swinging a baseball bat at police officers and thrusting a riot shield in their direction, according to an affidavit . At that moment, Lang, whose case never went to trial, was at the D.C. jail still waiting for his release, growing impatient. \"These tyrannical animals will not stop and we need President Trump to get these men released ASAP!!!!!\" someone posted on Monday from Lang's X account. He was released Tuesday night.\n\nOutside the D.C. jail on Monday and Tuesday, the former inmates were not quite running the asylum, but they were enchanting the crowd outside. So far, the 22 January 6ers held at the D.C. jail have been released slowly, a handful each day, but it has become a gathering place for the recently released from all over the country. On Tuesday night, Robert Morss , known as \" Lego Man \" because authorities found a Lego replica of the Capitol at his house, was a crowd favorite. Camera crews from Sweden, Japan, and Norway broadcast from outside the jail. Whenever Bob Marley's \"Redemption Song\" came on the speakers, the crowd belted it out.\n\nOn Tuesday night, I caught a glimpse of Rhodes at the edge of the crowd, giving an interview to a right-wing YouTuber. \"It's a day of celebration,\" he said. \"When President Trump was inaugurated, it was awesome. You know, like he said himself, God saved him to save America, and I believe that's true. And then he turned around and saved us last night.\" Rhodes's only complaint was that he'd been given a commutation; he told the interviewer he was applying for a pardon. \" I think everyone deserves a pardon, without any, without any exception,\" he said. \"It's impossible to get a fair trial here if you're a Trump supporter ... So if you have no chance of a fair trial, then you should be presumed innocent. That's put back in your natural state, which is an innocent and free human being.\" (Rhodes declined to talk with me.)\n\nThat's the view of January 6 that follows naturally from the pardons: They were sham trials. It was actually a day of peace. Trump and his allies are likely to push this revised version of history for the next four years. House Speaker Mike Johnson has already announced that he will form a select subcommittee on January 6, \"to continue our efforts to uncover the full truth that is owed to the American people.\"\n\n[ Read: Trump's pardons are sending a crystal-clear message ]\n\nHere is the truth. Prosecuting January 6ers did not require delicate forensics. Tens of thousands of hours of video show rioters beating up police with whatever tools are at hand. Five people died during the insurrection and in its immediate aftermath, and four police officers later died by suicide. Some 140 officers were assaulted, and many could never work again. This week, a retired officer, Michael Fanone, told Rhodes to go fuck himself live on CNN , and said he was worried for his safety and that of his family. Fanone is surely not alone. I think of the hundreds of D.C. citizens who served as jurors in January 6 cases that are now overturned, and the judges who presided over them.\n\nWhen he sentenced Taylor Johnatakis, Judge Royce Lamberth wrote: \"Political violence rots republics. Therefore, January 6 must not become a precedent for further violence against political opponents or governmental institutions.\" Lamberth, who is 81 and whose wife died a few months ago, had a couple of new January 6 cases due to start this week, a father and son, but they have disappeared from the docket. In his sentencing letter for Johnatakis's case, he wrote, \"This is not normal.\" I wanted to ask him about the pardons but did not get a response from his office.\n\nIn our conversation, Marie Johnatakis referred to Lamberth as one of the \"sweet judges,\" and she meant it earnestly. I've known her for more than a year, and she is a gentle person. But her critique of him, although kindly delivered, is a radical one. She compared Lamberth to Javert, the prosecutor in Les Miserables . In her view, the judge is so rigidly attached to the law that he can't see the deeper truth, which is that a good man like her husband should not have gone to jail.\n\nShe and Taylor fly home today. The kids, she told me, will be making them dinner.\n\nArticle originally published at The Atlantic"

But, he says, \"Somebody just passed it to me, and heavily coerced me to take those two hits.\"\n\n\"I hosted a really good party,\" Mr. Fellows says of his Jan. 6 actions, adding, \"Unfortunately, the FBI felt differently about it.\"\n\nTo critics, adulation for convicted rioters is anathema to a civilized society. But participants in the nightly Jan. 6 vigils see a miscarriage of justice that they hope will be righted when President-elect Donald Trump takes office.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department , Mr. Fellows entered the Capitol building through a broken window, then \"paraded\" through a door holding a Trump 2020 flag. He was sentenced to 42 months - including five months for contempt over repeated outbursts during his trial - and was released from prison in May. Now, the former chimney repairman from Schenectady, New York, has become a regular presence at nightly vigils taking place outside the D.C. Central Detention Facility, where he was once held.\n\nOn a frigid January night, Mr. Fellows was one of 10 people gathered outside the jail to support those still inside - about 20 prisoners, they say - for their participation in the Capitol riot. Prisoners can look out the window and see the vigil, flashing the indoor lights to signal their appreciation. Every night, a few are able to call a participant's cellphone, which is amplified to the crowd via loudspeaker.\n\nIt's a tight-knit, eclectic group that includes Micki Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt, a Jan. 6 rioter who was shot dead by a Capitol Police officer; a military veteran known as 1791 Storm Trooper, who livestreams the nightly vigil; a retired Army medic who also runs a livestream; and several congregants from a local Chinese Christian church, including a retired federal employee named Dwight Yen.\n\nMs. Witthoeft started the nightly vigils on Aug. 1, 2022, after she says her daughter spoke to her in a dream.\n\nNearly 900 days later, she and other participants remain united in their belief that the 2020 election was stolen and that U.S. government oppression continues. Just two miles from the Capitol, these nightly gatherings reflect the intense devotion to Donald Trump shown by his most ardent supporters, which helped fuel the former president's successful bid in November to take back the White House.\n\nTo law enforcement officers injured in the Jan. 6 mayhem, as well as members of Congress and others present in the Capitol that day who feared for their lives, such adulation for convicted rioters is not only misguided but also anathema to a civilized society.\n\n\"If January 6th was a day of love,\" as President-elect Trump has said, \"then MAGA extremists nearly loved me to death,\" said retired Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell at a web event last week marking the fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nSergeant Gonell has spoken out and written a book about the abuse he endured that day, including being hit with a flagpole and beaten by his own baton. More than 140 police officers were injured in the riot, and one died the next day of \"natural causes,\" according to the D.C. medical examiner. Four others died by suicide in the days and months after the riot.\n\nBut vigil participants are counting the days until Jan. 20, when Mr. Trump becomes president again. He has promised to pardon most, if not all , of the so-called J6ers.\n\nIncoming Vice President JD Vance said Sunday on Fox News that those who committed violence \"obviously\" should not be pardoned . But expectations are high. Nearly 1,600 people were charged federally in connection with the riot.\n\nWhat if Mr. Trump doesn't pardon everybody?\n\n\"There's a good chance the vigils will continue,\" says Sherri Hafner, the retired Army medic who livestreams the nightly gatherings.\n\nMs. Hafner says she wasn't at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and doesn't know anyone who was. She was protesting with a different \"freedom movement,\" she says, for 34 days on the National Mall to \"address our grievances to the government.\" Then she heard about the nightly vigils, right as they started, and joined up.\n\nShe says she heard that many of those held here were decorated combat veterans. \"I took an oath never to leave a man behind. I consider these guys my brothers,\" says Ms. Hafner, a combat veteran herself.\n\nMs. Hafner also participated in a commemorative Jan. 6 march around the fence surrounding the Capitol last week. She handed out flowers to be laid at the fence in honor of Ms. Babbitt. Counterprotesters shouted epithets as they walked by, but the opposing groups kept it nonviolent.\n\nA leader of that march, Nicole Reffitt, is another organizer of the jailhouse vigils and the wife of J6er Guy Reffitt, a member of the antigovernment Three Percenter militia from Texas, who's now incarcerated in Missouri, according to his wife. He carried a gun to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and was reported to the authorities by his son - a family drama that has been widely publicized . Mr. Reffitt did not enter the Capitol that day, but helped incite the crowd \"into an unstoppable force,\" a prosecutor said at his 2022 trial.\n\nIn an interview on Christmas Eve, when this reporter first visited the scene outside the D.C. jail, Ms. Reffitt paused as she sought to explain the message participants were trying to send by being out there, day after day.\n\n\"You know, really, I hope that it gives other people some courage. The J6 communities have gone through a lot. [It's been] very polarizing,\" Ms. Reffitt said. She hopes it \"gives some community, some fellowship, encouragement.\"\n\nOn that particular holiday eve, when about 20 people were gathered, the atmosphere was almost festive. A table was laden with food, a potluck organized by the Chinese church group.\n\nThe nightly rituals are structured in some ways like a religious service. The Pledge of Allegiance is recited. Prayers are offered. Over a sound system, the names of still-incarcerated J6ers are read aloud, and prisoners call vigil organizers from inside the D.C. jail to convey messages to their supporters. A recording of the chart-topping \"Jan. 6 Prison Chorus\" singing the National Anthem, with an overlay of Mr. Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, is played.\n\nMr. Fellows, the former J6 prisoner, wasn't there on Christmas Eve, but was happy to talk during the vigil on Jan. 8.\n\nIs he expecting a pardon? Actually, he'd prefer a commutation, saying he wants to appeal his convictions. Looking ahead, Mr. Fellows is hoping to move to New Jersey and rebuild his chimney repair business. He says he's thinking about joining a militia, both for the sense of community and for protection, in an increasingly unstable world.\n\n\"Being in a militia can be beneficial,\" Mr. Fellows says, his red MAGA cap backward on his head. \"You can join together, make a little neighborhood to protect yourselves, work on little projects together.\"\n\n\"If it all crumbles - which some people say could happen...,\" he continues, his voice trailing off. \"Rome fell. Every empire's fallen. We'll eventually fall, too.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

As in his first term, Mr. Trump is directing the country to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which involves commitments to lower greenhouse gas emissions, and to leave the World Health Organization.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a historic number of executive orders on Day 1. Here's what he did - or so far avoided - that reflects his priorities for the economy, U.S. borders, and social policies.\n\nThe executive orders will \"begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense,\" said Mr. Trump during his inaugural address.\n\nLegal challenges are likely on a variety of fronts, including over his efforts to limit birthright citizenship. On Monday, immigrant advocates sued Mr. Trump over that order, asking a federal court in New Hampshire to declare it unconstitutional. On Tuesday, 18 state attorneys general also sued the president over this issue.\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration\n\nCongress creates immigration law, but presidents have shaped policy through executive action. Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border Monday, which directs the military to assist with Homeland Security operations, the construction of more border barriers, and the denial of illegal entries.\n\n\"All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\"\n\nThe Biden administration recorded historically high levels of illegal migration. Despite repeatedly calling out an immigrant \"invasion,\" however, Mr. Trump resumes office as Border Patrol encounters with unauthorized immigrants at the southern border are down - and lower than when he left office in 2021. Border Patrol encounters, a proxy for illegal border crossings, stood around 47,300 in December. There were 71,100 encounters in December 2020, Mr. Trump's last full month, by comparison.\n\nThe administration is also reinstating a former Trump policy known as Remain in Mexico. The order makes migrants seeking asylum in the U.S. wait in Mexico ahead of their immigration court dates. Immigrant advocates decried the policy, arguing it left asylum-seekers stranded in dangerous conditions in Mexico. Mr. Trump has also ordered the end of using a mobile app, CBP One, for initial appointments at official ports of entry that can result in migrants lawfully being let in through parole. The new administration is also ending parole programs for certain nationalities, including Venezuelans.\n\nThrough another executive order , Mr. Trump seeks to withhold birthright citizenship from children born to unauthorized immigrants. He attempts this by upending a longstanding interpretation of the 14th Amendment , and directing the government not to issue or recognize documents that would affirm citizenship against Mr. Trump's new reading. (That policy begins with children born in the U.S. starting in 30 days.) Critics, including many legal scholars, say that Mr. Trump's change would require action from beyond the White House - essentially a major Supreme Court ruling or a constitutional amendment.\n\nIllegal immigration isn't his only target, however. The president is also curtailing a longstanding legal pathway by temporarily suspending refugee resettlement as of Jan. 27. Unlike asylum-seekers, refugees are approved for protection in the U.S. before they arrive, and are heavily vetted.\n\nCiting local bandwidth and security concerns, the order says refugees would be \"detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" The U.S. admitted just over 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the most in three decades.\n\nMr. Trump is pursuing \"exactly what he promised,\" says Gabriel Chin, an immigration law scholar at the University of California, Davis School of Law. While significant legal pushback is expected, and curbing birthright citizenship is a \"heavy lift,\" he says, Mr. Trump does have \"a lot of authority over the border.\"\n\nEver since he burst onto the political scene, President Trump has upset political norms and remade the GOP in his image. But bending the economy to his will may prove more difficult. The laws of economics keep getting in the way.\n\nTake tariffs - a signature issue for the president. On his first day in office, he declined to impose the new tariffs on allies and adversaries that he had been hinting at for months. Instead, he signed an executive order to study the issue and voiced more threats for China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nAt some point, he will have to make clear where his tariffs will fall and how comprehensive they'll be, so that international supply chains can adjust. Tariffs would make imported products more expensive, hitting U.S. consumers and companies alike.\n\nThe administration hopes that companies will avoid possible tariffs by moving manufacturing to the United States and boosting jobs. But some consumer goods are so low-cost that firms would find it impossible to turn a profit using high-priced American workers. If the administration issues blanket tariffs, then consumers will end up paying more for washing machines, cars, and everyday goods such as toys and T-shirts.\n\nIn similar fashion, the law of supply and demand complicates Mr. Trump's immigration policies. His deportation moves, if successful, would substantially reduce the 8 million workforce of immigrants estimated to be in the United States illegally. A smaller supply of workers will lead to higher wages, if demand remains the same. That's welcome news for low-skill, low-paid native workers hit hard by more than 40 years of free-trade policy. The tradeoff is that higher pay will mean higher costs for businesses and consumers still struggling with the surge in prices during the previous administration.\n\nIn both cases, higher prices pose a political danger for Mr. Trump. Americans who voted against the Democrats because of inflation during the Biden administration may do the same to congressional Republicans in 2026 if inflation begins climbing again.\n\nIn a third area, the law of supply and demand could help the new president. On Monday, he declared a national energy emergency and issued executive orders aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling and bringing down energy prices. More supply should bring down gasoline and other energy prices. How much is an open question, analysts say. Prices are already low, and drillers are cutting the number of oil and natural gas rigs. Will they drill more if prices go even lower?\n\nFollowing through on a campaign promise, Mr. Trump issued pardons for over 1,000 criminal defendants charged in relation to the Jan. 6, 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol. He also commuted the sentences of 14 people who were convicted or charged with seditious conspiracy in relation to the event.\n\nSince his re-election, the so-called \"J6ers\" had eagerly awaited pardons from Mr. Trump. The following months had brought mixed signals, however. Mr. Trump had declined to confirm if only those convicted of misdemeanors would be pardoned or violent offenders as well. Vice President JD Vance said last week that Jan. 6 defendants responsible for violence \"obviously\" would not be pardoned, though he later walked those comments back.\n\nNow the answer has arrived: \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon\" for all individuals \"convicted of offenses related to\" Jan. 6. This includes over 200 people who pleaded guilty to felonies, including Julian Khater, who pleaded guilty to assaulting police officers with a dangerous weapon, and Robert Palmer, who pleaded guilty to the same charge after attacking police officers with a wooden plank and a fire extinguisher.\n\nThe 14 commutations reduce sentences for a number of leaders of far-right extremist groups. Stewart Rhodes, a founder of the Oath Keepers militia group, had his 18-year prison sentence commuted. Jessica Watkins, an Oath Keeper who described herself at her sentencing as \"just another idiot running around the Capitol,\" saw her 8.5-year sentence commuted. Enrique Tarrio, the founder of the Proud Boys militia group, was being processed for release from prison tonight, NBC News reported .\n\n\"Tomorrow everybody...will be very happy with my decision on the J6 hostages,\" Trump teased at a post-inauguration rally on Monday night.\n\nMr. Trump also signed two executive orders his administration labeled as \"restoring common sense\" to the country.\n\nOne order targets recent cultural conflicts over transgender rights and sex classifications. The directive broadly instructs federal agencies to enforce laws in a way that treats men and women as biologically distinct sexes, and ensure that federal funds are not spent promoting \"gender ideology,\" according to an incoming White House official. \"It is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female,\" the order reads.\n\nSpecifically, the executive order will reverse a policy that saw taxpayer money subsidize sex transition procedures for transgender federal inmates. Per the order, federal documents like passports and visas will be required to reflect the holder's biological sex.\n\nAnother order being signed by Mr. Trump will roll back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, policies, and positions in the federal government.\n\nMr. Biden issued his own set of executive orders upon entering the White House that instructed federal agencies to improve their hiring of minorities and women. His administration also prioritized tackling systemic inequities, such as \"environmental justice\" initiatives that sought to address poor air and water quality that disproportionately affects minority communities.\n\nThe Trump administration, describing these programs and policies as expensive and ineffective, will be rolling them back. President Trump will \"end the onslaught of useless and overpaid DEI activists buried into the federal workforce,\" according to guidance his administration shared with members of Congress.\n\nHow effective the order will be is unclear, however. There are 2.2 million federal civilian employees, and the majority are subject to strict civil service regulations .\n\n\"He doesn't really have control over [many] employees. But there's a lot of symbolism here,\" says Norma Riccucci, a professor at Rutgers University who studies the federal workforce.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

When his story is fully told, it will be for ushering in a new era that upended American life, both politically and culturally.\n\nIt's a chilly Christmas Eve, and about 20 people are standing outside the Washington jail, taking part in the nightly vigil supporting those still being held here for their actions on that day. What does Ms. Witthoeft expect from President-elect Trump when he takes office again Jan. 20?\n\n\"I believe he will keep his word, and he will start the process to either commute sentences or pardon people,\" Ms. Witthoeft says. She began the vigils Aug. 1, 2022, after \"Ashli talked to me in my dream.\"\n\nThat the nightly protests have lasted nearly 900 days is a testament to the participants' passionate support for those sometimes known as J6ers. And they're but one example of how Mr. Trump - even out of office - has been a uniquely dominant force in American public life since the day in June 2015 he rode down the golden escalator in Trump Tower to announce his run for president.\n\nBy then, Mr. Trump was already famous as a New York real estate developer and reality TV personality. But when his story is fully told, it will be for ushering in a new era that has upended American life, both politically and culturally.\n\nIronically, by losing his first bid for reelection in 2020 - making way for a four-year \"interregnum\" with President Joe Biden, and then pulling off the first nonconsecutive presidential reelection since Grover Cleveland in 1892 - Mr. Trump has extended his public dominance by four years.\n\nAt the launch of his second term, political analysts say, the stakes are even higher than when he took office eight years ago.\n\n\"The times are more fraught globally and more fraught economically,\" says Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University. \"The divisions and level of rancor and vitriol and political violence have intensified since he was first in office.\"\n\nLast summer's two assassination attempts on Mr. Trump are high-profile examples. So, too, is the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street in December. Several top Trump appointees have faced bomb threats, according to the president-elect's transition team. Overall, threats against public officials have risen over the past decade.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. Trump has stayed in the public spotlight virtually nonstop since losing reelection in 2020, claiming repeatedly and falsely that the election was stolen, and then staging an improbable comeback in November. A clear example of Mr. Trump's dominance came a year ago - well before clinching the 2024 nomination - when he lobbied successfully to kill a bipartisan Senate deal on immigration, effectively holding on to the issue for his campaign.\n\nThe various criminal and civil cases against him also kept him in the headlines, and may well have helped him win last November as he cried legal persecution. With Mr. Trump now poised to become the 47th president, most of those cases have evaporated.\n\nIt is within this atmosphere of ferment that long-simmering talk on the left of a potential \"Trump dictatorship\" persists. Mr. Trump himself seems to revel in the speculation, telling Fox News late in 2023 that he wouldn't be a dictator if elected again - \"except on Day 1.\"\n\nIndeed, the opening act of the Trump sequel promises to be momentous. The president-elect has said the message of his second inaugural will be \"unity\" - a sharp departure, if true, from the dystopian picture of \"American carnage\" he painted in his first.\n\nNext will come dozens of executive actions - at once typical for a new president, and in Mr. Trump's case, expected to reflect the transformative intent of the second term. Beyond the anticipated pardons of J6ers, other measures include the closing of the U.S.-Mexico border, the start of mass deportations of unauthorized migrants, the removal of job protections for thousands of federal employees, and expanded oil drilling. ( Explore more Trump promises for Day 1 .)\n\nWhen asked how the second term will differ from the first, a Trump insider - speaking not for attribution so as to speak freely - puts it this way: \"He knows what he's doing. This time around, it's not just pie in the sky.\"\n\nIn fact, the shock and awe of Trump 2.0 began soon after Election Day. A string of highly controversial Cabinet picks consumed public discourse. Matt Gaetz, a now-former Florida congressman and Trump loyalist, withdrew from consideration for attorney general amid serious ethics concerns, including reports (later detailed in a House Ethics Committee report) of paying for sex with a minor and of drug use.\n\nMr. Trump's aggressive posture toward the mainstream media is perhaps just a foretaste of his pledge to seek \"retribution\" and prosecute so-called enemies, including President Biden, special counsel Jack Smith, and former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney.\n\nIn December, he settled a defamation lawsuit against ABC News and George Stephanopoulos for $15 million, after the host inaccurately stated that Mr. Trump had been \"found liable for rape\" in a civil case. Another lawsuit, against the Des Moines Register and others over a preelection poll that showed him losing in Iowa, will at a minimum cost the defendants in legal fees, if not have a chilling effect on less wealthy outlets going forward.\n\nDuring an eight-week period before the election, Mr. Trump attacked the media publicly more than 100 times, according to the group Reporters Without Borders.\n\nAnother eyebrow-raising episode came in late December, when Mr. Trump revived the first-term idea of having the United States buy Greenland, a territory of Denmark - and of reclaiming control over the Panama Canal, which the U.S. began to cede to Panama in 1977. Such headline-grabbers may be just talk, designed to create leverage toward other goals. Indeed, Mr. Trump's suggestion that Canada become the 51st state is widely seen as a joke, albeit one aimed at trolling the U.S.'s northern neighbor as the president-elect threatens tariffs. But at the very least, all the expansive suggestions present Mr. Trump as an empire-builder, astride the world stage.\n\nMore central to Trump 2.0 has been the rise of world's-richest-man Elon Musk as both a sidekick and a governing force. Before the holidays, it was Mr. Musk who led the charge in Congress, via his own social platform X, killing the first attempt at a compromise bill to keep the government funded - hours before Mr. Trump weighed in. A later bill passed, averting a shutdown.\n\nMr. Musk so dominated the shutdown narrative that critics dubbed the duo \"President-elect Musk\" and \"Vice President-elect Trump.\" The actual president, Mr. Biden, has receded publicly as he approaches retirement.\n\nMr. Musk's stated role in the second Trump term is to co-lead, along with entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a new advisory commission called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The intent is to recommend massive cuts in the federal bureaucracy and regulations.\n\nBut Mr. Musk has also been more than just an adviser to Mr. Trump. He's effectively become part of the Trump family, taking part in phone calls with world leaders, reportedly weighing in on Cabinet choices, and often appearing with Mr. Trump at his Florida estate and at public events.\n\nCan the bromance last? It's impossible to say. A schism within the MAGA movement has emerged over the South African-native Mr. Musk's support for granting visas to skilled foreign workers. Die-hard Trump supporters oppose all types of immigration. Late in December, Mr. Trump suggested support for H-1B visas for immigrant workers, but the issue remains an open question.\n\nFor now, the Musk factor looms large. The DOGE king's megaphone is arguably as big as Mr. Trump's, given the multibillionaire's social media, and he has a much vaster bank account. Mr. Musk has also made clear he'll deploy his cash in the 2026 midterms to take on Republican members of Congress who defy the president.\n\nThe rise and return of Mr. Trump haven't happened in a vacuum. The world over, populists and strongmen have come to power amid continuing postpandemic economic disruption, increasing inequality, and growing anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nDavid M. Kennedy, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian at Stanford University, remembers the words of President George W. Bush in an Oval Office meeting with scholars back in 2006.\n\n\"'There are three things happening in this country that really bother me, and I'd like to hear your perspective: isolationism, protectionism, and nativism,'\" Professor Kennedy recalls President Bush saying.\n\n\"Well, here we are, 18, 19 years later, and you could name the same three items today,\" Dr. Kennedy says.\n\nBut the Stanford scholar suggests that the idea of the U.S. sliding toward authoritarian rule is a stretch.\n\n\"The great preoccupation of the founders was the containment of power - the power of the legislature, the power of the executive, the power of the courts,\" Dr. Kennedy says. \"They built a system to guarantee that too much power would never end up in one place.\"\n\nHistorian Tevi Troy, a senior aide in the second Bush White House, says he doesn't see Mr. Trump as a \"dictator,\" instead pointing to a trend toward greater presidential power that began well before the Trump era.\n\n\"Congress has just ceded power over the past 20 years, and presidents have accumulated power as Congress cedes it,\" says Mr. Troy, a senior fellow at the Ronald Reagan Institute.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump's ability to enact his agenda will have its limits. Elements that need to go through the newly seated House of Representatives will face the smallest margin of control in modern history, with just a four-seat Republican majority after the resignation of Mr. Gaetz. And the Senate is far from the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, with a 53-47 Republican majority. The new GOP Senate leadership has promised to keep the filibuster in place.\n\nActions by Mr. Trump that wind up in federal court could well face a Biden-appointed judge; the president gained confirmation of a record 235 federal judges during his term. The Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority can be expected to help Mr. Trump, but offers no guarantees.\n\nJulia Azari, a political scientist at Marquette University in Wisconsin, also sees limits to the idea of absolute Trump rule, given the closely divided Congress. And despite Mr. Trump's claims of a mandate, his victory last fall was not a sweep. He fell just short of a majority of the popular vote.\n\n\"The political minority is setting the agenda, and that sets us up for very deeply contentious politics,\" Professor Azari says. That is true not just in partisan terms, but also demographically, she says, noting Mr. Trump's inroads into both the Hispanic and Black communities.\n\nUltimately, she says, \"Trump has created a political environment in which, even when he hasn't commanded a national majority, people have to respond to him.\"\n\nLinda Jew is \"overjoyed\" by the 2024 election result.\n\n\"I said prayers every night for Donald Trump that he would be our president again,\" says the Republican from Parker, Colorado.\n\nMs. Jew can trace her family back to a Chinese merchant who arrived in the 1800s. Now, in the city's latest immigration chapter, Denver has tracked the arrival of nearly 43,000 migrants since late 2022. At home in Parker, some 20 miles south, Ms. Jew says illegal immigration is a chief concern. She doesn't like how federal funds have been spent on migrants, including for temporary shelters.\n\n\"Biden is just giving away all our money\" to unauthorized immigrants, she says. \"And not helping the American citizens.\"\n\nNewsmax, Tucker Carlson, and Steve Bannon help her make sense of a changing world; she's watched her state in recent decades trend from red to purple to blue. She says Mr. Trump's campaign stop in Aurora, where he pledged to crack down on \"migrant crime,\" made her feel less alone.\n\nThe retired dental hygienist recalls one patient, years ago, scolding her for being conservative. He told her she was supposed to be a Democrat - as a woman and minority.\n\n\"You just reduced me to a stereotype,\" she recalls replying. The man's assumption cemented her beliefs all the more.\n\nStill, it's hard to talk with loved ones who disagree. Like the time a family member called Mr. Trump \"Hitler\" over the phone. Ms. Jew hung up. But that didn't feel right. So she called back.\n\nFarther west, in San Francisco, Kimberley Rodler is also still processing the election that was. During the campaign, the architect-turned-art-teacher traded in years of frequent flyer miles to travel to battleground states, from Nevada to Michigan to Pennsylvania, and canvass for the Democratic ticket. This reporter met her last fall in Florida, where abortion rights were on the ballot.\n\nIn all, Ms. Rodler says later on the phone, she knocked on 2,460 doors, and has no regrets - not that she loved every interaction. She recalls canvassing in Nevada the day of the Trump assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I was confronted at two doors by Trump supporters with guns,\" Ms. Rodler says. \"I was wearing a Biden-Harris T-shirt or button, and this woman comes up and says, 'Five minutes, if you're not off my property, you're shot!'\"\n\nNow Ms. Rodler is immersing herself in poetry and art, clinging to happier memories from the campaign, like the first-time voters she met who were grateful to be heard.\n\n\"I saw so much of the beauty of the people,\" she says. \"We are neighbors; we are civil people.\"\n\nPolls, in fact, show that Americans share much common ground, at least on issues if not on candidates. A preelection survey in six battleground states and nationally by the University of Maryland found bipartisan consensus on a range of issues - from the cost of living to reproductive rights to the border.\n\nStill, the nation's closely divided politics promise to make enacting the Trump agenda more difficult than he has suggested at times, from reducing inflation and cutting taxes to fixing the broken immigration system. As Inauguration Day approached, Mr. Trump sought to tamp down expectations.\n\nFor decadeslong Trump observers, this is a moment to take stock. Looking back to his days as a publicity-minded Manhattan businessman and reality TV performer, few could imagine the historic figure he'd become.\n\nWhen Gwenda Blair was writing her 2000 book chronicling three generations of the Trump family, she says she grasped that Donald Trump had \"a really acute understanding of American culture, politics, economics, the whole schmear, and was acutely laser-focused on what a large number of people really felt and really wanted to hear.\"\n\n\"He is a consummate salesman,\" says Ms. Blair. And in Mr. Trump's final campaign, she says, she saw an understanding of the American psyche that has reached \"a whole other cellular level.\"\n\nBack at the Washington Central Detention Facility on Christmas Eve, the mood outside on the sidewalk dubbed \"Freedom Corner\" is hopeful, even festive. Mr. Trump is about to retake office, and one of those imprisoned expresses optimism in a call to a participant's cellphone, amplified for the assembled supporters to hear.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe January 6 rioters who received pardons from Donald Trump have a message for the new president.\n\n\"I'm thankful for promises that were made, promises that were kept,\" Isabella Maria DeLuca, a 24-year-old social media influencer charged in the Capitol attack, told Newsweek on Tuesday. \"When so many Republicans were turning their back on J6ers, he wasn't.\"\n\nHours after taking office on Monday, Trump pardoned roughly 1,500 of his supporters who were charged in connection to the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot, and commuted the remaining 14 prison sentences. The move, which went beyond the scope many were expecting, was a major blow to the sweeping federal prosecution that began more than four years ago when thousands of people stormed to the Capitol in an effort to overturn his 2020 election loss.\n\nFlexing his clemency powers, Trump sought to rewrite that narrative on his first day back at the White House, casting the rioters as \"patriots\" and \"hostages\" who were unfairly prosecuted by a politically-motivated Justice Department.\n\nDeLuca, who was facing misdemeanor charges, including theft of government property, disorderly conduct and entering a restricted area, told Newsweek she was out for dinner with her sister and friends when she received a message from her lawyer that all of his January 6 clients had received full pardons from Trump.\n\n\"My immediate reaction was just shock and relief and happy tears,\" DeLuca said. \"To have the weight of the government and all its resources on you as a 24-year-old who's just getting their life started, it weighs heavily on you. And so, this has been a huge relief. I feel vindicated. I feel like I have my life back.\"\n\nTaylor James Johnatakis was serving out his 87-month sentence at a federal prison in Springfield, Missouri when the news came down.\n\n\"I feel relieved,\" Johnatakis told Newsweek on Tuesday. \"I feel very grateful to President Trump for making good on his word. There's some people who didn't think he would keep his word, but we never doubted he would. I'm very glad he did what he did; we couldn't be more grateful to him.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors said Johnatakis marched alongside the pro-Trump mob to the Capitol, and that once he made it to the west side of the building he used a megaphone to encourage fellow rioters to overpower a police line. He then organized and coordinated other rioters to assault police officers at the top of a staircase, court documents show.\n\n\"Johnatakis was not just any rioter: he led, organized, and encouraged the assault of officers at the U.S. Capitol on January 6,\" prosecutors said.\n\nJohnatakis, who was arrested in Washington state by the FBI in February 2021, was convicted in April of three felonies and four misdemeanor charges, including assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers. He was also ordered to pay $2,000 in restitution. He had served 14 months of his sentence at the time his pardon was issued.\n\n\"To say I assaulted [the police officers] does disservice to the word assault,\" Johnatakis said Tuesday. \"The case is what the case is, but I've been pardoned.\"\n\nUpon his release from MCFP Springfield, Johnatakis and his wife Marie stopped at Walmart to get new clothes and grab lunch at a diner before returning home to their family in Kingston, Washington. The father of five said he \"told everybody from the checkout person to the waiter at the diner to the person at the gas station: 'I just out of federal prison, I'm a January 6th defendant, and I just got pardoned.'\"\n\n\"Not one single person hasn't been supportive of us,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Johnatakis had anticipated that Trump would move quickly to pardon those charged in connection to the Capitol riot, there were moments when he was unsure if he would ever get out early.\n\n\"As soon as Donald Trump got elected, everybody knew that we were getting out,\" he recalled. \"I mean, guards were giving us high fives, other inmates were like, 'You guys are getting out, don't worry.' We were way more nervous about just how dirty politics is and worried that we would continue to be fodder for the nature of politics.\"\n\nJohnatakis wasn't the only one who had doubts.\n\n\"With something as big as a federal case against you, there's always kind of this little voice in the back of your head that's like, 'Well, what if he isn't pardoning everybody?' DeLuca said. \"Getting the news that I received a full pardon, I just basically had tears of joy because I wasn't expecting it so soon.\"\n\nDeLuca, who had not been convicted at the time her pardon was issued, acknowledged that there were defendants who had it \"way worse,\" having been in jails for years. She said she also suffered from the events of that day.\n\n\"I did lose my job. I did come into financial trouble because of this. I had a really great job lined up that was basically taken from me because of the case. I was humiliated. My family was humiliated. I was labeled by a thief by my own government, a domestic terrorist. And so it was very difficult, and it feels nice to not have any of that weighing on me.\"\n\nThe Setauket, New York native, who has more than 469,000 followers on X, formerly Twitter , previously interned for former Representative Lee Zeldin and Representative Paul Gosar , both Republican allies of Trump. Zeldin is expected to be confirmed as Trump's next Environmental Protection Agency administrator.\n\nAsked if she would have gone to the Capitol that day knowing what would have transpired, the 24-year-old influencer said, \"Probably not.\"\n\nDeLuca is looking forward to rebuilding her life, both professionally and personally, but Johnatakis expressed a more dreary outlook on what lies ahead. A septic systems installer before he went to prison, Johnatakis said he was uncertain if his career was still waiting for him at home.\n\n\"To my knowledge, that's gone,\" he said. \"This destroys your life. We had to sell basically every asset we own just for my five kids to survive. We tried to sell the house, unfortunately the house never sold. I guess fortunately now, because at least I have a home to go back to - it's about the only thing left.\"\n\nJohnatakis said he had to sell his work equipment and truck while imprisoned and needs to reassess his next move.\n\n\"My licenses have all lapsed, so am I going to go back to septic? I have no idea,\" he said. \"I have no idea what's waiting for me going home other than my family, which is the most important thing.\"\n\nBut not all the defendants who received pardons from Trump had the same message. Pam Hemphill, who was also known as \"MAGA granny,\" told Newsweek she wouldn't be accepting the pardon.\n\n\"Taking a pardon would be taking a part of what January 6 has been trying to do, which is rewrite history. [To say] that [the Capitol riot] was a peaceful protest and the DOJ was weaponized against them. And I'm not going to play a part of that,\" Hemphill said Tuesday. \"I pleaded guilty because I was guilty.\"\n\nShe said those disputing the prosecutions are \"lying\" and \"grifting.\"\n\n\"The courts have a sentencing guideline. Some [defendants] have even gotten lesser sentences than the prosecutors recommended. Some got what they were recommended, but it's all been under the law,\" she said. \"It's been very professionally done, legally done, but they're not telling you that story. They're going to tell you the total of it all lies, every single one of them.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek senior reporter based in New York City.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed pardons on January 20, 2025, granting clemency to over 1,500 individuals convicted or charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. These pardons were issued by Executive Order on the same day Trump signed a total of 26 Executive Orders.\n\nImages circulating online (taken from the Federal Register, a branch of the National Archives) have led some social media users to speculate that the president used an autopen rather than signing them by hand.\n\nThis follows Trump declaring on Truth Social that President Joe Biden's preemptive pardons for the January 6 Committee are \"void,\" because of his belief that Biden signed those pardons with an autopen.\n\nThe Claim\n\nA post on X (formerly Twitter ), which has been viewed more than 3 million times, accused Trump of signing the January 6 pardons with an autopen.\n\nThe post includes images of the Federal Register's publicly available version of the pardons and says: \"Sorry J6ers. All of your 1000+ pardons were done with autopen.\"\n\nSorry J6ers. All of your 1000+ pardons were done with autopen. 🤭 pic.twitter.com/N98jUFGr3L\n\nSocial media users have seized upon these images to allege that Trump is being hypocritical for declaring Biden's pardons \"void, vacant and of no further effect,\" while ostensibly using an autopen himself.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe documents people are referring to are copies of the presidential pardons listed on the Federal Register . The Federal Register publishes copies of presidential documents, not original documents, on its website.\n\nCommunications staff at the National Archives told fact-checking site Snopes: \"At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President's signature to the Office of the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register.\"\n\nTrump's January 6 pardons, where he pardoned over 1,500 individuals convicted or charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, including some involved in violent confrontations with police officers, were signed by Executive Order on January 20, 2025.\n\nThe President signed a total of 26 Executive Orders that day, and there is news footage of him signing those documents.\n\nTrump has accused Biden of using an autopen to sign pardons for the January 6 Committee, Dr. Anthony Fauci , Generals Mark Milley and Jerry Lundergan, and his son, Hunter Biden . Trump has further claimed that Biden was neither physically nor mentally present to sign the pardons. However, no evidence has been presented to support this claim.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump's documents display autopen signatures online, not because they were signed by autopen, but because the Federal Register archives them with a graphic signature.\n\nEven if the pardons were signed with an autopen it would make no legal difference. The Justice Department (DOJ) in 2005 stated : \"The President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.\"\n\nDonald Trump told reporters yesterday that he has used an autopen for \"only very unimportant papers\" such as letters.\n\nThe Ruling\n\nFalse.\n\nThe images being circulated of Donald Trump's January 6 pardons have an autopen signature because they are Federal Register copies.

It's so surreal,\" Edward Jacob \"Jake\" Lang, who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and was arrested in the same month, told Newsweek on Wednesday, the same day Trump was elected president for a second time. \"Hollywood couldn't have written a better story.\"\n\nLang, who was 25 at the time of the Capitol riots, is accused of wielding a dangerous weapon against Capitol Police officers and obstruction of an official proceeding. Footage from the riot shows him swatting a bat at Capitol Police officers \"multiple times,\" according to an FBI affidavit from January 15, 2021. Lang, who describes himself as a political prisoner, is still awaiting trial.\n\nIn a post published on X on Wednesday, Lang celebrated Trump's victory as his time to go home. \"I'M COMING HOME!!!!

Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt previously said his administration would decide \"on a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House.\"\n\nAmong those federally charged in connection with the storming of the Capitol, over 500 were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding police; some 1,000 have pleaded guilty or were found guilty during trial.\n\nThe longest sentence was handed to former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who was given 22 years in prison for orchestrating a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden . David Nicholas Dempsey, who repeatedly attacked Capitol Police officers with flagpoles and other makeshift weapons on January 6, 2021, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in August this year.\n\nThe Trump campaign has not excluded any rioters, including the most violent like Tarrio and Dempsey, from possibly being pardoned.

He is due to be sentenced on May 3.\n\n\"He loves God,\" McBride said in an interview last month following the conviction. \"He loves his country. He understands he did something wrong. He doesn't think his life should end because he put his feet up on somebody's desk .\"\n\nMcBride's reference to the FBI and Catholics in his Friday social media postings appear to refer to a recently leaked internal memo that was written last month from the FBI's Richmond Field Office that linked \"'racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists\" with a \"radical-traditionalist Catholic' ideology.\"\n\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, chairman of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB)'s Committee for Religious Liberty issued a statement about the memo on Thursday where he agreed with another Catholic bishop that the memo was \"troubling and offensive\" including \"in its religious profiling and reliance on dubious sourcing.\"\n\n\"We encourage federal law enforcement authorities to take appropriate measures to ensure the problematic aspects of the memo do not recur in any of their agencies' work going forward,\" Dolan said, who added that he was glad that the document had already been rescinded.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI issued a statement on February 9, saying: \"Upon learning of the document, FBI Headquarters quickly began taking action to remove the document from FBI systems and conduct a review of the basis for the document.\"\n\n\"The FBI is committed to sound analytic tradecraft and to investigating and preventing acts of violence and other crimes while upholding the constitutional rights of all Americans and will never conduct investigative activities or open an investigation based solely on First Amendment protected activity,\" the bureau added.\n\nNewsweek has asked the Department of Justice (DOJ) for comment.\n\nDarragh Roche is a U.S. News Reporter based in Limerick, Ireland.

Prior to joining Newsweek he was with The Hollywood Reporter . He has also written for USA Today , The Los Angeles Times and more. He began his career as a crime reporter and today he covers culture, politics, entertainment and business, focusing on telling stories oftentimes ignored by mainstream reporters.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide this month the fate of roughly 350 people convicted of or charged with obstruction for trespassing in and around the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021, while members of the House and Senate were certifying the vote count of the Electoral College.\n\nThe case, Fischer v. United States , is centered around the use of Section 1512(c)(2), enacted in the aftermath of the 2001 Enron accounting scandal and usually applied to destroying evidence and witness tampering, though the law also makes it a crime to otherwise obstruct, influence or impede any official proceeding.\n\nThe outcome will certainly affect the case against Donald Trump . Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was indicted on four counts, including 1512(c)(2), in August by Special Counsel Jack Smith stemming from his alleged role in the Capitol riot.\n\nBut as cameras follow Trump's every move, many far more anonymous Americans without the wealth and power of a former president are on pins and needles hoping the High Court sides with Joseph Fischer.\n\nWhile anything involving Trump and January 6 is invariably politicized, Fritz Ulrich, one of the attorneys representing Fischer, hopes that will not be the case for the nine justices who will decide his client's fate-and that of hundreds more Trump supporters who attended the so-called \"Stop the Steal\" rally three-and-a-half years ago.\n\n\"In a statutory interpretation case like this, I'd like to think politics would play no role,\" said Ulrich. \"January 6 was a unique event in U.S. history, so it's not fair to compare it to other occurrences. It just doesn't seem to those of us who have been working on the 1512(c) issue that this provision reached the conduct prosecutors were alleging.\"\n\nAccording to court documents, Fischer, a police officer in Pennsylvania at the time, advanced about 25 feet into the Capitol and spent four minutes inside before exiting. Prosecutors note that he texted that members of Congress can't vote \"if they can't breathe\" and also that his police chief may need to post his bail because \"it might get violent.\"\n\nThe FBI arrested Fischer in February 2021, and in November 2021 a grand jury charged him with seven felonies and misdemeanors, including 1512. In March 2022, District Judge Carl Nichols dismissed the 1512 obstruction charge against Fischer, who was represented by Ulrich's wife, Lori, but government prosecutors appealed and in April 2023 a panel for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed Nichol's ruling with Fritz Ulrich representing Fischer.\n\nFischer immediately appealed the reversal and in December the U.S. Supreme Court said it would take up the issue, with Jeffrey Green joining Ulrich on behalf of Fischer.\n\n\"My wife won and I lost, so, hopefully, the Supreme Court will restore some domestic tranquility to our household,\" Fritz Ulrich quipped.\n\n\"What Congress came up with in the wake of Enron,\" he continued, \"was to include instances of document shredding and tampering with a witness. They were closing a loophole. The statute wasn't intended to have applications outside of those circumstances.\"\n\nDuring oral arguments on April 16, Justice Neil Gorsuch asked Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar about the potential breadth of the statute under the government's interpretation, wondering if the section could also apply to a heckler in the Supreme Court gallery, to a sit-in at a trial or to someone who pulled a fire alarm before a congressional vote, as Democrat Congressman Jamaal Bowman did last year.\n\nDuring oral arguments in the Supreme Court, Prelogar countered that Gorsuch's \"hypotheticals\" could be charged as obstruction if they were \"meaningful\" and had \"corrupt intent.\"\n\nBowman was not charged with 1512 at that time for his actions. The congressman made an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to one misdemeanor, pay a $1,000 fine and write an apology letter.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh noted that Fischer had been indicted on six other counts and asked Prelogar why that wasn't \"good enough,\" questioning if the 1512 charge was just a tool for increasing sentences for January 6 defendants. Prelogar said that one of Fischer's charges, assault, can carry a stiffer penalty than does 1512.\n\n\"I wouldn't say she scared us, or surprised us, but she's an exceptional oral advocate,\" Ulrich said of Prelogar.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Fischer was Green, who argued that the government \"wants to unleash\" the potential of a 20-year sentence on peaceful protesters in violation of the First Amendment. He called such a scenario \"a very serious tool to put in the hands of prosecutors,\" and said it was not the intention of 1512.\n\nAccording to SCOTUSblog.com, Justice Elena Kagan was particularly resistant to Green's argument, writing that she stressed there are \"multiple ways in which the drafters could have made clear that Section 1512(c)(2) only applies to evidence tampering - but they did not.\"\n\nUlrich also told Newsweek that his presumption is that rules associated with collateral review mean that the few who were sentenced for obstruction under 1512 more than a year ago won't benefit should Fischer win.\n\n\"It won't open the door for everyone who wants to get out of prison,\" he said. \"But a lot of cases were stayed and held pending Fischer, so those men and women would go back to court and be resentenced.\"\n\nPredictably, Fischer vs. United States has become a political football, with some conservatives warning that if the court sides with government prosecutors over Fischer it will set the stage for authorities to pick and choose which protesters should face prosecution and which should not, based on the political leanings of the demonstrators.\n\nOn February 5, Senator Tom Cotton and Congressman Jim Jordan filed a Supreme Court brief in support of Fischer that was signed by an additional 21 Republican members of the House and Senate.\n\n\"The Biden administration's pursuit of its political opponents must be stopped. Their strained interpretation of the law would criminalize vast swathes of everyday political conduct and violate the First Amendment,\" Cotton said when filing the brief.\n\n\"Congress never granted, and no administration should have the power to lock up political opponents for 20 years for merely trying to 'influence' Congress,\" Cotton said.\n\nConservatives have long suspected that the use of 1512 against Capitol rioters was more than coordinated, but nefarious, and on Tuesday the Wall Street Journal reported that Attorney General Merrick Garland and his team \"spent hours gaming out how a law designed to tackle white-collar fraud could apply to the attack.\"\n\nIn testimony Tuesday during a House Judicial Committee hearing on a variety of topics, Republican Congressman Thomas Massie asked Garland: \"Is your office preparing to drop charges against more than 340 January 6ers charged with 1512(c)(2) and release dozens from prison on that count if the Supreme Court this month reverses how your department has used that statute?\"\n\nGarland responded with, \"Whatever the court rules, we will act appropriately. I don't answer hypotheticals; we'll wait and see what the Supreme Court says.\"\n\nAmong those who support the use of 1512 on J6ers is CREW, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, run by Noah Bookbinder, a former member of the Homeland Security Advisory Counsel who was appointed by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas .\n\n\"Will the Supreme Court kneecap a key law used to prosecute insurrectionists?\" CREW asked on its website in March. \"The convictions of hundreds of January 6th defendants could be invalidated, causing a huge step backwards for accountability.\"\n\nWhile defenders of 1512 support the 20-year sentence maximum it affords, no January 6 defendant has yet to receive such a penalty. In August, The Hill reported that Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes received 18 years, the longest sentence thus far, but it's unknown what his penalty might have been without the 1512 charge given he was also convicted of seditious conspiracy, which also carries a 20-year sentence.\n\nAs the Supreme Court considers Fischer's fate, those charged with 1512 after the Capitol riot are holding out hope.\n\n\"They're praying, they're hoping, all of the above,\" said Joe Jenkins, whose girlfriend, Rachel Powell, is in a West Virginia prison where she has bonded with a half-dozen or so other January 6 defendants.\n\nIn a letter from prison, Powell complained about several aspects of her incarceration, especially noting that the Secure Female Facility Hazelton, where she'll serve nearly five years-though perhaps less if Fischer prevails-allows transgender inmates.\n\n\"The worst thing of all is women being forced to house with biological males,\" wrote Powell. \"One woman was recently put into SHU (solitary confinement) after experiencing abuse from a male. Another was shipped off the compound after having sex with several women, some of them filing complaints. One young female inmate was given $300 worth of Suboxone to sleep with a biological male.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons declined Newsweek's request for comment. Its guidelines stipulate that placement of transgender or intersex inmates are based on their \"health and safety, and whether a placement would present management or security problems.\"\n\nThat January 6 defendants are having a rough time while incarcerated isn't surprising to Ulrich.\n\n\"Doing time in the Bureau of Prisons is beyond difficult. Most of these 'J6ers' don't have any prior experience, so it's no surprise that suddenly spending time in the BOP is a shock,\" Ulrich told Newsweek .\n\nFor his part, Trump has already signaled he'd pardon some January 6 defendants, including those who violated 1512, should he win the presidency in November.\n\nBeyond additional prison time, those convicted of 1512 also risk their ability to travel to foreign countries, to possess firearms, and their right to vote, depending on which state they live in.\n\nAlready, roughly 10 January 6 defendants have been released or will be while the Supreme Court decides the Fischer case. In March, for example, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden said Kevin Seefried, who strolled through the Capitol while carrying a Confederate flag, should be released after serving one year for misdemeanors.\n\nBut the judge said that prosecutors can revisit the additional two years he was sentenced to for his lone felony conviction-that being 1512-once the Supreme Court rules on Fischer.\n\nThere are presumptions, meanwhile, that some judges will seek to enhance sentences if Fischer is successful by dictating sentences on lesser crimes be served consecutively rather than concurrently, an issue addressed by Judge McFadden when he ordered the release of Seefried.\n\n\"The government is left to rely on the speculative claim that, without the felony conviction, the Court would convert Seefried's concurrent sentences to consecutive ones,\" McFadden wrote.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's 1512(c)(2) ruling is what we're banking on now,\" said Jeff Zink, who is J6 defendant Ryan Zink's father and a Republican candidate for U.S. Congress in Arizona. \"We're getting the message out by educating people and the press.\"\n\nWhile both were at the Capitol on January 6, neither entered the building and only Ryan Zink was charged with crimes, largely due to his menacing posts online.\n\n\"We felt the election had been stolen and we wanted to peacefully protest. We didn't participate in any violence,\" said Jeff Zink.\n\nAttorney Roger Roots, who is defending Ryan Zink and other January 6 defendants, confirmed that some judges have stated they'll consider longer sentences for misdemeanors should 1512 be invalidated, but most have yet to address the prospect.\n\n\"The norm in all of federal sentencing is for multi-count sentences to run concurrently. It is highly unusual for courts to sentence people to consecutive sentences for multiple counts,\" said Roots.\n\nIn the case of Zink, he'd likely serve less than a year should 1512 be invalidated, potentially knocking a few decades off his sentence.\n\n\"There is probably a lot of case law disfavoring consecutive sentences as an abuse of discretion, unless there are unusual circumstances,\" said Roots. \"The government can ask for more time regarding other counts, but nothing makes judges agree.\"\n\nRoots also represents Stephanie Baez, who entered the Capitol wearing a shirt depicting an image of 1984 author George Orwell and told the FBI she assumed she was allowed in the building because \"everyone was calm\" and she checked the Capitol's official website to make sure it wasn't closed to the public.\n\nLike Zink, she posted menacing things online that day, including: \"Welp time to get back and storm the building\" and, \"Police let us through the barriers, they only really messed up breaking windows. But it's our capitol building, we pay for it.\"\n\nBaez was released on $10,000 bail nearly three years ago and faces trial in about a month on misdemeanors, as well as the 1512 charge that prosecutors included later.\n\n\"The DOJ vindictively added the charge when she wouldn't plead guilty to misdemeanors,\" said Roots.\n\nThe DOJ told Newsweek it had no comment for this report.\n\n\"The 1512 charge was also added vindictively, along with a bogus 'assault' charge, against John Todd when Todd refused to plead to misdemeanors,\" Roots said of another of his clients.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Todd hurled profanities at Metropolitan Police Department officers who instructed him to leave the Capitol Rotunda on January 6 and threatened to \"hip toss\" one of them. The former Marine also scuffled with an officer, resulting in his makeshift flagpole breaking and the officer needing stitches on a finger.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to say specifically how many years will be lopped off sentences should Fischer prevail, since sentences are so far all over the map. James Breheny, for example, was charged under 1512 but received only house arrest, probation and a $2,000 fine because he helped the FBI prosecute others.\n\nJacob Chansley, the so-called QAnon Shaman who wore a headdress with fur and horns inside the Capitol, might provide one of the cleanest examples, given he was convicted solely of obstruction under 1512 and served 41 months in prison.\n\nChansley pled guilty to 1512, which has been the norm when it is the only charge, suggesting that plea deals are happening behind the scenes. For those going to trial, 1512 is typically one of many charges, as was the case with Kelly Meggs, convicted of 1512 and a host of other felonies and misdemeanors and sentenced to 12 years.\n\n\"The 1512 charge has been the focal point for the DOJ in a lot of the J6 cases. If the court takes the charge away, the landscape of J6 litigation changes significantly,\" said Roots.\n\nAnd Brandon Fellows-who became a social-media sensation on Monday as he made silly faces while seated behind Dr. Anthony Fauci during House testimony about his handling of the COVID-19 crisis-was sentenced to 37 months for his 1512 conviction and four misdemeanors, while the judge tacked on an additional five months for contempt given a lack of remorse.\n\nFellows, who entered the Capitol through a broken window on January 6 and smoked marijuana in a senator's office, already served his prison sentence, though he remains on supervised release for the next 36 months.\n\nAfter the right praised his behavior at Fauci's hearing and the left criticized it, Fellows addressed Fischer v. United States in a post on X, indicating that it's not too late for him to benefit should Fischer prevail.\n\n\"Yes I'm a felon, but only until the Supreme Court dismissed (sic) the felony later this month. Look up the opening statements of USA V Fisher (sic)... My supervised release is about to end,\" he wrote .\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nPaul Bond has been a journalist for three decades.

It's unclear if he is still pursuing those dreams post-pardon.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek senior reporter based in New York City.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe federal government has issued a warning to defendants serving prison sentences for their alleged roles in the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol that their plea to the Supreme Court could backfire.\n\nMore than 1,200 individuals, including Donald Trump , have been charged for their alleged involvement in the riot , which saw a group of the former president's supporters violently protest the 2020 election results, which Trump has continually claimed, without providing any substantial evidence, was stolen. Many of these defendants have already been convicted of a crime and are serving prison sentences.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments on April 16 in one case that could upend hundreds of January 6 cases.\n\nThat case, Fischer v. United States , challenges the Department of Justice 's use of the \"obstruction of an official proceeding\" charge, which has been used against Jan. 6 defendants for allegedly disrupting the Electoral College certification. Some defendants are already arguing they should be released pending the final ruling in the case.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves wrote in a court filing that this could backfire and lead to some defendants serving more prison time. The filing was in relation to the case of Anthony Williams , a 50-year-old man from Brownstown, Michigan, who was sentenced to 9 months in prison for his alleged part in the riot.\n\nIn the filing, Graves wrote that even if the Supreme Court strike down their use of the charge, resulting in a reversal on Williams' conviction on that specific count, it may not necessarily result in a shorter prison sentence.\n\nGraves' reasoning is that \"because, in the absence of a 1512(c)(2) conviction, the government's sentencing recommendation would likely be different and could include a request for consecutive sentences on William's misdemeanor count,\" rather than allowing him to serve his time for all counts concurrently.\n\nThe government did not request consecutive sentences because sentencing guidelines related to Williams' 1512(c)(2) charge was \"adequate to satisfy the purposes of sentencing, including general and specific deterrence and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities,\" Graves wrote, adding this may change in the case of a reversal of that charge.\n\n\"The calculus on resentencing would necessarily change, and a reversal of the 1512(c) conviction could increase the aggregate sentence on the remaining counts,\" the filing reads.\n\nWhen reached by Newsweek, the attorney representing Williams said he plans file and will reserve comments for a reply later in the week.\n\nConservative attorney Julie Kelly responded to the filing on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter .\n\n\"Make no mistake-this is Graves' way of threatening J6ers sentenced for DOJ unlawful use of 1512c2: if you ask for release or reduced sentence based on SCOTUS' likely reversal of obstruction count, we'll figure out a way to make you serve MORE time,\" she wrote .\n\nShe added that it may be a message to the Supreme Court to \"go ahead and reverse the most common nonviolent felony count in J6 prosecution, who cares?\"\n\nAndrew Stanton is a Newsweek weekend reporter based in Maine.

      "text": "The Shame of It All\n\nThe coming rehabilitation of the January 6ers.\n\nHow many pardoned January 6 rioters will serve in the next Congress?\n\nI'd set the over/under at something like 3.5, with an outside chance that there'll be enough elected to form a small but vibrant House Insurrectionist Caucus. Come January 2027, it's quite likely that some Capitol Police officer stationed inside the building will feel a flash of recognition as a new congressman passes him in the hall: Isn't that the guy who bear-sprayed me and clubbed me with a flagpole?\n\nPer The Daily Beast , some are already thinking about a future in politics. Convicted seditionist Stewart Rhodes, leader of the Oath Keepers, was back on Capitol Hill Wednesday, one day after Donald Trump commuted his 18-year sentence. He told the Wall Street Journal that he hopes to work in Trump's administration, possibly at, uh, the FBI. Proud Boys chief Enrique Tarrio, reprieved from a 22-year sentence for his own seditionist activity, more modestly imagined himself door-knocking for candidates who represent \"the new conservative movement\" to which he belongs.\n\nIf you open your door in the fall of 2026 to find a goon squad of scowling brownshirts on your porch demanding that you accept a campaign flier for the local Republican or else, the smart move is to say \"thanks\" and accept. Don't bother calling the cops; if you live in a red state and someone ends up getting hurt, these chuds will just get pardoned again.\n\nThe more ambitious J6ers are destined to think bigger by running for office themselves, though, and why wouldn't they? Empowering violent seditionists is an American tradition. No fewer than 63 former Confederates were chosen to serve in the U.S. Senate following the Civil War. Alexander Stephens, vice president of the Confederacy, was named to the Senate by Georgia's state legislature the year after the war ended but was barred. Undaunted, he successfully ran for the U.S. House in 1873 and held his seat for nearly a decade.\n\nNationalists believe that making America great \"again\" requires making it more like it used to be, right? Well, it used to be that insurrectionists were rewarded with high office, and so it will be again. \"Greatness\" is a nuanced concept.\n\nSkeptics might remind me at this point that pardoning the J6ers is quite unpopular , as are the J6ers themselves. A CBS News poll published earlier this month found that, even among Republicans, just 30 percent approved of those who forced themselves into the Capitol that day; an equal share strongly disapproved and 40 percent somewhat disapproved. Which, admittedly, doesn't sound like the makings of a successful congressional candidacy.\n\nJust you wait, though.\n\nA key early subplot of Trump's second term is Democrats agonizing over how much to cooperate with the president and his party and how much to resist. \"We're obviously in a bit of disarray,\" one Democratic senator bluntly confessed to Semafor . \"I don't think people are really completely sure about what lesson is to be learned in this election.\" What goal should liberals set for the coming year?\n\nOn Wednesday Jonathan Last made it simple for them: Democrats should do everything they can to make Trump less popular. \"When a president is popular, nothing sticks and nothing matters,\" he wrote. \"When a president is unpopular, every stupid, random thing is a catastrophe they have to answer for.\" Trump's political capital won't begin to erode until the public stops extending him the benefit of the doubt, so job one for the left is do what it can to make that happen.\n\nEvents might do it for them. Already the price of eggs is on its way up , for instance, not because of Trump's policies but because bird flu has killed 30 million chickens in the past three months. Even so, fickle American voters aren't known for being sticklers about cause and effect. If those voters come to believe that candidate Trump sold them some magic beans about controlling the cost of living, disillusionment about him might spread the same way it did about Joe Biden after the collapse of Afghanistan. Biden never recovered. Trump might not either.\n\nEgg prices are out of Democrats' hands-but rubbing Trump's face in his filthy pardons and commutations for the J6ers is not, Last argued. The out party should showcase the worst of the worst among the insurrectionists in advertising campaigns and make household names of people like David Dempsey , who used \"his hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on\" to attack police officers, according to prosecutors. If Americans come to think of Dempsey when they think of Trump, the president will be badly damaged.\n\nIt's a nice theory. But I don't buy it and neither does Trump. How else to explain his surreal interest in inviting some of the freed J6ers to the White House ?\n\nNormally politicians are sensitive about photo ops. Think of the reports you see every midterm cycle about skittish congressmen who are up for reelection in competitive districts avoiding their party's unpopular president and asking him not to campaign in their backyards. The fastest way to lose popularity in politics is to be seen gladhanding someone who's already unpopular. Yet the J6ers are unpopular and Trump seems eager to gladhand them.\n\nWhy? If Last is right that the insurrectionists are a potential liability for him, the last thing he should want to do is saddle himself with that liability by embracing them.\n\nBut this is where Trump, the most successful con artist who's ever lived, understands human psychology better than eggheads like Last and I do.\n\nEmbracing the J6ers might hurt him a bit in the near term, but it'll pay off in the long run by reducing the social stigma around them. The way the president will keep them from becoming a political liability isn't by avoiding them, it's by doing the opposite-by normalizing them until people hear the name \"David Dempsey\" and don't blink.\n\nShamelessness is infectious. If there's anything profound about Trumpism, it's that.\n\nIt's been said before that shamelessness is Trump's superpower , but that's not quite right. His superpower is making a spectacle of his shamelessness to convince Americans who should know better that there isn't anything to be ashamed of. Students of demagoguery have always marveled at the cunning he displays by not trying to hide his corruption, something I saw firsthand recently in chatting with family about his new memecoin bribery scam . How can it be corrupt, one relative wondered, if he's doing it out in the open?\n\nTo a human being prone to normal emotions like shame and remorse, his sheer brazenness is powerful evidence that he sincerely believes he's done nothing wrong-which in turn is evidence that he really might not have done anything wrong. That's the essence of his messaging strategy around January 6, one of the most successful propaganda campaigns in U.S. history. Through herculean amounts of shamelessness and gaslighting, never apologizing or betraying any sense of regret, the president and his toadies in right-wing media successfully persuaded millions of swing voters that America's first-ever coup attempt was either no big deal or some sort of frame-up.\n\nIf, through sheer shamelessness, you can turn a putsch into what's functionally a 50-50 issue, you can do anything.\n\nSo why wouldn't he continue to follow that strategy with the J6ers? By welcoming them to the White House, he'd be signaling in the boldest way possible that he and they have nothing to be ashamed of. The stigma around them will erode, leading elements of the public that had looked dimly on the insurrection to feel more ambivalent about it. And Republican voters, always so susceptible to Trump's influence, might at last come to see them as the \"patriots\" he's forever claiming they are.\n\nBy the time some of them run for Congress in 2026, the 70 percent of the GOP that disapproves of pardoning them will have softened considerably. In blood-red House districts, their criminal convictions will be seen as badges of honor, afforded the sort of respect that the right once reserved for military service. I wouldn't entirely rule out David Dempsey returning to the Capitol, this time as his place of employment.\n\nIf you want to boil frogs , you have to turn up the heat. That's what Trump is doing by embracing the J6ers. It might already be working: The latest poll on his decision to grant clemency to insurrectionists has 43 percent in favor , easily the best numbers I've ever seen on that question. After the inevitable thumbs-up photo op with Rhodes and Tarrio in the Oval Office, I wouldn't be surprised if it settles in the high 40s.\n\nYou can see why Democrats are at sea right now about how to confront Trump.\n\nThey're at sea on policy, spooked by the fact that some of their working-class base defected to the GOP on Election Day. If they pitch a fit over his immigration crackdown, the centerpiece of his domestic agenda, they'll be seen as the same ol' open-borders radicals that Americans rejected in November.\n\nBut they're also at sea on how to respond to civic abominations like the J6 pardons. Granted, numerous congressional liberals criticized Trump for that this week, but the tone was muted. \"In one fell swoop, he gave cover and a permission structure for political violence in this country,\" Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock said of Trump-before pronouncing himself \"concerned.\" In the president's first term, Warnock and his colleagues would have been a lot more than \"concerned\" about him choosing to place political street fighters and paramilitary thugs above the law.\n\nI don't blame Democrats for not leaning into moral outrage this week, though. Why bother? It doesn't work. Americans don't share it, or don't share it enough. The campaign was a referendum on whether the shame of having a president with a coup plot, two impeachments, and four indictments to his record would bother swing voters enough to prefer a lackluster normie Democrat instead. We got our answer.\n\nNo wonder some of the shriller Trump critics in the media are either calling for détente with the White House or being quietly sidelined . Shrillness has gotten us nowhere. (Although it works okay if you earn a living by writing a daily political newsletter, ahem.) Voters want to give Trump a shot on policy and have been successfully conditioned not to feel ashamed of him, no matter how disgustingly he behaves. If you're a left-wing officeholder, why howl into the void about it?\n\nEven if Democrats had an effective message, it's an open question at this point whether they could overcome Trump's propaganda machine and reach Americans in meaningful numbers. An example: Joe Biden's margin of victory in the 2020 popular vote was three times larger than Trump's in 2024 but almost twice as many Americans believe Trump won more comfortably than Biden did . That's what two and a half months of relentless moronic \"MOST HISTORIC LANDSLIDE EVER\" screeching has done to public opinion.\n\nOur politics is increasingly postliberal on policy and already post-shame on leadership: What exactly can Democrats do except pray for the price of eggs to double?\n\nFrankly, I wonder if Jonathan Last is right to believe that driving down Trump's popularity would meaningfully constrain his power as president. He's term-limited ( hopefully! ) and clearly intends to govern much more autocratically this time around, having learned the ins and outs of wielding power over his first four years. If pardoning the J6ers really does hurt his approval rating, so what? Are the congressional Republicans who feared in 2021 that they'd be killed if they voted to impeach him going to courageously roadblock his agenda when he's polling at 43 percent approval instead of 48?\n\nThe point of the authoritarian project is to treat all constraints on executive power, including public opinion , as illegitimate and to desensitize the public to that fact. Pardoning the J6ers can be understood as another step in the process. If Americans don't like it, tough. They put him in charge; they'll learn to live with it.\n\nI'm convinced that Americans will end up holding Trump to a lower standard morally, ethically, and civically in his second term than they have other presidents, and not just because his infectious shamelessness has numbed them to his outrages.\n\nIt's because, unlike in his first term, they knew what they were signing up for. You cannot watch January 6 happen, vote for him four years later, and then huff indignantly when he starts his own crypto Ponzi scheme or cuts off security for a critic who's under credible threat of being murdered by terrorists . Even if you feel a pang of vestigial embarrassment or disgust about it, you can't complain without looking like a preposterous rube. Trump is being Trump. What on earth did you expect?\n\nSo many Americans won't complain, if only to save face. They'll rationalize. If he wants to pardon a bunch of insurrectionists and then make them FBI agents or whatever, Trump voters will swallow that bitter pill with a pained smile on their faces and strain for a way to celebrate the taste. \"They might turn out to be good agents because they really understand how the justice system works now.\"\n\nWe can (and should) scoff at Trump's claims that the election gave him a \"mandate\" on policy given the narrowness of his victory and questionable popular support for key parts of agenda . But a mandate to behave shamelessly? It's hard to argue that Americans didn't grant him that.\n\nWhen I read a list of 10 excuses Republicans in Congress have already made for his despicable J6 pardons , then, I'm of two minds about it. On the one hand, the moral depravity required to justify impunity for violent seditionists is so irresponsible in political leadership that it feels like a Rubicon-crossing, even by the loathsome standards of the GOP. After this, I can't imagine what Republican leaders could or would say to voters in party primaries to discourage them from electing insurrectionists to Congress.\n\nCome to think of it, I can't imagine what they could or would say to condemn the next act of organized violence to serve Trump. If leftists stage a sit-in to obstruct federal immigration officials from detaining some illegal immigrants, and a bunch of Proud Boys show up and stab some of them to death, what's the Republican take on that? The best we could expect, I think, is some mealy-mouthed both-sides-ism about how violence is bad but civil disobedience is also bad.\n\nSo, certainly, the cowardice they showed this week by not emphatically denouncing the pardons is reprehensible. But on the other hand: What on earth did you expect?\n\nOur problem is not Republicans in Congress or even the Republican in the White House. Our problem, as ever , is the millions of boiled frogs who've concluded that shamelessness is a political virtue, not a vice. Blame them for what's happened, and for what's to come.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

      "text": "Fascist Rhetoric or Fascist Actions?\n\nThe president-elect has talked like a fascist for years, but what might he do that meets that threshold?\n\nLast year President Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of leading an \"extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs in our democracy.\" Vice President Kamala Harris put a finer point on it last month. Donald Trump, she said , was a fascist.\n\nIt's commonplace, of course, for Democrats to call Republicans fascists; they've been doing so since at least the 1960s. The difference this time is that fellow Republicans and Trump's own former chief of staff agree. Trump unmistakably talks like a fascist, which is why people have been warning about imminent fascism for years. He admires dictators, praises violence, bullies the media, exudes machismo, demonizes opposition, preaches belligerent nationalism, and encourages total, personal loyalty to himself.\n\nTrump's rhetorical fascism has been clear for years, which is why, nine years ago , when Trump was running for president the first time, I ( along with many others ) accused him of being a fascist, based on his Muslim ban, admiration for autocrats, praise of violence, and calls to crack down on press freedom.\n\nBut does he do anything fascist? Does he match words with action? In 2018 I queried the claim again , this time by looking at the first 18 months of Trump's administration and comparing his words and deeds  to the Nazis in the 1930s. \"You have to be paranoid and devoid of all historical perspective to believe that Trump's America is full-blown fascist right now in 2018,\" I concluded. \"But you also have to be singularly insensitive and devoid of all historical perspective to be untroubled about the trend lines in American political culture.\"\n\nThe trend lines that worried me: \"We do have an unseemly personality cult, a clear shift in the culture of discourse about race, and a blurring of the lines between religion and nationalism. These trends are truly troubling.\"\n\nNow we have a full Trump term and a second and third presidential campaign behind us. Trump has been much clearer about what he wants to do and he has more experience in getting it done. As Trump has rolled out his Cabinet nominees and other high-level appointees, his full legacy is coming into focus. What's the fascism scorecard as we approach 2025?\n\nThere are a few things we can expect from Trump that are neither fascist nor authoritarian, despite what the left will inevitably say about them: conservative judges, pro-life legislation, and bellicose rhetoric on the world stage. Trump is likely to pursue some or all of these things and none of them are remotely anti-democratic, authoritarian, or fascist. They might be wise or foolish, and the left will hate them all, but calling them fascist will only cheapen the word and desensitize the public to its use.\n\nBut not everything Trump has said or will do can be dismissed as old-fashioned conservatism expressed via mean tweets. And for those matters, what might be most helpful is to draw a distinction between generic authoritarianism and bespoke American fascism, complete with a fetish for violence, hierarchy, purity, and leader-worship. Some things are run-of-the-mill authoritarian (still bad, but not goose-stepping fascist), while others are clear, dispositive signs that a distinctive American-style fascism has arrived.\n\nThere are some things Trump has talked about doing that might be authoritarian, or might not, depending on circumstance and intent, including: reinstating Schedule F, regulating social media companies, pursuing an agenda of economic populism, border enforcement and deportations, and invoking the Insurrection Act.\n\nSchedule F , which Trump originally introduced in 2020 before Biden revoked it, converts civil service positions into politically appointed positions, giving the president more power over the executive branch. More executive branch cohesion isn't necessarily authoritarian. I tend to think the presidency needs more control over the executive branch-coupled with far more checks and balances from the other two branches. The problem is what Trump might do with a more responsive executive branch, especially when unchecked from a subservient and supine Republican Congress.\n\nRegulating social media and pursuing economic populism are similarly in \"it depends\" territory. If \"regulation\" is just another word for pressuring social media companies to favor Trump's speech and disfavor progressive speech, that's definitely authoritarian. If economic populism becomes a vehicle of corruption and patronage for Trump and his cronies to get rich off the public purse, that's classic authoritarianism. Enforcing a border isn't authoritarian-it is, actually, what the law mandates-nor are deportations. But doing so with heedless disregard for migrants' humanity (such as through the family separation policy) would be.\n\nMost worryingly, Trump has suggested invoking the Insurrection Act to crack down on crime. The law was used in the past to put down riots and enforce integration; it has a legitimate use. But Trump has hinted that he will use the law against street crime, likely to embarrass Democratic mayors and governors. Again, the devil is in the details: Authoritarianism would not be in the act itself, but in its intent, timing, target, and effects.\n\nThen there are things that would definitely be authoritarian-though not necessarily specifically fascist.\n\nPoliticizing and weaponizing the bureaucracy for partisan gain is classic authoritarianism. (One of the charges against President Richard Nixon was the abuse of power by misusing federal agencies for political gain.) Trump has repeatedly promised to embark on a campaign of retribution against his political enemies, suggesting he may use the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute them . His nomination of Pam Bondi as attorney general and Kash Patel as FBI director seem a clear sign he intends to make his threats a reality. Bondi helped defend Trump in his first impeachment trial and spread election denialism in 2020. Patel, in addition to promoting election denialism, has called for retribution against those who helped Biden \"rig\" the election. He even wrote a series of children's books about Trump's heroic battle against his enemies.\n\nTrump may try to purge the bureaucracy and military leadership to ensure only those personally loyal to him are in positions of power. It's normal for presidents to hire and fire their inner circle based on loyalty, but Trump seems to want to expand that to the entire federal workforce and the military. Trump's nomination of Pete Hegseth to be secretary of defense, again, seems to indicate his intent to clean house at the Pentagon-though Sen. Marco Rubio seems less likely to follow suit at the State Department.\n\nTrump may use the Insurrection Act-or normal police tactics-against peaceful protesters, not simply against rioters. The incident at Lafayette Square in June 2020 is a possible precedent (though it seems interagency bickering and bureaucratic incompetence played a role in that). Trump repeatedly suggested in the past that he wanted to revise laws about libel and defamation to make it easier to sue the media. Constraining free speech is, again, classic authoritarianism.\n\nTrump has suggested, hinted, or joked about doing all these things. His supporters tell us to take him seriously, not literally, and Trump regularly deflects criticism by insisting that he is joking. Watching to see if Trump turns these jokes into policy will be a key indicator telling us how seriously to take him.\n\nOne challenge in describing things as specifically fascist is that, famously, there isn't a consensus definition of fascism. The ways in which Trumps seems most clearly to approach fascism have more to do with style, rhetoric, and attitude than with governance.\n\nTrump referred to his political opponents as \" vermin ,\" accused immigrants of \" poisoning the blood of our country ,\" and warned about the danger from the \" enemy from within .\" He regularly speaks in a way that is-to put it charitably-racially insensitive. He scapegoats an out-group (immigrants) to blame them for crime, violence, and economic woes. He plays on a strong us-versus-them hostility to keep the base energized. The level of personal devotion and personal loyalty he demands and receives is, to outside observers, creepy and weird.\n\nCalling Trump's rhetoric and posturing \"fascist\" isn't a particularly hard call. Read a few speeches from Mussolini and you'll hear the obvious parallels, which is why intellectuals who read history are the most alarmed about Trump. There isn't (or shouldn't be) much serious debate on this point: Trump's rhetoric and symbolic behavior are demonstrably fascist.\n\nPut it together and you see a movement that is performative fascism . Followers get the frisson and thrill of talking and posturing like fascists without the guilt of acting like them. Cocksure; punchy; spoiling for a fight; driven by nostalgia, fear, and anger; obsessed with internal enemies; preaching law and order; lustful for violence; defined by a single charismatic leader. ... It is fascism as vibes, the fascism of mood and attitude, fascism as a lifestyle brand. It is fascist-chic . ( Fascchic ?)\n\nThe question remains: Will he do anything actually fascist?\n\nWe're unlikely to see Congress create legal privileges for the dominant ethnic or religious group (conservative white Christians) and restrict the citizenship rights of everyone else. We're unlikely to see Trump suspend the Constitution (even though he joked about doing so) to create a one-party state under his singular, personal rule. We're unlikely to see Trump and the Congress legally proscribe opposition parties.\n\nI think we're even unlikely to see a surge of militarism (by which I don't mean hawkish foreign policy, but a culture of regimentation, hierarchy, and obedience as a style for civilian life). Trump is too chaotic and incompetent to go for full-on militarism, and American political culture has too much latent libertarianism within it to tolerate it.\n\nI do not say that to downplay or minimize Trump's fascism. I think Trump will actually try to do one of the most clearly fascist things he's suggested: Trump said he will pardon January 6 rioters. That, I believe, would be the signature move of a Trump administration intent on turning fascist vibes into fascist governance. Why would this be such a big deal?\n\nPardoning the J6ers would politicize the justice system, reward Trump's most loyal followers for breaking the law, and signal that physical violence is acceptable when done in Trump's cause. It would directly incentivize more violence and more law-breaking, and would signal to police and courts across the country that Trump's supporters enjoy presumptive immunity for anything they may do in the course of advocating for Trump.\n\nWithout exaggeration, it would turn the most zealous MAGA supporters into Trump's brownshirts.\n\nIt would validate the narrative that Trump and his followers have been the victims of a witch hunt and that they must get revenge to get justice. Pardoning the J6ers would supercharge all the most clearly fascist aspects of the MAGA movement. It would, in effect, make supporting Trump the new standard of lawfulness.\n\nThe president has access to a wide range of powers, many of which could be abused for illegitimate purposes. We tend to give most presidents the benefit of the doubt, trusting that Congress and the courts will step in if and when necessary.\n\nTrump does not deserve the benefit of doubt. He deserves minute scrutiny. But Congress will not step in to check him, and the courts are doubtful given the recent ruling on presidential immunity. That means when Trump uses his legitimate powers in questionable ways, he is likely to get away with it. And the more he gets away with it, the more he will be encouraged to keep going.\n\nThat is what makes it so important to put his every act under the microscope, to examine its intent and its effects, to watch for the broader pattern, to see whether Trump's administration is characterized more by conservative governance, by bumbling incompetence, or by fascist leanings. His pardoning of the J6ers will be one of the earliest indications.\n\nPaul D.

So far, Team Trump has said they would be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPublished: December 2, 2024 11:01pm\n\nPresident Joe Biden's pardon of his son Hunter appears to have given President-elect Donald Trump a pretext to follow through on his own pledges to pardon myriad Jan. 6 defendants and to pursue a rigorous overhaul of the Department of Justice.\n\nDespite repeated denials from the White House that he would do so, Biden announced his son's pardon on Sunday evening, saying he had been unfairly prosecuted and that he believed the DOJ had singled out his son.\n\n\"From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" he said .\n\nThe development stunned Democrats, many of whom had adamantly insisted that Biden would not pardon his son and that \"no one is above the law\" when defending the DOJ prosecutions of Trump. Republicans, however, were not so shocked and some have already suggested that the outgoing commander-in-chief set a precedent for his successor.\n\n\"No one in the media better complain when J6ers get their pardons now,\" said Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk .\n\nTrump himself linked the DOJ's handling of Jan. 6 defendants to the Hunter Biden case, asking \"[d]oes the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"\n\nHis comments followed headlines opining on Trump's relative silence on the prospect of Jan. 6 pardons. Politico , on Saturday, ran a headline that read \"Trump promised Jan. 6 pardons. His post-election silence is making loyalists nervous.\"\n\nTo be sure, Trump has already indicated he would pardon at least some defendants and the Hunter Biden pardon is more likely to serve as a political cover rather than an impetus for a previously unplanned effort.\n\nTrump press secretary-designate Karoline Leavitt previously said in a statement that \"[p]resident Trump will make pardon decisions on a case-by-case basis,\" leaving the prospective scope of executive pardons vague. More than 1,500 people have faced charges in connection with the disturbance at the Capitol.\n\nPotentially giving Trump an easy avenue to address a large number of pardons is a recent Supreme Court decision limiting the application of a charge that the DOJ used extensively in its prosecutions over the incident.\n\nThe nation's top court in June issued a landmark ruling on the DOJ's use of obstruction charges to pursue Jan. 6 defendants. Trump himself faced the charge of \"obstruction of an official proceeding\" in special counsel Jack Smith's now-defunct election case.\n\nThe justices found that the DOJ could apply the charge to those defendants whom they could prove had actually attempted to stop the transmission of electoral college vote certificates and interfere with the process.\n\nThe decision greatly reduced the number of participants in the incident that were eligible to face the charge and, in September, Thomas Robertson became the first defendant to receive a reduced sentence in light of the ruling.\n\nA federal judge in November granted a reduced sentence to Marc Bru , a member of the Proud Boys, dropping one year from his prison time stemming from the obstruction charge. He received a five-year sentence in that instance stemming from other charges.\n\nTrump's prior pledges to pardon defendants have triggered a wave of requests to delay or otherwise halt proceedings in myriad Jan. 6 cases. Such efforts have met with mixed reactions from the courts, however.\n\nJan. 6 defendant Jake Lang successfully secured a delay in his case last month, arguing that there was a \"high likelihood of a Presidential Pardon or dismissal of the charges by the incoming administration,\" according to The New York Post . Lang has spent more time in custody while awaiting trial than any other Jan. 6 defendant.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, the Trump-appointed judge who granted the delay, opined that \"[b]lanket pardons for all Jan. 6 defendants or anything close would be beyond frustrating and disappointing, but that's not my call,\" MSNBC reported. Other defendants have made similar pitches to that of Lang, pointing to Trump's campaign statements and prior exercise of his pardon powers during his term.\n\n\"History has shown that President Donald Trump is not shy when it comes to exercising his pardon powers and there is clearly no reason to believe he won't do as he says,\" attorneys for defendant Terry Allen argued in a motion .\n\nSome judges have been less willing to accommodate the delay requests, however. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell, in early November, rejected a bid from defendants Christopher Carnell and David Bowman to delay their cases in light of \"multiple clemency promises,\" HuffPost reported at the time.\n\nTrump's prior pardon statements have generally focused on non-violent offenders, but there were plenty of participants who faced charges for violent conduct. The Trump team's consideration of pardons on an individual basis seems to make it less likely that such persons could receive them. Some of the event's most prominent participants, however, could be eligible, though he has not committed to pardoning specific individuals.\n\nAdam Johnson aka the \"Podium Guy\", for instance, pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building. Johnson went viral for a photograph in which he smiled while carrying then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's podium. He received a 75-day sentence and a $5,000 fine in 2022.\n\nJacob Chansley aka the \"QAnon Shaman\" was easily the disturbance's most iconic figure, charging through the Capitol building shirtless while wearing a horned helmet. Chansley pleaded guilty to obstruction of an official proceeding and received a 41-month sentence in November 2021. He secured release in March of 2023."

      "text": "Miranda Devine: Trump used his finite political capital to pardon the Jan. 6 riot defendants - and right the egregious wrongs of Biden's DOJ\n\nIt took chutzpah for Donald Trump to pardon the Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendants and use up a big chunk of his finite political capital to do the right thing, against the advice of polite Washington.\n\nThat so many people still don't understand that it was the right thing to do is a product of a sophisticated and Machiavellian four-year propaganda campaign led by the Democratic Party's biggest liars, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin, and their tame GOP patsy Liz Cheney.\n\nAs much as the pardons right the wrongs against individual defendants, they also are a repudiation of the J6 prosecutions and the entire weaponized legal apparatus under Joe Biden.\n\nBefore delving into the injustice and Stasi-like harassment of 1,500 J6 defendants that drove at least five to suicide, it's worth looking at the absurdity of the wider case.\n\nOf all the crimes and threats to the United States - terrorism, organized crime, drug trafficking, espionage, drone attacks - why was a four-hour riot in Washington, DC, singled out by the DOJ and FBI to be the biggest investigation in their history? Bigger than 9/11, bigger than Enron.\n\nThe J6 riots did $1.5 million damage to the Capitol compared to $2 billion in damage caused by the BLM-Antifa George Floyd riots in the summer of 2020. Not to mention 25 deaths and countless injured cops.\n\nWith thousands of FBI and DOJ personnel mobilized to hunt down every Trump supporter who set foot on Capitol grounds, the cost of the J6 prosecutions has been immense, even with the free labor of malicious self-styled citizen \"sedition hunters.\"\n\nAn extra $780 million was allocated to the FBI and the DC US Attorney's Office just in 2022 for J6 cases, which they were working on right up until Trump's inauguration. The full cost over four years has yet to be calculated, but the opportunity cost was equally high. For example, FBI whistleblower Steve Friend says he was taken off child sexual abuse cases to investigate J6.\n\nHow many children have been abused, terrorist plots hatched, assassinations planned, or criminal gangs flourished while the FBI was looking the other way at some phantom threat of \"domestic conservative terrorism,\" whether J6ers, parents at school board meetings, pro-lifers, or Catholics at Latin Mass.\n\nThe J6 preoccupation was extreme overreach for a riot in which the only person killed was an unarmed female protester, Ashli Babbitt , shot by a trigger-happy Capitol Police officer with a troubling disciplinary record.\n\nFor all the effort Biden and the media put in to depict the riot as an \"insurrection,\" nobody was charged with that specific crime despite egregious overcharging by federal prosecutors. The Dems' rhetorical fiction was too much of a stretch even for them.\n\nBiden lied nonstop about the day, insisting that Officer Brian Sicknick \"was killed defending the Capitol,\" even though an autopsy found Sicknick had died the next day of a stroke and had no injuries on his body.\n\nOf course, the reason for the legal overreach was political, the fruit of a president who broke every norm to weaponize the justice system against his political enemies and manipulate it to protect his own corruption.\n\nFrom the minute he took office, Biden made J6 the centerpiece of his presidency. He used it vengefully to set up a division between MAGA \"deplorables\" and the rest of the country.\n\nDressed up as protecting \"democracy,\" J6 became a key plank of the Democrats' narrative and Biden's ill-fated re-election bid. It provided the pretext and justification for the lawfare against Trump.\n\nSign up for Devine Online, the newsletter from Miranda Devine\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nWant even more news?\n\nThe strategy failed, much to the befuddlement of Democrats who still are reeling from their crushing defeat at the hands of the man they thought they had killed off, figuratively and almost literally.\n\nIn that sense, it was poetic justice that one of Trump's first acts on reclaiming the presidency, on the very day of his inauguration, was to pardon all J6 defendants, apart from 14 whose sentences he commuted.\n\nDemocrats have been hyperventilating all week.\n\nInconveniently for them, Biden pulled the moral high ground out from under them with self-serving pardons for his family for any crimes committed over a suspiciously precise 11-year period and preemptive pardons for Cheney, the J6 committee and various other malefactors.\n\nNot to mention clemency he granted to various child molesters and cop-killers on his way out the door.\n\nSo Trump had cover for his J6 mass pardon.\n\n\"They've been treated very unfairly,\" he said as he signed the executive orders. \"The judges have been absolutely brutal. The prosecutors have been brutal. [The J6ers] have been in jail for a long time already.\"\n\nHe's right.\n\nThe \"raindrop theory\" of collective guilt was used by overzealous prosecutors and judges to impose extreme sentences on defendants charged with nonviolent crimes and hold them in detention without trial for two years or more, as independent reporter Julie Kelly so meticulously reported.\n\nMost of the charges were for misdemeanors like trespassing or disorderly conduct. Yet anyone who so much as wandered into the Capitol through an open door or trespassed on the lawn was subjected to a full-scale federal investigation.\n\nSome, like New Yorker Joseph Bolanos, 69, had just attended the Trump rally and was back at his hotel when the riot broke out, yet he was subjected to an FBI dawn raid and arrested in front of his neighbors.\n\nEnrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader , was sentenced to 22 years for seditious conspiracy but was not even in DC that day.\n\nHe spent almost three years in jail before being pardoned.\n\nJacob Chansley, the QAnon shaman , spent 27 months in jail for walking into the Senate chamber.\n\nYes, some thugs committed violence against police, and that is reprehensible, but they have already spent three or four years in jail, much of it in pre-trial detention.\n\nAmong the worst was Ryan Samsel, who assaulted police with a bike rack and threw a pole and a 2-by-4 at police lines. Prosecutors recommended a 20-year prison term. He served three years and 11 months before being pardoned.\n\nOnly one person, Guy Reffitt, was caught with a gun, which remained in its holster.\n\nHe was sentenced to seven years and had served four when he was pardoned.\n\nEven if you think they got off lightly, there has to be equal justice, and the lenient treatment of the Antifa-BLM rioters of 2020 suggests J6ers were unfairly treated.\n\nAmong the few convictions, the longest prison sentence was 10 years for Montez Terriel Lee Jr. , who set fire to a Minneapolis pawn shop and caused the death of a man trapped inside.\n\nJohn Earle Sullivan was sentenced to six months in jail for assaulting police during a different riot in Washington, DC.\n\nThe riot at Lafayette Park in front of the White House in June 2020 was as much an assault on democracy as the J6 riot since it was so violent that Trump had to be moved to an underground bunker.\n\nThe White House is as much a symbol of American democracy as the Capitol.\n\nAbout 150 law enforcement officers were injured, and the historic St. John's Church was set alight.\n\nBut only a few Lafayette Park rioters wound up in federal court and their sentences were nothing compared to J6. Taylor Taranto got 60 days in prison for assault on a federal officer. Ruben Camacho got 364 days.\n\nThe conclusion is that the system is rigged against Trump supporters.\n\nFor Trump, it's personal because he suffered from the same lawfare by the same people, with the same lies.\n\nBut in the end, the election turned the injustice on its head."

      "text": "Trump pardoned my cousin for assaulting a police officer Jan. 6 - it was the right call\n\n\"We didn't eat like this,\" my cousin Patrick jokes, cutting his steak at a homecoming dinner with family to celebrate his release from prison.\n\nPresident Trump pardoned Patrick on Day One of his White House return. My cousin had been serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence at the Elkton federal correctional institution in Ohio for his actions Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nPatrick is one of the \"violent\" J6ers Democrats and even some right-wing commentators and congressional Republicans say Trump shouldn't have pardoned. But like many of these cases, Patrick's has - to use the words of Vice President J.D. Vance - \"gray areas.\"\n\nPatrick McCaughey III was 23 years old when he drove to Washington, DC, with his father to protest what he saw as election manipulation. \"I went down there expecting we would probably listen to a couple speeches and protest visibly, stand in location and make our voices heard,\" he tells me. \"It was my first real political event, protest, rally.\"\n\nPatrick readily admits he didn't act well that day. He used a riot shield to push against a line of officers blocking the West Terrace entrance, pinning one to a doorway.\n\nYet if Democrats and the Biden Justice Department had treated J6ers - violent or not - the same way they treated Black Lives Matter protesters, pro-Palestinian protesters or regular criminal offenders, we would not be discussing pardons today.\n\n\"There were double standards in how sentences were applied to the J6 protesters versus other groups,\" Vance said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"A double standard that was not applied to many people, including of course the Black Lives Matter rioters who killed over two dozen people and never had the weight of a weaponized Department of Justice come against them.\"\n\nCritics will say this is whataboutism, but for a party so focused on criminal-justice reform and \"restorative justice,\" the Democrats were quick to indict J6ers as \"insurrectionists\" and equate them with \" domestic terrorists .\" Many J6ers were overcharged, denied bail and a speedy trial and sentenced to excessive prison terms.\n\nThe federal prosecutors in my cousin's case sought a more-than-15-year prison sentence. He had no criminal record. He'd never even gotten a speeding ticket. He owned no firearms. Yet when FBI agents banged on the door to arrest him at his father's home Jan. 19, 2021, they did so with guns drawn.\n\nA hulky guy with glasses and an avid reader, Patrick was a high-school honors student and speaks three languages. His politics skewed right in his teens, but COVID hardened his libertarian views. He was living with his mother in Fairfield County, Conn., at the time and working in residential construction with his father. He says watching fundamental rights \"being trampled upon with basic impunity\" made him speak up for the first time.\n\nHe got thrown off Twitter twice for posting that masks aren't effective. He wanted to make his voice heard.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Patrick and his father watched Trump's speech at the Ellipse, then marched to the Capitol. Patrick separated from his father, took a selfie on the scaffolding set up for President Joe Biden's inauguration and joined a crowd at the West Terrace entrance.\n\nSurveillance and bodycam video of the mêlée at that entrance is extensive. Patrick uses a clear-plastic police riot shield to push against the line of officers blocking the doorway. \"Just go home, man,\" Patrick yells.\n\n\"Pick the right side,\" a police officer shouts.\n\nA person behind Patrick squirts what looks like bear spray at the police. A man to Patrick's left reaches under the helmet of one of the officers, Daniel Hodges, and grabs his face. Hodges later said the man \"tried to gouge out my eye.\"\n\nThe crowd yells \"Heave-ho\" and pushes in unison to break the line of officers blocking the entrance. Hodges screams, wedged between a door frame and the shield Patrick holds.\n\n\"Let me back,\" Patrick yells. He pulls Hodges' face shield back down to, he tells me, protect him from the bear spray and tear gas. \"He's hurt,\" Patrick shouts, pointing to Hodges.\n\n\"I really was screaming at the top of my lungs to have them go back so that we might be able to extricate Officer Hodges from the situation,\" Patrick tells me.\n\nAt trial, Hodges conceded Patrick alerted another officer that Hodges was injured, and he was whisked to safety. Yet Hodges also says he was \"crushed\" by the force of Patrick's shield the whole time.\n\nPatrick never made it into the building. After Trump released a video later that day telling protesters to go home, he drove with his father back to his dad's house in South Salem, New York.\n\nAt his sentencing, US District Judge Trevor McFadden called Patrick a \"poster child of all that was dangerous and appalling\" about Jan. 6. Patrick apologized to the court, saying, \"My actions on January 6, 2021, will remain the greatest embarrassment of my life.\"\n\nHe's more nuanced with me. \"I don't regret going. I don't regret my thoughts at the time,\" he says. \"But I think that, ultimately, I went down there to effect positive change, and through rashness or anger, I managed to defeat my own purpose.\"\n\nI watched Jan. 6 on TV in shock and disgust. I couldn't understand how these people - protesting in the name of MAGA - thought battling police or calling for the hanging of Vice President Mike Pence helped their cause. I thought this would be a dark footnote to the Trump presidency and Trump's reputation would never recover.\n\nI was wrong. The Democrats all but ensured Trump's survival.\n\nFor all the Democrats' and the media's talk about \"insurrection,\" nobody was charged with that crime. Biden lied repeatedly that J6 protesters killed Officer Brian Sicknick, even though he died of two strokes caused by an artery clot the next day. Vice President Kamala Harris likened Jan. 6 to Sept. 11. The Democrats' entire platform became about \"saving democracy,\" and they used this as a pretext to prosecute Trump.\n\nWhen Patrick was arrested, he thought his father would be able to bail him out after the arraignment. \"I did not understand that there was going to be a judge from New York - a no-cash-bail state - who would say that I'm a monster and that I was too dangerous to be allowed out in the community,\" he says. \"That really was a wakeup call.\"\n\nPatrick was flown to Oklahoma and spent time in several different jails before ending up in the DC jail. Patrick calls that a bright spot in his incarceration because the entire ward was filled with J6ers. Due to the risk of COVID, they were only allowed out of their cells for one hour a day, but he says they helped each other contact their families, find lawyers and created a \"community much greater than any group of incarcerated people could expect.\"\n\nThey sang the national anthem every day, signed each other's pocket Constitutions and played charades once a week. In May, Patrick got out on bond with supervised release until trial.\n\nPatrick's father says \"nobody wanted to take the case,\" and he was advised that his son accept a plea deal. They refused.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged Patrick with several counts of assaulting an officer, including with a dangerous weapon, disorderly conduct and a slew of other offenses. His case was joined with that of five other J6 defendants he'd never met. He was forced into a trial group with two of them over his attorney's objections.\n\n\"I feel as if it was prejudicial to my case to be joined with these people,\" Patrick tells me. \"The government also dragged its heels for quite some time on allowing discovery.\"\n\nPatrick opted for a bench trial because, he says, \"the jury pool was so against us, against January 6 defendants, that it would have been impossible to get a fair trial there.\"\n\n\"Being a man of principle, no, I don't regret going,\" Patrick's father says about the Jan. 6 protest. But he calls the trial a \"kangaroo court\" and concedes, \"I was fairly naïve moving into the whole thing - that's where I really find fault with myself.\"\n\nThat the officer Patrick pinned with the shield was Daniel Hodges also didn't help his case. Hodges has become one of the most outspoken Jan. 6 police officers. He campaigned for Biden and then Harris, traveling to Michigan with her team. After Trump pardoned the J6ers, Hodges spoke at a press conference with Rep. Eric Swalwell, calling on members of Congress to oppose Trump's \"horrific agenda\" and warning the J6ers are now free to \"try it again.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of pressure placed upon the prosecutors and judge in my case to seek a conviction and to obtain one because there was so much media attention,\" Patrick says, \"combined with an officer who was only too happy to appear before Congress and to speak to the media.\"\n\nHodges did not return my request for comment.\n\n\"The Justice Department was energized in a way to explicitly convict. It was not a fact-finding mission. It was a retributive, vindictive mission,\" Patrick says.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2022, Patrick was convicted of seven felony counts, including assaulting an officer with a dangerous weapon, and remanded to prison. In April 2023, he was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years. He spent the bulk of his incarceration at the Elkton federal prison in Ohio, housed mainly with child molesters.\n\nAs a teenager and in my early 20s, I took part in a lot of radical-left protests. I missed the riot at the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in 1999, but I got teargassed at a 2000 Washington, DC, International Monetary Fund demonstration. I know something about the madness of crowds. I asked Patrick about this at dinner.\n\n\"It is something very fundamental to human beings that if you get enough people in a certain spirit in one area, that they're likely to behave less like rational individuals and more like a mob,\" he says. \"If you get into a shoving match with the cops, it's not the best. I know that.\"\n\nPatrick says most of the people he's met who traveled to Washington for the Jan. 6 protests had \"good intentions,\" though he concedes in a crowd that size there was likely a small percent who didn't. Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, whose sentence Trump commuted, had a cache of weapons stashed in a Virginia hotel room that day. Eric Munchel wore tactical gear and carried stolen zip ties in the Capitol. The guy wearing the \"Camp Auschwitz\" sweatshirt is probably not a mensch.\n\nThe overzealous prosecution of J6ers, though, has made these people martyrs to some on the right.\n\nPatrick is responsible for his actions Jan. 6, 2021. I don't condone violence. I'm not downplaying the significance of attacking the Capitol. But seven-and-a-half years is too much for the crimes he committed.\n\nA pro-Palestinian activist, Ruben Camacho, was sentenced to just 48 hours of community service for punching a female police officer at a protest outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in 2023. Edward Schinzing was sentenced to 15 months for breaking into and setting fire to a federal courthouse in Portland in 2020, with employees and prisoners still inside. A Black Lives Matter rioter who torched a Minneapolis pawn shop, causing the death of a person inside, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. That's five years less than prosecutors wanted for my cousin.\n\nPatrick is now 27 years old. He's softspoken with a dry sense of humor. Despite the pardon, his J6 conviction will follow him for the rest of his life - whenever he applies for a job or apartment or goes on a date. He was already debanked. But he is not a threat to society, and more prison time would likely only harden him, not make him a better candidate for release. Isn't that a pillar of the Democrats' criminal-justice reform?\n\nAt our dinner, Patrick didn't want to dwell on the bad experiences in prison. He spoke about how J6ers looked out for each other, helped new inmates navigate the prison phone system and organized rides and a hotel room when they were released at 1 a.m. Jan. 21.\n\nHe joked about getting caught once using a cellphone and the sense of humor the guard who assigned him to a 45-day stint in the special housing unit - a modern form of solitary confinement with one cellmate - must have had for pairing him with Frank Monte, New Jersey's number-one Trump stalker. \"I stayed away from cell phones after that,\" he says.\n\nPatrick plans to hike the Appalachian Trail this summer. Before Jan. 6, he'd been planning a trip to Japan. He taught himself Japanese. But he says he called the Japanese consulate last month, and it told him he can't visit the country with a criminal conviction, despite the pardon.\n\nIn the longer term, Patrick plans to move to New Hampshire or Montana to be around more \"liberty-minded people.\" He wants to build his own house and start a family.\n\n\"I'm not anybody special. I have a regular job. I love this country, but that's about it. In the great-man theory of history, I'm not one of them,\" Patrick says. \"I'm just overjoyed I'm free, that I'm able to interact with my family, to be with my loved ones, to enjoy my full rights.\"\n\nCaroline McCaughey covers politics and policy for The New York Sun.\n\nAdvertisement"

I granted that some of these folks were overcharged, and I asked him for two things: Examples of the most overcharged individuals, in his opinion, and a broader defense of the blanket pardon, as opposed to individual clemencies for specific folks who were grossly mistreated.\n\nOn the second question, Braynard gave me a long reply, which came after my deadline. I reprinted the relevant parts of his explanation below.\n\n\"I would make four cases for why the broad pardons are justified: First, according to the Federalist Papers , the pardon power exists to allow a President to heal national divisions caused by times of great strife. The first recipients of broad pardons were the violent participants in the Whiskey Rebellion, who tarred and feathered tax collectors (not a pleasant experience) and opened fire on an inspector's home. Another example is the participants in the Civil War, where Confederates killed 360,000 U.S. soldiers.\"\n\n\"The violence of these two events far exceeds what took place on January 6th, where no weapons were fired by protesters, and nobody other than protesters was killed.\"\n\n\"The January 6th First Amendment exercise was the basis for the phony 'insurrection' narrative, which served as the casus belli for the FBI to target protesting parents at school board meetings, kick patriotic Americans out of the military, debunk people like myself, and greatly enhance the sentences of the vast majority of J6ers who were not even charged with violence-all done with the ulterior motive of destroying President Trump and his supporters' chances of success in the upcoming election.\"\n\n\"This was a grave crime that merits the extraordinary response of broad pardons-to heal the damage caused by the Biden Administration's abuse of the justice system for tyrannical, political ends.\"\n\n\"The second reason I would give is that it was fundamentally impossible for J6ers to get a fair trial in D.C. My own criminal defense attorney, whom I had to retain because I was targeted by Jack Smith for telling the truth about the election, told me that his firm and many others forbade their attorneys from taking January 6th cases ... Not a single J6er was acquitted by a D.C. jury.\"\n\n\"Third, the assertion that anyone got a 'fair' sentence is garbage. During the violent riots at President Trump's own inauguration in 2016, police and police property were attacked. But instead of prosecuting those who were arrested for violence, charges were dropped against over 200 of them.\"\n\n\"Further, there was no accountability for the police who were responsible for provoking the violence by throwing stun and tear gas grenades into a peaceful crowd, which initiated the 'riot' in the first place ...\"\n\n\"In 2016, President Obama inaugurated a monument on the National Mall to the 'Stonewall Riots,' where New York police officers were violently attacked-and intentionally targeted for murder by being held in a building and having it set on fire. That behavior-far removed from a cop getting hit with a flagpole earning a brutal four-year prison sentence-was excused and lionized because it was 'provoked.'\n\n\"And finally, President Trump campaigned explicitly on issuing these pardons. The American people made their judgment and elected him ...\"\n\nI disagree with Braynard's argument, but his viewpoint has not been widely aired."

      "text": "Republicans join Democrats in celebrating violent rioters\n\nJan. 6 , 2021, was not a day of peaceful protest at the Capitol . It was a riot, in which mobs of hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the seat of our government, smashed windows, and assaulted police with the intention of overturning Trump's loss in the 2020 elections.\n\nMany rioters came armed, some with guns, others with zip-tie handcuffs, with the intention of harming lawmakers and the vice president of the United States.\n\nIt is also true that some Jan. 6 defendants were overcharged and oversentenced. Likewise, Jan. 6 participants received more scrutiny and less mercy than did the looters and rioters during the protests against police in the summer of 2020.\n\nInto this nuanced and politically charged dynamic entered President Donald Trump, who, on his first day back in the White House, pardoned every single Jan. 6 convict except for 14 leaders of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, whose sentences he commuted without providing a full pardon.\n\nTrump's base applauded the decision as a just response, freeing political prisoners from the \"Biden regime.\"\n\nThe discussion about Jan. 6 has been dominated by extreme views and simplistic characterizations by both Trump's supporters and his denigrators. A more nuanced picture is needed to judge Trump's blanket pardon.\n\nAt the north door of the Capitol on the morning of Jan. 6, one protester - I don't know his name - turned to the men around him and began plotting how to breach the line of Capitol Police and gain entrance to the Capitol. \"Someone pull down the little guy,\" I heard the man say as he pointed at the shortest police officer in the doorway, \"then sweep the big guy's leg, then bam, a wedge right through.\"\n\nThis plan got scuttled, but nevertheless, the crowd persisted in trying to breach the line of police and storm the Capitol through this door.\n\nSoon, protesters in tactical gear and wielding pepper spray began to push against the line of officers while ringleaders with megaphones yelled, \"Push! Push!\" encouraging the crowd to join in this effort physically to overwhelm the Capitol Police with violence.\n\nTheir aim was to break into the Capitol and disrupt the joint session of Congress convened to ratify Joe Biden's victory in the Electoral College. Based on conspiracy theories peddled by Trump, these people believed Biden had stolen the election.\n\nAt one point, a few of the rioters got tired of pushing and decided to pull - grabbing a U.S. Capitol Police officer and dragging him down the steps from the Senate door. Among the cheering protesters, one wielded a pitchfork.\n\nThis was the scene I took in for a couple of hours that afternoon, and this was one of the calmest, safest parts of the Capitol.\n\nElsewhere on the grounds, the protesters carried guns and smashed windows to break the building. One swiped a police billy club, which he used to beat officers. Others hunted down lawmakers and stole property.\n\nRioter Peter Stager wielded an American flag as a weapon and used it to beat a police officer who was lying prone on the ground. You don't have to trust the crooked FBI on this. You can watch the video and witness for yourself Stager swinging the pole up vertically over his head and then whacking down onto the prone officer. Then again. And again.\n\nWhat was Stager up to? In his own words: \"Every single one of those Capitol law enforcement officers, death is the remedy, that is the only remedy they get.\" If you take him at his word, Stager was there to kill Capitol Police and Washington officers.\n\nThis was also Stager's prescription for congressmen, senators, and then-Vice President Mike Pence. \"Everybody in there is a disgrace,\" Stager allegedly said of the building he was trying to storm. \"That entire building is filled with treasonous traitors. Death is the only remedy for what's in that building.\"\n\nStager pleaded guilty to various crimes. His sentence was four years. Trump pardoned him, of course.\n\nMark Mazza traveled from Indianapolis to Washington for the Jan. 6 protest. Mazza brought two guns but lost one of them somewhere at the Capitol.\n\nHere's what else federal prosecutors say about his protest: \"While armed with [a] .40 caliber loaded firearm,\" Mazza \"engaged in multiple efforts to break through the police line: He repeatedly pushed against officers using the combined physical exertion of the mob; he armed himself with a stolen police baton and assaulted officers with the baton.\"\n\nI'm leaving out some of Mazza's offenses here. He was sentenced to five years in prison. But Trump pardoned him.\n\nI choose these cases not because they are typical, nor because they are the worst cases. The cases of Stager and Mazza are useful because they destroy the MAGA myth that Jan. 6 was in essence a peaceful protest.\n\nIf you say, \"Police let them in, and they just wandered around,\" you are ignoring the J6ers who pushed past police while armed and beat them with clubs in order to breach the security lines.\n\nThese two cases are illustrative also because they show that some of the harsh sentences were warranted.\n\nHere's where the MAGA lament is true: Taken as a whole, the Jan. 6 offenders were prosecuted much more harshly because of the political valence of the protest.\n\nIf you were a rioter in Portland, Oregon, in the summer of 2020, you almost certainly were treated more leniently than a Jan. 6 rioter.\n\nWhile the FBI went to extreme lengths to hunt down every masked trespasser in the Capitol, officers and prosecutors gave up pretty quickly when George Floyd-inspired arsonists hid behind masks and the dark of night.\n\nAlso, as someone who was there that day, I can correct a common media representation: It's not true that all or even most of the folks at the Capitol that day were rioters or \"insurrectionists.\"\n\nWhile the Capitol lawn was off-limits to the public, it was easy to wander onto the property without knowing you were on \"restricted grounds.\" When I arrived at 2 p.m., I walked onto the lawn without hopping a fence or seeing a \"no trespassing\" sign.\n\nMost of the people on the Capitol grounds that day were not trying to breach the Capitol - many were drinking Yuenglings in lawn chairs they had carried from Trump's speech on the Ellipse.\n\nAnd if you entered the Capitol through certain doors at certain times, you may not have known that you were trespassing because the police may already have retreated from the door you used. In some cases, police stood back and allowed the protesters to walk the halls of the building - a scene captured in many security videos.\n\nThese protesters may have been foolish. They were breaking the law and probably should have known it. But jail time for nonviolent trespassers who left when told reeks of politicized prosecution.\n\nThe comparison to the post-Floyd riots and protests is also worth considering.\n\nA common MAGA misperception is that no left-wing protesters were prosecuted or jailed for their arson, looting, destruction of property, or assaults on police in the summer of 2020. The lenience by prosecutors was real but exaggerated. What might stick most in the craw of Trump supporters was not so much the prosecutorial treatment of Floyd protesters, but the media and political treatment of them as heroes.\n\nFamously, media outlets minimized the arson, the killing, the assault, and the looting, emphasizing only that the protests were \"mostly peaceful.\" Even at the protests right outside the White House, where I reported for a few nights that summer, rioters burned a church, torched local businesses, threw hard projectiles at police, and threatened the press (me) with violence for the offense of filming their actions.\n\nIn other cities, arson and looting were more rampant. Nevertheless, Kamala Harris, who would soon be tapped as the Democratic vice presidential nominee, raised funds for the legal defense of these rioters.\n\nOne media hero that summer was Philadelphia high school teacher and social justice activist Anthony Smith. Smith was already famous for vandalizing and tearing down a statue of former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo. After Floyd's death, Smith joined the riots, flipped over a police car, and joined other rioters in torching it.\n\nAfter his arrest, media and Democratic activists praised Smith, one calling him an \"outspoken community activist and a leader in the movement for black lives in Philadelphia.\"\n\n\"Free Ant\" became a cause, and the prosecution was blasted in the media as political persecution.\n\nOne of the men arrested with \"Ant\" for flipping and torching the police car was Carlos Matchett, who had traveled from Atlantic City, where he had called for riots and launched looting mobs.\n\nMatchett was held up by liberal nonprofit groups as a victim of overprosecution.\n\nIn the end, Smith got a one-year sentence, and Matchett got four years.\n\nCompare Matchett to Stager. Both rioted. One physically beat an officer and called for mass murder of police while taking part in a mob. The other led looting gangs, called for riots, and destroyed a police car. Both got four years. That seems equal and fitting.\n\nMore than 16,000 arrests were made in major U.S. cities related to those protests, with nearly 3,000 of those arrests for felonies. In some cities, prosecutors refused to prosecute all but the worst offenses (in Philadelphia, it was left to the U.S. government to prosecute Smith and Matchett).\n\nThe news media, meanwhile, minimized the damage. It was even considered racist to point out the property damage done by rioters. Most of the 1,100 Jan. 6 arrestees who have been sentenced were not charged with violence against people or property, according to a database maintained by the group Look Ahead, which defends the protesters and rioters as \"political prisoners.\"\n\nCertainly, some of these pardons are deserved. Likely, most rioters who served four years deserve some clemency. But to call all 1,500 arrestees \"political prisoners\" is false, just as it is false to claim nobody was prosecuted for torching cities or beating officers in George Floyd's name.\n\nAmerica's judicial system is inherently arbitrary, and so politics necessarily creeps in. There's no preventing that. But improving that system will require honest examination rather than blanket generalization."

      "text": "DC judges bash Trump's Jan. 6 pardons using evocative rhetoric\n\nIn the days since President Donald Trump 's sweeping pardons of over 1,500 defendants from the Jan. 6 riot , several federal judges have issued blistering rebukes, painting his clemency orders as an affront to justice.\n\nThe pardons, described by Trump as a step toward \"national reconciliation,\" have led federal judges in Washington, D.C., to issue fiery responses to defendants seeking to have the Trump Justice Department remove their cases from the docket.\n\nJudge Tanya Chutkan, an appointee of former President Barack Obama who oversaw Trump's 2020 election federal criminal case, issued one of the most graphic condemnations Wednesday as she dismissed a pending case against a Capitol rioter.\n\n\"This cannot whitewash the blood, feces, and terror that the mob left in its wake,\" Chutkan wrote in a filing for defendant John Banuelo. \"And it cannot repair the jagged breach in America's sacred tradition of peacefully transitioning power.\"\n\nChutkan went on to highlight the judiciary's work in holding over 1,000 rioters accountable, emphasizing that the historical record of these cases must remain unaltered as a testament and warning.\n\nJudge Beryl Howell, the former chief judge of the D.C. District Court appointed by Obama, also weighed in, sharply criticizing Trump's justification for the mass pardons.\n\n\"No 'process of national reconciliation' can begin when poor losers, whose preferred candidate loses an election, are glorified for disrupting a constitutionally mandated proceeding in Congress and doing so with impunity,\" Howell wrote in a filing for Proud Boys member Nicholas Ochs. \"That merely raises the dangerous specter of future lawless conduct by other poor losers and undermines the rule of law.\"\n\nHowell dismissed several pending cases this week at the request of the Justice Department, which no longer seeks to prosecute them under Trump's directive. However, Howell and Chutkan refused to dismiss certain cases \"with prejudice,\" leaving the possibility open for future prosecution. One of these cases involved a chapter leader of the Proud Boys extremist group.\n\nJudge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, a Clinton appointee, offered her own pointed remarks in a response to defendant Dominic Box's case dismissal Wednesday, saying no presidential proclamation could erase the truth of Jan. 6.\n\n\"Dismissal of charges, pardons after convictions, and commutations of sentences will not change the truth of what happened,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Those records are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies,\" she said, praising the law enforcement officers who stood against the mob, saying, \"Standing with bear spray streaming down their faces, those officers carried out their duty to protect.\"\n\nThe sharpest remarks of the week came Thursday from Judge Amy Berman Jackson, an Obama appointee who blasted the notion of dismissing cases with prejudice.\n\n\"Such a dismissal would dishonor the hundreds of law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line against impossible odds to protect not only the U.S. Capitol building and the people who worked there - who were huddled inside in terror as windows and doors were shattered - but to protect the very essence of democracy: the peaceful transfer of power.\" Jackson added, \"Patriotism is loyalty to country and loyalty to the Constitution - not loyalty to a single head of state.\"\n\nTrump's pardons, issued late Monday, released convicted rioters from federal prisons and halted prosecutions for hundreds of pending cases. In his executive order, Trump called the prosecutions a \"grave national injustice\" and framed his action as a corrective measure.\n\n\"It was a terrible time and a terrible chapter in America's history,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said in defense of the pardons. \"The president made his decision. I don't second guess those.\"\n\nSome firebrand supporters of Trump slammed the judges for engaging in \"political rhetoric\" from their chambers and further alleged that their rhetoric against the defendants was emblematic that they were never treated fairly during their legal proceedings.\n\nFor instance, Jesse Franklin-Murdock, counsel for the Dhillon Law Group, said Chutkan's remarks \"neither explain her decision nor clarify the law. She is using the imprimatur of her office to engage in political rhetoric.\"\n\n\"If she can't apply the law to a J6er without condemning them, how can it be said that J6ers and Trump received due process in her courtroom?\" the attorney wrote on X.\n\nConservative journalist Julie Kelly, who was touted by Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk as having played a major role in advising Trump on pardons, called for the judges to be investigated, adding \"impeach or reassign them all\" in a post on X.\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department has begun notifying victims of the riot, including police officers, about the releases.\n\nAquilino Gonell, a former U.S. Capitol Police sergeant who testified about the attack, shared his frustration on social media.\n\n\"Each email and call log is a different violent rioter who assaulted me in the tunnel,\" Gonell wrote.\n\n\"If you are defending these people who brutally assaulted the police, maybe you ARE NOT a supporter of the police and the rule of law to begin with,\" he added."

Rep.

Beyond this, the Justice Department has been conducting a sprawling investigation into the organization of the riot and coinciding efforts to challenge the 2020 election. On Thursday, a judge handed down a 10-year sentence against a former police officer for various charges related to the riot - the longest sentencing in a Jan. 6 case so far.\n\nTrump's remarks come as Biden is slated to deliver a prime-time speech in Philadelphia about \"the continued battle for the soul of the nation\" and warn about extremist threats to the United States from within.\n\nDuring the interview with Bell, Trump also appeared to pitch a new theory about why the FBI \"invaded\" his Mar-a-Lago estate last month: that the bureau was on the hunt for Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\n\"This thing has brought us together, but I think they were looking for Hillary Clinton emails. I really think - I think they thought and, who knows, you know, boxes full of stuff.

An underlying affidavit said the \"government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment or removal of government records.\" The affidavit also noted there was \"probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found.\"\n\nTrump, who denies wrongdoing, decried the raid as an \"unAmerican break-in.\" In public, Trump claims he declassified the material stashed in Mar-a-Lago, though his lawyers said in a filing on Wednesday that they agree with the government that \"it would be appropriate for the special master to possess a Top Secret/SCI security.\""

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), the lone lawmaker seeking judicial fairness for suspects in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots, criticized her colleagues for failing to back legislative reforms to block \"political prosecutions.\"\n\nIn an interview with Secrets , the lawmaker said, \"It should be a Republican priority. And it's not. It's not because they really don't care.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, during a driving rain shower, Greene announced that she was reintroducing legislation to reform how defendants arrested in political protests are handled. She has charged that non-violent Jan. 6 suspects and those found guilty of a range of riot-related charges have faced overly harsh sentences and jail conditions.\n\nCongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Holds a Press Conference on the Introduction of the \"Matthew LawrencePerna Act of 2024.\" https://t.co/4ExP2f4FKZ\n\nHer Matthew Lawrence Perna Act is named after Matthew Perna, a 37-year-old Sharpsville, Pennsylvania , man who committed suicide while waiting to be sentenced for non-violently entering the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when riots suspended the certification of President Joe Biden's election.\n\nHis family said that the government's plan to add more charges to his case pushed him into depression, and he committed suicide.\n\nThe legislation is a copy of a bill introduced in 2022 by former Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-TX). A key element of both would allow a change of venue to move trials out of Washington, D.C., where over 90% vote Democrat and support the prosecution of riot suspects.\n\nGreene said that even former President Donald Trump, who has promised to pardon some of those convicted in Jan. 6 cases, would benefit by having his 2020-election related trial in Washington moved.\n\nAt an outdoor press conference, Greene appeared with Perna's aunt, Geri Perna, who joined in condemning congressional members for not cosponsoring the legislation. Later, she wrote on X, \"Thank you @RepMTG for being the ONLY Republican in congress who gives a sh-t about the J6ers!\"\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nGreene noted that while Republicans have assailed the findings of the Democratic House Jan. 6 investigation, they have failed to back her legislation. \"I'm just so frustrated here. You know, last Congress, I called it the 'House of hypocrites.' And I think the name still applies,\" she told us.\n\nThank you @RepMTG for being the ONLY Republican in congress who gives a shit about the J6ers! @RepAndyBiggsAZ @RepBoebert @Jim_Jordan @RepThomasMassie @RepDonaldsPress @RepMattGaetz @RepNancyMace @RepTroyNehls @RepClayHiggins @EliseStefanik @RepRalphNorman @GOP https://t.co/lHzFSIesD9\n\nGreene said that she expected the issue to get more sunshine in Congress if Trump is elected back into the White House in the fall. \"You know how this game works. It won't become important to Republicans on the Hill until President Trump is in the White House and is actually doing something about it,\" said Greene, who has also visited with Jan. 6 defendants in jail."

      "text": "Jan. 6 defendants rally for Trump pardons on riot anniversary\n\nOn the fourth anniversary of the Jan. 6 , 2021, Capitol riot, convicted and awaiting defendants are making their final appeals for presidential clemency ahead of President-elect Donald Trump 's return to the Oval Office.\n\nMany defendants are pinning their hopes on Trump's repeated promises to issue pardons , though the details of how he will fulfill these pledges remain uncertain.\n\nA group that calls itself a federal watchdog and \"anti-lawfare legal group\" is hosting a conference Monday to commemorate the anniversary and demand pardons for the nearly 1,600 defendants who have been charged, a sign of the pressure Trump is facing to deliver for them.\n\n\"The January 6 Community of persecuted patriots stands united in a single goal: to ensure every J6 Hostage is Pardoned by President Trump on Day One,\" the group's website states.\n\nOn the conference's guest list are those from a right-wing faction of Trump's base, including MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, influencer and defendant Isabella DeLuca, Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft, and Herneitha \"Silk\" Richardson of Diamond and Silk.\n\nAnother guest attending the panel is Jan. 6 defendant Daniel Goodwyn, a self-proclaimed Proud Boys member who received a 60-day prison term for briefly entering the U.S. Capitol and was subjected to internet monitoring by a judge who found he engaged in spreading misinformation.\n\nI'm @DanielGoodwyn , San Francisco, California Patriot and J6 Political Hostage, Federal Inmate 27932509. We're only accepting Trump J6 pardons if we ALL get them-regardless of the sham charges. No man left behind! Free ALL J6ers! Before we elected him, he promised them for Day 1! pic.twitter.com/HVCGXcyfJY\n\n\"We're only accepting Trump J6 pardons if we ALL get them - regardless of the sham charges,\" Goodwyn said in a video posted to X in November. \"No man left behind! Free ALL J6ers! Before we elected him, he promised them for Day 1!\"\n\nJonathan Mellis, another member of the Proud Boys, is also among the group asking Trump to act swiftly. Facing up to 10 years in prison for his involvement in the riot, Mellis has implored Trump to pardon all Jan. 6 defendants, particularly high-profile figures such as Enrique Tarrio and Stewart Rhodes, the former Proud Boys leader and Oath Keepers leader, respectively.\n\n\"Enrique Tarrio and Stewart Rhodes need to be pardoned, and every other J6 defendant needs to be pardoned too because we've been persecuted and treated inhumanely by a government that has been weaponized against patriots,\" Mellis told the Washington Examiner .\n\nWhile Trump has publicly pledged to issue pardons \"on Day One,\" his recent comments have suggested a more nuanced approach. In a Time interview, Trump said he would review cases individually, differentiating between nonviolent offenders and those who engaged in more extreme actions.\n\nBut Jan. 6 defendant Bunky Crawford speculated Trump or his advisers may not want to spend the time analyzing hours of riot footage for the nearly 1,600 defendants.\n\n\"Even my own family, my own parents, won't take the time to just sit and really look at all the videos,\" Crawford told the Washington Examiner . \"The people that love me the most really won't sit down and dissect these videos and really look at what happened.\"\n\nCrawford is scheduled to be sentenced this week and is one of several accused of assaulting police officers, though he contends he was acting in self-defense amid the chaotic riot.\n\nMike Davis, founder of the Article III Project and a vocal advocate of the defendants, argued the importance of widespread clemency for the defendants, but he stopped short of saying every one of them should receive a pardon in a statement to the Washington Examiner .\n\nDavis maintains that \"nothing that happened on Jan. 6 calls for a 22-year prison sentence, especially when the Biden Justice Department essentially gave amnesty to the much more deadly and destructive BLM and ANTIFA rioters.\"\n\n\"I have very publicly advised President Trump to pardon almost all Jan. 6 defendants and commute the sentences for those who were violent against police officers and similar bad acts to more reasonable sentences,\" said Davis, who has touted himself as an unofficial \"viceroy\" to Trump.\n\nYet Trump's public statements on this front leave many questions unanswered. Defense attorneys representing Jan. 6 defendants have expressed frustration over the lack of clear guidelines, particularly as they scramble to ensure their clients are included in any clemency grants.\n\nBill Shipley, a longtime attorney who has defended dozens of Jan. 6 defendants, told the Washington Examiner he believed most of his clients would be worthy of pardons based on their offenses. He said the sentiment among them was that they were optimistic but also uncertain.\n\n\"I don't think anybody has any expectations,\" Shipley said. \"They've all paid attention to what President-elect Trump has said, and I think their expectation is he's going to act consistent with what he said. What that actually entails is still a mystery.\"\n\nThe cases of Tarrio and Rhodes, both convicted of seditious conspiracy and sentenced to about two decades in prison each, have drawn significant attention. Tarrio, who was not present in Washington on Jan. 6, was convicted of leading efforts to incite violence. Rhodes was found guilty of plotting to bring weapons to the Capitol area, though he did not breach the building or engage in physical confrontations.\n\nTarrio's attorney, Nayib Hassan, expressed optimism that his client would be considered for clemency.\n\n\"We look forward to what the future holds, both in terms of the judicial process for our client and the broader political landscape under the new administration,\" Hassan said in a statement.\n\nJames Lee Bright, Rhodes's attorney, has also said he believes his client deserves clemency. \"The worst thing visually that the man did was take pictures,\" Bright said, according to CNN. \"If [Trump] is a man of his word, then with the swipe of a pen, that's something he should do.\"\n\nThe prospect of broad pardons has drawn criticism from judges who have overseen Jan. 6 cases. Judge Royce Lamberth, a Reagan appointee, recently rebuked attempts to portray the rioters as political prisoners, emphasizing their role in an \"attempt to subvert the will of an electoral majority.\"\n\nAt least 1,561 people have faced federal charges related to the riot. The majority have pleaded guilty or been convicted in trials, and about 645 have been sentenced to prison time. Many have already served their sentences, but a pardon could still benefit them because it would restore any civil rights they lost as a result of their charges.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), the incoming ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, opposes Trump's pardon plans, which would effectively undo one of the largest-scale and most resource-intensive prosecutions in Justice Department history.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat, who sat on the now-defunct Jan. 6 committee, said on a recent call with reporters that if Trump were to issue blanket pardons to categories of defendants, the president-elect would have no way to tell which defendants were remorseful and no longer a danger to the public, which, according to Raskin, is critical for clemency eligibility.\n\n\"If it is actually going to happen, people should demand a very specific accounting of how there is contrition and repentance on the part of each of the people being pardoned,\" Raskin said.\n\n\"There should also be an affirmative statement that they pose no further threat to the public safety, because anything that happens by these people, whether it's in a political context or some other context, will essentially be laid at the doorstep of soon-to-be President Donald Trump,\" he said."

      "text": "Tucker Carlson's Jan. 6 video doesn't exonerate the rioters\n\nT he video Tucker Carlson released last week of Jake Angeli, also known as Jacob Chansley or the \"QAnon Shaman,\" caused quite a controversy last week. It revealed an entirely different series of events than what the Jan. 6 Committee shared with the public. Many think the committee purposely hid this footage. And, from a legal standpoint, there could be ramifications if accusations are true that the committee didn't provide the lawyers of those arrested with all the available video for trial preparation. But we must also understand that Carlson's video doesn't exonerate the rioters who broke the law.\n\nFor example, consider this tweet by Juanita Broaddrick , one of the women who claimed Bill Clinton raped her while he was Arkansas's attorney general. On Sunday, Broaddrick tweeted an image with the silhouette of a person by the Capitol with the words \"Bring our J6ers home\" encircled around it. It's this kind of messaging that is wrong. People who break the law must be held accountable, regardless of which political ideology motivated their actions.\n\nBIDEN'S CLIMATE-OBSESSED BUDGET IS WRONG FOR THE COUNTRY\n\npic.twitter.com/nWKvVNOH4d\n\n- Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) March 12, 2023\n\nIt would seem this would be a logical assertion, but chatter on numerous talk shows, and especially social media, seemed to imply, if not outright suggest, the Jan. 6 \"prisoners\" should be released or excused as a result of Carlson's video. However, that's just not true. Just as everyone who looted and assaulted people during the Black Lives Matter riots of 2020 should be held accountable for their actions, so should the people who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6. Justice just can't be one way.\n\nNow some have argued that the criminals and agitators from the 2020 BLM riots were treated less harshly than those on Jan. 6. If true, this needs to be addressed. Such an occurrence would undoubtedly be wrong, and the outrage would be justified. However, no one should be suggesting otherwise because they were just as bad, if not arguably worse, than those from Jan. 6. And if this is true, then it should be investigated, and those who allowed it should suffer the consequences. However, that is an entirely different conversation than claiming the people arrested because of their participation on Jan. 6 should be acquitted, forgiven, or completely let off the hook.\n\nConservatives and Republicans can't claim they are the people who favor law and order and support the police but then don't think those who broke into the Capitol and rioted should face any repercussions. The Democrats selectively editing videos and releasing them to the public does warrant anger and outrage. And it certainly raises many credibility problems regarding the Jan. 6 Committee. But none of this changes the fact that rioters illegally entered a federal building and caused harm to many police officers.\n\nRioting, looting, causing destruction, and assaulting police officers are wrong. This doesn't change because of political allegiances. And while it doesn't justify any wrongdoing by the Jan. 6 Committee, which appeared to use the footage as propaganda to create a particular narrative, no one should think Carlson's video somehow makes those who broke the law on Jan. 6 innocent. There is right, and there is wrong, and we must always remember this."

Vance said over the weekend that the president is likely to start with those who faced or were convicted of charges of trespassing and other nonviolent acts.\n\n3 days before Christmas the FBI busted open the door to his home and shot out the glass door in his bedroom.

There's a little bit of a gray area there, but we're very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law. And there are a lot of people we think in the wake of Jan. 6 who were prosecuted unfairly. We need to rectify that,\" said Vance.\n\nTrump has been unclear on exactly who will get an initial pardon. Several key allies, notably Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), have sought a pardon for all involved, arguing that they've been in jail long enough.\n\nShe and others have said that the Jan. 6 felons deserve to be treated better, and she has compared their treatment to the hands-off approach to violent Black Lives Matter and antifa rioters.\n\n\"That's what I'm going to push for, even the Jan. 6 defendants that are serving time in prison right now, whether they fought with police officers or pushing and shoving in the tunnel. Maybe they even did damage, broke a window, and climbed in the Capitol. I think they've served enough time. They didn't kill anybody, they didn't rape anybody, they didn't invade our country like all these illegal aliens. I think they've served enough time, and they're political hostages,\" Greene recently told Secrets.\n\n\"My view is every single one of them needs to be pardoned and released. And you know when I always say this, compare it to antifa and BLM rioters and protesters. Over 95% of charges dropped, let these people out of prison, give them their lives back. It's time. It's been too much,\" she added.\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nLook Ahead America Executive Director Matt Braynard said Monday, \"We applaud J.D. Vance's commitment to those who, in his words, were 'provoked' or received 'garbage trials.' The new administration represents a rising sun, pushing back the dark night of injustice that America has endured under the Biden administration.\"\n\nIn a statement revealing the numbers of those involved in the dragnet, he added, \"There are currently 1,593 Americans who've been arrested by the Biden administration's Department of Justice. 961 of them have not been charged with any violent acts, and many of those charged with 'violence' face trumped-up or false accusations from corrupt prosecutors. J6ers who have gone to trial have endured abuse from prosecutors and judges who willfully based their decisions on documented lies. While left-wing protesters who engaged in identical actions during past protests received mere slaps on the wrist, the J6 patriots have faced over-prosecution and -sentencing so egregious that even the Supreme Court ruled it was unconstitutional.\""

      "text": "White House Report Card: A target in motion is harder to hit\n\nPresident Donald Trump is proving the old adage that a target in motion is a lot harder to hit than a target at rest.\n\nWhen Democratic pollster John Zogby , one of our two graders for the White House Report Card, delivered his grade this week, I noted his long list of actions taken by Trump this week.\n\nWhile Zogby's grade was a disapproving \"D\" for the week, I said, \"At least you've got to agree he isn't standing still,\" to which Zogby responded, \"He is not standing still!!!\"\n\nThe highlights this week were led by Trump's aggressive joint session speech to Congress and his on-and-off tariff threats . But every day, he also unleashed a list of other orders, from threats to Iran for seeking a nuclear weapon to ending a $400 million subsidy to Columbia University , which is sitting on a $14 billion endowment.\n\nAlso notably, this week, Trump offered up DOGE chief Elon Musk to angry House and Senate Republicans and the Cabinet to yell at for moving too quickly and secretively to ax federal fat. For now, all appear satisfied that Musk will use a scalpel instead of a chainsaw to eliminate waste.\n\nOverall, Zogby wasn't approving of Trump's week, but said the Democrats and their protests were worse. Conservative grader Jed Babbin offered a promising \"B,\" pleased that the president threatened economic actions against Russia over the war in Ukraine.\n\nJed Babbin\n\nGrade: B\n\nPresident Donald Trump had a very good week, beginning with his Tuesday night speech to a joint session of Congress and ending with sanction threats against Russia for its continued attacks on Ukraine. He further threatened Hamas terrorists if they didn't quickly return all of its Oct. 7 hostages.\n\nIn his Tuesday address, Trump continued to lay out his aggressive agenda, and the Democrats made fools of themselves. They held up little paddles with the words \"lies,\" false,\" and \"Musk steals\" on them. Rep. Al Green (D-TX) was thrown out of the House chamber for standing up and shouting at Trump.\n\nRemember that the catch-all felony that landed many J6ers in prison and carries a max of 20 years is obstruction of an official proceeding. (18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2)). Al Green's toddler antics certainly qualifies as obstructing an official proceeding. pic.twitter.com/fLJ36NP1Ln\n\nThe Democrats are left without any response to Trump. All they can say is, \"Orange man bad,\" without any policy suggestions to counter his agenda. It's proof that the party is bankrupt: no ideas, no policies, and nothing to counter Trump.\n\nThe president this week also threatened massive sanctions against Russia for its constant attacks on Ukraine. Those sanctions could include (but probably won't) sanctions against European nations that still buy natural gas from Moscow. Trump canceled intelligence-sharing with Ukraine which the Brits and French will try to compensate for.\n\nTrump threatened Hamas with an end to their existence if they didn't release hostages from its horrific Oct. 7, 2023 attack. Trump has made this threat before and hasn't done anything to enforce it. His hands, like those of the Israelis, are pretty much tied. He can't carpet bomb Gaza because it would kill too many people, and Hamas would kill more hostages if he did. He can't send the 101st Airborne or the First Marine Division into Gaza for the same reason. Hamas responded that they won't release the hostages until there's a permanent cease-fire and Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. The Israelis won't do that, and Trump is left with an almost-empty threat. He needs to figure out how to get the hostages freed. Maybe send in SEALs and Delta Force?\n\nTrump's agenda suffered several setbacks in court this week, with the Supreme Court holding that stopping payment on USAID grants and such was unconstitutional because the money was appropriated by Congress. Trump will try to get around the decision, but it'll be very tough to do.\n\nJohn Zogby\n\nGrade: D\n\nPresident Donald Trump did not give the greatest speech in American history, but it did accomplish what it set out to do. He offered a morale lift to his base just as he demoralized Democrats in the room and across the nation. Trump not only swatted dead the Democratic bug, he ground it into the carpet. The party of FDR and JFK was reduced to holding silly paddles where the only thing missing was the elastic band and rubber ball that would hit them in the head when they missed.\n\nBest line of Trump's speech tonight is right here. Well done. pic.twitter.com/mvxgf0YHEl\n\nHis joint session speech was filled with braggadocio, exaggerations, and outright lies. Good thing that fact-checkers are not employed by the federal government, now on a Trump firing binge. He exploited silly things (a litany of wasted spending by Social Security, for example) and taunted Democrats for pushing immigration legislation to fix the border crisis when all the nation \"really needed was a new president.\"\n\nHe touted his actions on gender, border enforcement, a peace deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war, more oil and gas drilling, removal of  the \"poison of critical race theory in schools\" (where it doesn't actually exist!), and reciprocal tariffs. He promised action on initiatives on a Golden Dome missile defense, autism, domestically produced microchips. He basked in the moments when he told human interest stories, (which were very moving).\n\nHe was bolstered by taunting Democrats, including one who rolled her eyes when the Secret Service director honored a 13-year-old boy suffering from brain cancer with an honorary agency badge. A key Trump moment came when a cane-holding Rep. Al Green (D-TX) was booted from the chamber for protesting the speech.\n\nHis polling numbers, however, did not move an inch one way or another, and other than the speech, Trump had a terrible week. The stock market plummeted; he changed his position on tariffs a few times in as many days; he angered veterans by laying them off from federal jobs; he watched as the Centers for Disease Control had to hire back 180 workers who were dumped so they could deal with a serious measles outbreak; he imposed limits on DOGE Captain Elon Musk when there was rebellion from his own Cabinet who were seeing serious pushback from the public; and he lost a major Supreme Court decision which ordered reinstatement of payments for USAID contractors.\n\nSEE THE LATEST POLITICAL NEWS AND BUZZ FROM WASHINGTON SECRETS\n\nPlus, the February jobs report was underwhelming for a second consecutive month, and now we are hearing talk of a \"forced recession to reduce inflation.\"\n\nHe would have gotten an even lower grade, but the \"F\" is reserved for the Democrats this week.\n\nJed Babbin is a Washington Examiner contributor and former deputy undersecretary of defense in the administration of former President George H.W.

      "text": "DOJ presses forward with charging Jan. 6 defendants in lame-duck administration\n\nThe Department of Justice has brought new charges against several Jan. 6 defendants in the wake of Donald Trump 's election victory, even as the president-elect signals that his DOJ will take a sharp turn away from prosecutions related to the riot when he takes office in less than two months.\n\nThe DOJ has continued to project a business-as-usual approach to its yearslong Jan. 6 operation, charging and arresting people at its typical pace. But the newest cases may not get very far in the court process, as Trump has said the prosecutions are \"political persecution\" and indicated they will grind to a halt the moment he is in the White House.\n\nSince Trump won, the DOJ and FBI have focused on pursuing those accused of felonies, and not merely misdemeanors, according to public activity and media reports.\n\nFederal authorities, for example, arrested two men from Florida on Monday in connection with the riot. The pair were charged in a complaint with multiple felonies, including assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon. The weapon, according to the charging documents, was a large metal Trump sign that the two men and others allegedly used as a \"battering ram\" against police officers.\n\nAuthorities arrested another man, a 56-year-old from Virginia, last week and charged him with two felonies after he was seen on camera shoving a police officer and shouting expletives at the officer, according to charging documents.\n\nThe U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., which has been overseeing all of the DOJ's Jan. 6 prosecutions, declined to comment on any changes to the department's approach in light of Trump's election. The FBI said in response to a request for comment that its \"investigations into federal violations continue\" and did not specify any shift in priorities.\n\nAn unnamed federal law enforcement official recently indicated to NBC News that prosecutors were, indeed, avoiding arresting people solely for misdemeanors because of Trump's win. In internal guidance, prosecutors were reportedly told to \"focus on the most egregious conduct and cases until the end of the administration.\"\n\nProsecutors have charged more than 1,500 people in connection to the riot, but the FBI still has hundreds of suspects on its Jan. 6 wanted list.\n\nThe new cases that have been brought or unsealed following Trump's win come as the DOJ also continues in court to object to a wave of requests from defendants seeking pauses on their court proceedings because they anticipate Trump will pardon them or drop their charges.\n\nTrump has vowed to grant clemency to a \"large portion\" of those who have been found guilty of Jan. 6-related crimes. For those who have been charged but not yet made it to trial, his DOJ could use its prosecutorial discretion to ask the court to dismiss the charges.\n\nLast week, federal authorities arrested a California man on felony charges, alleging he wrestled a bike rack away from a police officer and had several other physical interactions with officers as he entered the Capitol. Also last week, a judge unsealed a case that revealed authorities had charged a man named Jeffrey Snyder last month for allegedly wielding a taser in the riot crowd and emptying a can of bear spray on an officer.\n\nBill Shipley, a longtime attorney who has represented dozens of the defendants, said he felt the DOJ was displaying misplaced priorities by continuing to charge people and by continuing to push judges to keep current defendants on fast-moving court schedules.\n\n\"They're denying reality,\" Shipley told the Washington Examiner . \"They're basically saying, 'Well, it's our toy for another seven weeks, so we're going to keep playing with it.'\"\n\nWilliam Pope, a defendant charged with misdemeanors, was one of the few defendants who successfully convinced a judge to halt his court proceedings in anticipation of Trump dropping his case. Days after the election, Pope issued a vague warning on X regarding the DOJ's persistence.\n\n\"If Merrick Garland's DOJ continues pursuing retribution against J6ers all the way up until the inauguration, they know what they can expect in return immediately after the inauguration,\" Pope wrote.\n\nShipley said that in terms of those who are facing misdemeanors, the DOJ should not at this stage advance those cases at all because it was a waste of valuable legal resources.\n\n\"They're tying up court resources for cases that are almost assuredly not going forward,\" Shipley said. \"And then the defendants have to retain counsel, and counsel has to get involved and put aside time and make appearances and arrangements and deal with the government and obtain discovery.\""

      "text": "Trump Vows To Probe Ashli Babbitt Homicide, Consider Comp Fund For Pardoned J6ers\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday vowed that he would bring new scrutiny to the Department of Justice's handling of the killing of Ashli Babbitt by a Capitol police officer during the Jan 6, 2021 riot, and to explore the possibility of a compensation fund for the 1,500 Capitol riot defendants he pardoned.\n\nTrump's promises came in a Roosevelt Room interview with Newsmax's Greg Kelly. When Kelly asked Trump about the DOJ continuing to mount a defense against a $30 million wrongful death claim filed by Babbitt's husband, Trump said he wasn't aware of it but would look into the matter:\n\n\"Well, I'll look into that. I mean, you're just telling me that for the first time, I haven't heard that. I'm a big fan of Ashli Babbitt. And Ashli Babbitt was a really good person who was a big MAGA fan, Trump fan. And she was innocently standing there ; they even say trying to sort of hold back the crowd. And a man did something to her that was unthinkable when he shot her. And I think it's a disgrace . I'm going to look into that. I did not know that.\"\n\nBabbitt was shot and killed by US Capitol Police (USCP) Lieutenant Michael Byrd as she attempted to climb through a broken window that was part of an interior doorway close to the House chamber. Though the unarmed, 5'2\", 115-pound Babbitt posed no imminent threat of inflicting death or serious injury as she awkwardly navigated the narrow space -- with a furniture barricade still ahead of her --  Boyd opted against using any type of nonlethal force, and instead shot her from an ambush position, killing her with a bullet that perforated her trachea and lung.\n\nWhile it's been little-publicized by major media or leftists who screech that Babbitt \"got what she deserved,\" Byrd had some serious disciplinary issues before Jan. 6 , with some of the incidents involving the irresponsible handling and even firing of his weapon.\n\nDespite the damning facts of the case, leftists in and out of media have treated Byrd as a hero for fending off a nonexistent \"insurrection.\" He was not only officially cleared of wrongdoing, but promoted to the rank of captain in 2023. In Tuesday's interview, Kelly also asked Trump how he felt about Byrd still being on duty, with a pay raise and higher rank. The president replied:\n\n\"I think it's a disgrace. I'm going to take a look at it. I'm going to look at that, too. His reputation was ... I won't even say; let's find out about his reputation. We're going to find out. But I watched that and I saw that. And by the way, she was killed, but nobody else was killed.\"\n\nNoting that the 1,500 Jan 6 defendants pardoned by Trump had \"lost opportunity, lost income,\" Kelly asked Trump if there was any plan in the works to compensate Jan 6ers for their excessively harsh treatment.  \"There's talk about that,\" said Trump. \"A lot of the people that are in the government now talk about it, because a lot of the people in government really like that group of people. They were patriots as far as I was concerned...they were treated very unfairly.\"\n\nPresident Trump addresses the latest on the case of Ashli Babbitt, the Trump supporter who was shot and killed at the Capitol on Jan 6, 2021, rips the police shooting, the overall treatment of now-pardoned defendants, and the actions of the former House J6 select committee. pic.twitter.com/kPXPyGVuJT\n\nGiven how the left went bonkers over Trump's pardons, the reaction to a reparations package for Jan 6ers would be a sight to behold.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

Plaintiffs were informed that the aggregated information is going to be forwarded to upper management,\" the FBI agents said in their lawsuit .\n\n\"Plaintiffs reasonably fear that all or parts of this list might be published by allies of President Trump, thus placing themselves and their families in immediate danger of retribution by the now pardoned and at-large Jan. 6 convicted felons,\" they said, arguing: \"Defendant's gathering, retention, and disclosure of Plaintiffs' activities related the acts of former President Trump is a violation of Plaintiffs' rights under the First Amendments to the Constitution.\"\n\nFBI Anonymous Lawsuit by Ken Silva\n\nThe FBI agents asked a federal judge to \"enjoin the aggregation, storage, reporting, publication or dissemination of any list or compilation of information that would identify FBI agents and other personnel, and tie them directly to Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago case activities.\"\n\nAlong with airing their grievances, the FBI agents retreaded disinformation about the Jan. 6 case that was spread by the Biden administration.\n\nFor example, they said J6ers acted violently at the urging of Donald Trump, when Trump specifically told them to remain peaceful.\n\nThe agents also falsely said rioters \"caused\" the fatality of a law enforcement officer, and that five police officers have died \"as a result of what transpired during the Jan. 6 attack.\" As has been widely documented, no police officers were killed by protestors. Officer Brian Sicknick was assaulted during the event, but he walked away from the protest and died the next day of natural causes.\n\n9 libtarded FBI agents recycle the same played-out lies.

      "text": "20 (Or So) Obvious Questions About January 6\n\nAuthored by Jack Cashill via American Thinker ,\n\nEven before Donald Trump ascends to the presidency on January 20, his appointees should ask themselves the questions that follow - all of them simple and straightforward. With Christopher Wray stepping down from the FBI directorship, they will have a much better chance of getting straight answers quickly.\n\nTrump's team should then share those answers widely. This information will make President Trump's pardon of more than 1,500 Americans much more comprehensible to the American public and much less controversial.\n\n-Although now the FBI admits to having 26 confidential human sources in the crowd on January 6, how many total \"assets\" did the FBI and other entities plant, and what roles did they play?\n\n- Was Ray Epps working for an entity? And if so, under what terms?\n\n-Who planted the pipe bombs outside the DNC and near the RNC headquarters?\n\n- Who instructed Kamala Harris to conceal the fact that she was at the DNC when the bomb was found and why?\n\n-Why did Harris allow hundreds of J6ers to be prosecuted for threatening her designated space at the Capitol when she wasn't at the Capitol?\n\n-Who were the \"two law enforcement officials\" who told the New York Times that \"pro-Trump rioters\" fatally struck Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick with a fire extinguisher, inflicting \"a bloody gash in his head\"?\n\n- Who orchestrated the 100-day-plus suppression of Sicknick's autopsy report?\n\n-If Sicknick was not murdered, as the DOJ finally conceded, why did a federal judge give Julian Khater an 80-month prison sentence for spritzing Sicknick with an over-the-counter pepper spray?\n\n- Has there been an official inquiry into the subsequent suicide deaths of four USCP officers , and if not, why has the DOJ routinely blamed the J6ers for causing those deaths?\n\n-Why was there no crime scene investigation in the likely homicide of Rosanne Boyland?\n\n-Who chose to ignore the obvious video evidence of Boyland being suffocated as a result of a police action and to falsely blame her death on an amphetamine overdose?\n\n- Who suppressed the Boyland autopsy report for 90 days and stonewalled her family at every turn?\n\n-Why was Lila Morris, the Metropolitan P.D. officer caught on video repeatedly bashing the unconscious Boyland over the head with a tree branch, not even disciplined?\n\n-Why was Metropolitan P.D. lieutenant Jason Bagshaw promoted despite having been caught on video bashing the defenseless Victoria White bloody?\n\n- Why did the DOJ not interview the eyewitnesses to the shooting death of Ashli Babbitt?\n\n-Why did the USCP coddle and promote Babbitt's killer, Michael Byrd, despite a shooting that, according to use-of-force expert Stan Kephart, \"violated not only the law but his oath\"?\n\n- Who ordered the \"shock and awe\" raids on the homes of hundreds of non-violent protesters and why?\n\n-Why has the so-called \"Scaffold Commander\" not been arrested despite multiple clear images of his face?\n\n-Why has the man who constructed the mock gallows on the Capitol grounds not been arrested despite multiple clear images of his face?\n\n- Why did the USCP allow the gallows to stand unmolested on Capitol grounds for more than four hours before the crowds gathered?\n\n-Why was Emanuel Jackson quickly set free despite having been caught on video swinging a baseball bat at police officers over a two-hour period?\n\n-If there was no insurrection, as the DOJ conceded, why were the sentences given to the J6ers so much more severe than the $30-50 fines given to the protesters who physically obstructed the Kavanaugh hearings?\n\nThese are the simple questions, the ones off the top. I am sure readers will think of others I may have overlooked.  To be sure, more probing questions need to be asked about the January 6 Select Committee report as well as the charging documents for the J6ers.\n\nHaving read through much of this material, I am impressed by how casually - and routinely - our elected officials and federal jurists distort the facts to protect the party line.  In short, they lie, and some have done so under oath.\n\nI am impressed, too, by the shamelessness of a DOJ that can boast of its success rate in securing convictions, knowing that the accused were allowed no change of venue and faced juries pulled from a pool 95 percent anti-Trump.  This needs to change.\n\nMore questions need to be asked as well about the security failures at all levels on January 6.  In his otherwise worthy book, Government Gangsters , Kash Patel more or less exonerates the Pentagon.  He should not have.  Incompetence explains much of what went wrong on January 6, but so does treason.\n\nNearly 1,600 American citizens were arrested for exercising their First Amendment rights on January 6, and roughly half of them have been incarcerated.  Save for the insurrectionists among them - if there were any - the rest deserve not just commutation of their sentences, but a full pardon.  Many may deserve compensation.  And all deserve the truth.\n\nTo learn more, see Jack Cashill's newest book, Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 .\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Nearly 4 Years Later, No Letup In Jan. 6 Prosecutions, Possible Pardons Or Not\n\nAuthored by Julie Kelly via RealClearInvestigations ,\n\nEven as President-elect Donald Trump promised on Sunday to act \"very quickly\" on pardons for many of the protesters involved in the events of January 6, the Biden administration's Justice Department is continuing to arrest and try people for actions that occurred almost four years ago while opposing motions to delay trials because of the need for \"the prompt and efficient administration of justice.\"\n\nIf the defeat of Kamala Harris constituted at least a partial repudiation of the lawfare against Trump and his supporters, the message appears to be lost on top brass at the DOJ. Prosecutors are pushing ahead with what they consider the department's crowning achievement: the so-called \"Capitol Siege\" investigation into the events of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn what Attorney General Merrick Garland describes as the biggest criminal investigation in Department of Justice history, more than 1,560 people have been charged for federal crimes never before used against political protesters , including under a post-Enron obstruction statute overturned by the Supreme Court in June. At least 1,000 of these defendants have been convicted - either at trial or by accepting plea offers -  with some 650 defendants ordered to serve time in a federal prison. Sentences range from a few days in jail to up to 22 years as the DOJ seeks \"terror enhancements\" to tack on additional time.\n\nActivity in the J6 investigation accelerated the month before the election. At least 16 individuals were arrested; home security camera footage obtained by RCI shows the heavily-armed pre-dawn FBI raid of a subject in California on October 17.\n\nShortly after the election, DOJ officials instructed attorneys working on J6 cases to carry on regardless of the pending change in leadership. \"[Federal] prosecutors in the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section received guidance this week about how to proceed in pending Jan. 6 cases ... including a directive to oppose any Jan. 6 defendant's requests for delays,\" Ryan J. Reilly of NBC News reported on Nov. 9. \"Prosecutors are instructed to argue that there is a societal interest in the quick administration of justice and these cases should be handled in the normal order.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Biden Justice Department is continuing to apprehend protesters. On Dec. 4, for example, the DOJ announced the arrest of a 44-year-old Alabama man, Robert James Bonham, charging him with a range of crimes, including \"assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers and obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder.\"\n\nIf Trump shuts down the department's \"Capitol Siege\" section, as he is expected to do, Bonham will never go to trial. But this does not appear to concern Matthew Graves, U. S. Attorney for the District of Columbia . Appointed by President Biden in November 2021, Graves has presided over the sprawling J6 investigation and now continues to advance related cases.\n\nHis office has opposed the J6 defendants' requests to halt proceedings until after Trump is sworn in next month. Judges began receiving a slew of defense motions starting the day after the election asking to postpone trials and hearings, but Graves said there is \"public interest in the prompt and efficient administration of justice\" as a reason to continue business as usual.\n\nFederal judges in Washington agree with the DOJ's approach . According to an analysis by RCI, 44 pardon-related motions including requests to delay trials and sentencings have been filed since November 6. Of those, judges, with the exception of Judge Rudolph Contreras, have denied each one. Several more are pending awaiting the court's decision.\n\nJudge Dabney Friedrich denied a motion to delay a J6 jury trial scheduled to begin the week after the election. Mitchell Bosch, a man from New York charged with several offenses, was set to go on trial on Nov. 13, but his public defenders filed a motion the day after the election  arguing their client \"cannot receive a fair trial in the District of Columbia six days from today due to the heightened public emotion and highly publicized media attention surrounding yesterday's presidential election, which resulted in the re-election of Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe attorneys noted that \"92.4% of the D.C. electorate voted for Vice President Kamala Harris, with only 6.7% voting for President-elect Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe attorneys further insisted disgruntled D.C. voters could retaliate with a conviction. \"If jurors believe that the President-elect is a threat to democracy, that he does not take the events of January 6, 2021, seriously, and that he will pardon those involved that day, there is a real and significant possibility that, in their aversion to those views, they will punish Mr. Bosch or use this case to send a message that they disagree with the President-elect.\"\n\nBut Friedrich, whose husband, Matthew, worked on the Enron task force with current Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, was unpersuaded. \"Despite the recent election, the Court continues to conclude that the Court's voir dire procedures will be adequate to screen out potential jurors who cannot be fair and impartial.\"\n\nAnd after a single day of deliberations, the jury returned guilty verdicts, two felonies and four misdemeanors, on Nov. 18. (The DOJ has a 100% conviction rate in J6 jury trials; no J6 defendant has been fully acquitted of all charges since trials began in March 2022. Judges also continue to deny all change-of-venue motions.)\n\nThree J6 jury trials are set to begin this week. For the trial of one of those defendants, a man charged with civil disorder and four misdemeanors, Judge Amy Berman Jackson recently entered an order allowing prosecutors to describe January 6 to jurors as an \"attack on the Capitol,\" \"attack on Congress,\" and a \"riot.\"\n\nBut political bias in the aftermath of Trump's election is not the only factor judges refuse to consider as they move J6 cases along. Trump's pledge to pardon most, if not all, J6ers also receives a cold reception in the E. Barrett Prettyman federal courthouse located a few blocks from the Capitol.\n\nThe day after the election, an attorney representing Christopher Carnell, who was convicted of nonviolent misdemeanors following a bench trial in February 2024, asked the judge in his case to delay a scheduled hearing based on the possibility of a pardon. \"Throughout his campaign, President-elect Trump made multiple clemency promises to the January 6 defendants, particularly to those who were nonviolent participants,\" attorney Marina Medvin wrote on Nov. 6. \"Mr. Carnell, who was an 18-year-old nonviolent entrant into the Capitol on January 6, is expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\"\n\nBut Beryl Howell, the former chief judge of the court, immediately rejected her request and set a sentencing hearing for Carnell this week.\n\nHer colleagues on the D.C. federal bench, citing either a public interest in continuing court proceedings or making separation of powers arguments, followed her lead with recent rulings:\n\nJudge Reggie Walton : \"[The] potential future exercise of the discretionary pardon power, an Executive Branch authority, is irrelevant to the Court's obligation to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Judicial Branch.\" - November 7 order denying motion to postpone sentencing.\n\nJudge Amit Mehta : \"Defendant's speculation that he may receive a pardon is not good cause to stay this matter.\" - November 11 order denying motion to continue trial.\n\nJudge Paul Friedman : \"Whatever the President-Elect may or may not do with respect to some of those charged for their conduct at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 is irrelevant to the Court's independent and legal responsibilities under Article III of the Constitution.\" - November 12 order denying motion to continue trial.\n\nJudge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly : \"The principal bases for [the defendant's] requested continuance are that President-elect Donald J. Trump has 'repeatedly stated that he would pardon' those involved in the January 6 riot and that 'a new Attorney General may dismiss' the case against him. The Court joins others in this District in rejecting Defendants' invitation to speculate about future clemency or charging decisions. \" - November 21 order denying motion to continue trial.\n\nChief Judge James Boasberg : \"Speculation as to what the incoming Administration may do is not a basis for a continuance.\" - December 2 order denying motion to postpone sentencing.\n\nRoyce Lamberth, a Reagan appointee, is the most outspoken judge when it comes to any downplaying of what happened on Jan. 6. In an April 2024 Wall Street Journal profile, the 80-year-old jurist was described as \"a leading voice pushing back against attempts by Republican politicians to play down the Jan. 6 attack.\" Lamberth said he decided to speak out, an unusual move for a federal judge presiding over cases for which he is obligated to remain impartial, because \"justifications for the Capitol attack\" represent an affront to \"the integrity of the judicial system.\"\n\nLamberth is sparing no harsh words in rejecting pleas for relief before Inauguration Day. Accusing J6ers of \"[subjecting] our Capitol and our country to the horrific scene of their anti-democratic rage,\" Lamberth refused to postpone the sentencing of Philip Sean Grillo, who was convicted of civil disorder and the common four misdemeanors. Any presidential pardon, Lamberth continued, would not undo the work of the courts and D.C. juries.\n\n\" To continue Mr. Grillo's sentencing now simply because he may receive a presidential pardon would discredit the time and thought these citizens expended on the trial and would subvert our criminal justice process and the separation of powers .\"\n\nOn December 6, Lamberth not only sentenced Grillo to 12 months in federal prison but took the unusual move of remanding him into immediate custody; judges usually allow a defendant to report two to three months following sentencing. Lamberth's decision appeared to make sure Grillo spent some time in jail before a presidential pardon spared him.\n\nIn a 13-page sentencing document explaining his reasons for imposing such a harsh move, Lamberth again criticized what he believes are attempts to \"minimize the events of January 6.\" Lamberth then erroneously claimed five police officers died as a result of the protest. \"One can only wonder what further horrors might have transpired if our elected officials had not gotten out in time. No matter what ultimately becomes of the Capital Riots cases already concluded and still pending, the true story of what happened on January 6, 2021 will never change.\"\n\nHe again took issue with Trump's plans to pardon J6ers and emphasized his independent role as a jurist. \"The fundamental American principle of separation of powers would be empty of meaning if the courts allowed themselves to become paralyzed based on conjecture about the coordinate branches' future actions. I will do my job, as I am bound by oath to do, and the President will do his; it is as simple as that.\"\n\nAnd at least one D.C. judge is taking direct aim at Trump for even considering pardons. Trump-appointee Carl Nichols, who presided over Steve Bannon's contempt case and sentenced the longtime Trump adviser to four months in a federal penitentiary, went so far as to say in a recent court hearing that it would be \"beyond frustrating and disappointing\" for the incoming president to issue \"blanket pardons ... or anything close.\"\n\nBut it's not just existing cases that are being fast-tracked before the transfer of power. Graves has announced the arrest of at least 10 Jan. 6 protesters since Election Day; last week, Graves charged at least three individuals for their participation in the Capitol protest.\n\nThere is no indication the DOJ will halt the pursuit of J6ers even as the pardon of Hunter Biden raises concerns over the practice of presidential pardons. Shortly after Joe Biden pardoned his son, Trump posted a message on Truth Social referring to the J6ers in what some consider a sign he is considering a similarly broad pardon. \"Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years? Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\" Trump wrote.\n\nIn apparent response, the New York Times editorial board criticized the Hunter Biden pardon not on its merits but because it makes it easier for \" Trump [to] pardon the perpetrators of the violent Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Julie Kelly: The Real Scandal Behind The Latest DOJ Defection\n\nAuthored by Julie Kelly via Declassified With Julie Kelly ,\n\nIn what has become the latest trend in #Resistance fashion, another government lawyer made a splashy exit from the Department of Justice this week. Denise Cheung, chief of the criminal division for the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington, sent a three-page letter to her boss explaining why she would have to quit rather than follow orders to pursue an investigation into potential wrongdoing tied to the Biden administration.\n\nIn noting her 24-year career at the DOJ-she once worked as former Attorney General Eric Holder's national security advisor-Cheung, like those before her, claimed the moral high ground as her excuse not to do her job. \" I have always worked to enforce the rule of law, to vindicate the rights of victims. and to protect the security of the nation, \" Cheung wrote to Ed Martin, the acting D.C. U.S. attorney and President Trump's pick to permanently run the powerful office, on February 18. \"I believe that the values the Department of Justice stands for, and the many people that work every day to fulfill them, are to be promoted and cherished.\"\n\nRecent antics by DOJ employees indicate one \"value\" is the ability to defy superiors with a change of the political winds. In Cheung's case , she challenged the veracity of evidence presented as the basis for a potential investigation into a Biden-era \"climate\" initiative with all the markings of a political slush fund ripe for fraud and corruption.\n\nThe so-called Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund first got attention when Lee Zeldin, the new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, laid out details of the jaw-dropping arrangement in a video posted last week. \"Roughly twenty billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA,\" Zeldin said on February 12. \"This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all the money in a rush job with reduced oversight.\"\n\nZeldin noted that the money, now understood to be \"parked\" at Citibank, was awarded to eight climate nonprofits who then \"doled out your money to NGOs and others at their discretion with far less transparency.\" He referred the matter to both the DOJ and EPA inspector general:\n\n🚨The Biden EPA tossed $20 billion of \"gold bars off the Titanic\". BIG UPDATE! We found the gold bars and they are now being recovered for you, the hardworking American taxpayer. Here are more of the details: pic.twitter.com/DM4C0TQcpj\n\nThere is no question about the political origins of the fund; the Biden White House touted the program with great fanfare months before the 2024 election. During a campaign stop last April, Kamala Harris announced the eight chosen winners of the $20 billion climate lottery. Harris also noted the unique nature of the arrangement, boasting that \"for the first time in history, we are providing tens of billions of dollars directly to community lenders to finance local climate projects. This is a novel approach, it is actually the first time we have taken this approach.\" (The list of recipients is here .)\n\nHere is Kamala Harris announcing the $20 billion climate lottery in April 2024. Lee Zeldin and Trump DOJ want an investigation into abuses of this fund-which is not overseen by Congress but by Citibank. First of its kind arrangement. I mean-what could go wrong? pic.twitter.com/JIfbLvMRuD\n\nAnd far from being a single-minded mission to reduce carbon emissions, the pot primarily is reserved for \"communities with environmental justice concerns, communities of color, low-income communities, rural communities, [and] Tribal communities.\" Projects could involve something as basic as replacing insulation and installing solar panels to buying a fleet of electric trucks to start a delivery service, Harris said in her speech.\n\nWhat possibly could go wrong?\n\nOne can only imagine how climate and social justice activists spending billions in free money with apparently no accountability might abuse the system. This is especially true of Joe Biden, who has a long history of leveraging his government power to enrich his family and friends . (Breaking news indicates one grantee is tied to Stacey Abrams. More on this in a follow up piece.)\n\nThe unusual nature of the arrangement alone-a major bank rather than Congress handling a big chunk of tax dollars with no known oversight mechanism established just a few months before the election-should raise the Spidey senses of any federal prosecutor, especially one with a stellar DOJ resume that stretches back more than two decades.\n\nBut not so with Cheung.\n\nApparently acting on information described by Zeldin, who is an attorney, and a separate video produced by Project Veritas that showed a Biden political appointee at the EPA admitting the administration was rushing to move the climate money before Trump got into office, acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove sought to initiate an investigation.\n\n\" I was asked to review documentation supplied by [Bove] to open a criminal investigation into whether a contract had been unlawfully awarded by an executive agency before the change in Administration and to issue grand jury subpoenas pursuant to this investigation, \" Cheung wrote in her resignation letter. \"I was told that there was time sensitivity and action had to be taken that day because there was concern that contract awardees could continue to draw down on accounts handled by the bank handling the disbursements.\"\n\nCheung said she then conferred with DOJ employees who have \"substantial white collar criminal prosecution experience.\" They concluded, however, \"the existing documents on their face did not seem to meet this threshold\" for an investigation.\n\nBove additionally sought a letter to Citibank ordering a \"freeze\" of funds related to the unidentified grant recipient. Cheung then contacted the famously corrupt Washington FBI field office for more guidance; she then concluded that enough evidence supported potential conspiracy and wire fraud charges.\n\nBut the letter from the FBI only \"recommended\" a freeze of the funds.\n\nWhen confronted by Martin, who wanted to send a follow-up letter demanding, not recommending, the freeze, Cheung refused. \"When I explained that the quantum of evidence did not support that action, you stated that you believed that there was sufficient evidence,\" she told Martin. \"I still do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to issue the letter you described, including sufficient evidence to tell the bank that there is probable cause to seize the particular accounts identified.\"\n\nShe then resigned per Martin's request.\n\nCheung's sanctimony and sudden devotion to careful prosecutorial scrutiny is hard to swallow given her history. After years of helping the DOJ pursue clearly politically motivated investigations against Republicans, Cheung suddenly suffered an alleged attack of conscience when it came to investigating Democrats?\n\nThis is, after all, the same Denise Cheung who was part of the DOJ team that initiated the dubious investigation into Donald Trump over Jan 6; brought federal charges against Trump advisors Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro for defying an illicit congressional committee; and helped manage the largest criminal prosecution in Justice Department history resulting in the arrest of nearly 1,600 Americans for the events of Jan 6.\n\nCheung's \"moral, ethical, and legal obligations,\" as she bragged in her resignation letter, never got in the way of her office's unlawful use of a post-Enron obstruction statute to turn hundreds of J6 protesters into lifelong felons. Or when her office applied federal misdemeanors such as \"parading\" in the Capitol for the first time against political protesters. Or when her office added terror enhancements to sentencing recommendations in order to throw nonviolent J6ers in federal prison for years. Or when her office sent women in their 70s to jail for protesting outside of abortion clinics.\n\nThe list of abuses by the DOJ tacitly endorsed by Cheung over the past decade or so is long and ignominious. Which is why her preachy indignation in the face of investigating Democrats rather than Republicans rings hollow.\n\nSubscribe to Declassified with Julie Kelly here...\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "First, They Came for the J6ers When a judicial system hell bent on destroying MAGA came for the J6ers, Congress said nothing.\n\nI received a text yesterday from House majority leader Steve Scalise, not exactly personal to be sure, but one whose message resonated. \"I am still fuming over the disgraceful Trump trial,\" said Scalise. So, of course, am I and every other thinking person, including Donald Trump who rightfully described himself as a \"political prisoner.\"\n\nBy the time they come for Congress, there will be no one left to say anything at all.\n\nIf, however, Scalise has fumed over the disgraceful prosecution of the 1,424 (and still counting) protestors arrested for being in or near the Capitol on January 6, 2021, he has done it quietly. Scalise is hardly an exception. When Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene pushed her colleagues to form a committee to investigate the treatment of the J6ers, she was met with indifference.\n\n\"We look into a lot of things that sometimes they may get to the next level of an investigation, and sometimes we just feel we don't feel like we've got enough to go to an investigation,\" said House Oversight chair James Comer in January 2023.\n\n\"A partisan judge oversaw a sham prosecution by a corrupt District Attorney for a bunch of made up crimes,\" Scalise texted me in regard to the Trump trial. But I have to ask, where were Scalise and his colleagues when hundreds of ordinary citizens endured trials in D.C. as corrupt as the one Trump endured in New York? The GOP silence surely emboldened White House operatives and led them to believe that Republicans might just roll over on Trump as well.\n\nI wrote my new book Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 to put a human face on the greatest mass injustice against American citizens since Japanese internment. In the book, I profile ten women who went to Washington on that fateful day and explain why they went and how they, too, became political prisoners. (READ MORE from Jack Cashill: The Surprisingly Shallow, Stupid World of Salman Rushdie )\n\nAlthough from a wide variety of backgrounds, these women shared a deeper commitment to freedom than the average citizen. They were also more aware of the corruption around them. To a person, they resisted the oppressive COVID regimes in their respective areas. Rather than submit to the airlines' absurd restrictions, nine of the 10 drove to Washington from states as distant as Colorado and Idaho. The only one who flew was Ashli Babbitt and then because San Diego was a bit too far of a drive.\n\nUnlike most Americans, these women knew all about the Russia collusion hoax that almost cost Trump the presidency in 2016 and did cost the Republicans the House in 2018. They knew how several states ignored the Constitution and loosened their voting laws without legislative approval. They saw how Biden operatives gathered up 51 intel officials to proclaim the Hunter Biden laptop a Russian hack and dump job. They watched in awe as the social media companies shut the laptop story down. And they stayed up past midnight on Election Day, only to see the counting stop and the vote count start shifting.\n\nKnowing the Constitution, these women came to Washington \"peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" They had much to protest and had no intention of doing anything more than protest.\n\nNone was armed. And yet of the 10, two were killed by police action - Ashli Babbitt and Roseanne Boyland - and the surviving eight were arrested. Six of those eight have been imprisoned, and two others await sentencing, one a great grandmother.\n\nMost, including Ashli Babbitt, entered through open doors or windows, wandered around sightseeing, shot some video, and stayed no more than 10 or 15 minutes. The worst offense any one of these women committed on January 6 was to help break a window.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment guaranteed the J6ers, as it did President Trump, the right \"to an impartial jury.\" In D.C., where these women were tried, only 5 percent of the citizens voted for the man the J6ers supported for president, Donald Trump. In Manhattan, where Trump was tried, the percentage wasn't much higher.\n\nI was able to attend the trial of Rebecca Lavrenz, a great grandmother from Colorado Springs. Lavrenz had walked in through an open Capitol door to pray and did just that, leaving 10 minutes after she arrived. Members of Congress had already evacuated the building by the time she entered.\n\nNot believing she had committed any crime, Lavrenz refused to plead guilty. After three years in limbo, Rebecca went to trial in late March 2024.  She was charged with the same four trumped-up misdemeanors as were many, perhaps most, of the 1400-plus protestors arrested on January 6: entering and remaining in a restricted building; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds; disorderly conduct in a capitol building; parading, demonstrating, or picketing in a capitol.\n\nEight of the 14 jurors, including two alternates, were white. Eight were female. As one of Rebecca's hard-boiled attorneys told me, \"The government strikes anyone who seems normal.\" The common denominator among them seemed to be boredom. When the prosecutors elicited from a squat, female Capitol Police officer that she feared for her life, the jurors looked non-plussed. Living in a city whose media are geared to please the 95 percent of its audience that voted against Donald Trump, they had heard it all before.\n\nThe two young prosecutors - both thin, white, and bespectacled - evoked Hannah Arendt's immortal phrase, \"the banality of evil.\" Arendt made that comment in reference to Nazi executioner-in-chief Adolph Eichmann. To be sure, the prosecutors had not ascended to that level of evil, but in their untroubled eagerness to send a prayerful great grandmother to prison they seemed capable. When badgered, Rebecca reiterated her firmly held belief, \"It was my First Amendment Right to be seen and heard. I wanted my presence to be known.\"\n\nToward the end of the fourth day of deliberation, the jurors delivered their verdict: guilty on all four counts. Rebecca received the news stoically. She thought the jurors might at least acquit her on the \"disorderly and disruptive conduct\" charge. That said, even before she left the courthouse that afternoon, Rebecca reasoned that the conviction was part of God's plan. She did not have to wait long for confirmation.\n\nWhen the apparatchiks who manage that system came for the J6ers, Congress said nothing. When they came for President Trump, it almost didn't matter what Congress said. By the time they come for Congress, there will be no one left to say anything at all.\n\nJack Cashill's new book, Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 , is available for purchase.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Why Republicans Should Make January 6 Their Issue The only way they can win this battle is to take the offensive. They've got the ammunition.\n\nL et's cut to the chase: The DOJ/FBI response to the events of January 6, 2021, represents the single greatest mass injustice against American citizens since Japanese internment. As I suggest in my new book, Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 , if the GOP does nut run towards this issue, they're fools.\n\nTo date, the GOP has been AWOL in the fight against this massive injustice.\n\nWhat makes the government's perverse overreaction easy to substantiate is that the Biden Department of Justice is still bragging about the body count: more than 1,424 defendants have been charged, 1,334 with entering or remaining in a restricted federal building, 355 with obstructing an official proceeding, 510 with assault, 133 with using a deadly or dangerous weapon, 57 with conspiracy. More than 500 protestors have been incarcerated. Some are still in the DC gulag awaiting trial. (READ MORE from Jack Cashill: Mammas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cops )\n\nGiven that Donald Trump netted only 5 percent of the DC vote in 2020, and that all change of venue requests were denied, the DOJ has a near perfect record in securing convictions in court or punitive plea deals. They brag about that too. They shouldn't. The Scottsboro Boys had a better chance of finding an unbiased jury in Jim Crow Alabama than the J6ers do in today's Washington DC.\n\nThe Scottsboro Boys at least had the ACLU on their side. No such luck for the J6ers. On the first anniversary, all fifty-one ACLU chapters signed on to the kind of letter the ACLU chapter of ancient Rome might have written about the Vandals or the Visigoths.\n\nThe ACLU propagandists wrote: \" On January 6 of last year, the residents of D.C. were traumatized as an insurrectionist mob roamed our streets, harassed our neighbors, and violently broke into the Capitol Building, killing at least five people - all in an attempt to overthrow the counting of American citizens ' votes.\"\n\nThe only thing the ACLU got right in this letter was the date. Of course, the J6ers killed no one. All the killing was done by the police, all the lying done by the Left. With the ACLU cheering the oppressors and the GOP cowed into silence, Biden's DOJ was free to inflict an unprecedented reign of terror on American citizens.\n\nThe case of Lisa Eisenhart and her son Eric Munchel is a testament to that terror. The DOJ knew precisely what the pair did not do. The reason is simple. Munchel wore an iPhone on his tactical vest and recorded non-stop the pair's patient 40-minute queue into the Capitol and their 11 minutes within.\n\nEisenhart wore a tactical vest as well. Wearing such vests was not illegal nor irrational. After a self-organized, self-declared \" Million MAGA March\" in Washington on November 14, 2020, leftist agitators openly attacked stragglers as they were walking to their hotels, knocking one man unconscious. Eisenhart and her son feared more of the same.\n\nWith Eisenhart in the lead, the two mounted the stairway to the Rotunda. The protestors milling about inside seemed excited to be there and, like Eisenhart and Munchel, confused about what to do next. As they wandered, Eisenhart grabbed a pile of zip ties sitting exposed on the side of a corridor. She claims she did not want them falling into the wrong hands. The behavior of her and her son makes the claim credible.\n\nFor a few minutes, the pair followed a group of rowdy young men whom Munchel repeatedly cautioned, \" Don ' t vandalize anything, we aren ' t Antifa,\" and then, more forcefully, \" You break shit. I break you.\" The viewer sees what Eisenhart saw, and that was a total absence of violence and vandalism. What the pair did not see or hear was the shooting death of Ashli Babbitt, which took place while they were in the vast building.\n\nLooking for an exit, Eisenhart and her son found their way to the gallery of the Senate chamber. There was little police presence in the chamber and none in the gallery. A photographer made Munchel infamous when he took a picture of him holding the zip ties. This photo earned him the media designation \" zip-tie guy\" and went viral quickly. On the following morning, he was contacted by the London Times .\n\nUnaware of any possible consequences, Eisenhart did the interview. \" If they ' re going to take every legitimate means from us, and we can ' t even express ourselves on the internet, we won ' t even be able to speak freely, what is America for?\" said Lisa defiantly. \"I ' d rather die as a 57-year-old woman than live under oppression.\" The DOJ took issue with this quote and included it in its charging document. Implied was that her stirring defense of free speech was seditious.\n\nJust two years earlier in that same Senate gallery, screaming women repeatedly interrupted an \" official proceeding,\" the Senate vote to confirm Bret Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. More than once, Vice President Pence had to stop the vote and call for order. Hundreds would be arrested during the DC protests, but no big deal. As NPR reported, \" Most of those charged this week with disorderly conduct, crowding or obstructing paid fines of $35 or $50.\"\n\nEisenhart and Munchel did not get off so easy. On the morning of January 8, a swarm of FBI agents descended on Munchel's home. His brother answered the door, only to be clapped in handcuffs while still in his underwear. At the time, the FBI did not know that Eisenhart was at the Capitol. It was she who would volunteer that information.\n\nMunchel was booked on January 9, Eisenhart on January 12, both at the federal courthouse in Nashville. \" I was floored when I read my charges,\" said Eisenhart. Having accused her of trying to overthrow the government, the feds deemed the 57-year-old nurse worthy of pre-trial detention. For the next eleven weeks, Lisa was shuttled among jails in Tennessee, Kentucky, and DC.\n\nLike other J6ers, Eisenhart was kept in maximum security. She spent those final six weeks in the notorious DC gulag - \"hungry, tired, and lonely.\" For clothing, the jailers gave her the equivalent of hospital scrubs. For warmth, they gave her a single thin blanket in a unit so cold in the morning she could see her breath. Before showers, they chained her hand and foot. Unable to sleep at night or eat food always served cold, Eisenhart lost 35 pounds and a goodly chunk of hair.\n\nIf Eisenhart had followed the case of attorney Urooj Rahman, she would have had some reason to be hopeful about her sentencing. During the George Floyd riots in May 2020, Rahman threw a Molotov cocktail through the window of an empty NYPD patrol car, setting it on fire. She was arrested and spent a few days in jail before being released to home confinement.\n\nIn November 2022, Federal judge Brian Cogan sentenced Rahman to 15 months in prison. \" You are a remarkable person who did a terrible thing on one night,\" Cogan told her. Praising her lifetime of work as a social justice warrior, he explained that hers was one of the most difficult sentences he ever had to impose.\n\nThe New York Times summarized their offense as follows, \" A Tennessee man and his mother were sentenced to prison on Friday for seeking to intimidate lawmakers by marching with matching tactical vests and carrying zip tie-style handcuffs.\" That ' s about it. Eisenhart got twice what Urooj Rahman got for firebombing a police car. Munchel got nearly twice that.\n\nLike hundreds of other January 6 defendants, Eisenhart and her son were charged with a felony for obstructing an official proceeding, a law spun out of the Enron debacle and creatively adapted to imprison J6ers. The Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of that adaptation before the end of June. In the interim, Eisenhart waits in Limbo. Munchel waits in prison.\n\nTo date, the GOP has been AWOL in the fight against this massive injustice. The Supreme Court ruling will force them to the front lines. The only way they can win this battle is to take the offensive. They've got the ammunition. They just need the will to use it.\n\nSome of this material has been adapted from Jack Cashill's new book, ASHLI: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6 , now available for purchase.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Trump Calls January 6 Hoopla a 'Political Hoax,' Says J6ers 'Have Served Horribly a Long Time'\n\nWednesday, during his first interview since becoming commander-in-chief, President Donald Trump discussed his decision to pardon those who had been charged in the January 6, 2021 protest/riot over alleged improprieties in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHost Sean Hannity acknowledged Trump campaigned on the pardon but asked why some who were \"violent with police\" were pardoned.\n\nAccording to Trump, many have already served for a long time.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nHANNITY: So, you did run on a platform. You were very straightforward. You said you would pardon these people that were sentenced for January 6.\n\nTRUMP: Yes, totally.\n\nHANNITY: You did. The only criticism or pushback I've seen is about people that were convicted or involved in incidents where they were violent with police. Why did they get a pardon?\n\nTRUMP: A number of reasons. Number one, they were in there for three and a half years, a long time. And in many solitary confinement, treated like nobody's ever been treated. Treated so badly. They were treated like the worst criminals in history. And you know what they were there for? They were protesting the vote because they knew the election was rigged and they were protesting the vote.\n\nAnd that, you know, should be allowed to protest a vote. You should be allowed to. You know, the day - when the day comes -\n\nHANNITY: But you shouldn't be able to invade the Capitol.\n\nTRUMP: Yes. Ready? Most of the people were absolutely innocent. OK. But forgetting all about that, these people have served horribly a long time. It would be very, very cumbersome to go and - look, you know, how many people are talking about? 1,500 people. Almost all of them are - should not have been - this should not have happened.\n\nAnd the other thing is this, some of those people with the police, true, but they were very minor incidents. OK. You know, they get built up by that a couple of fake guys that are on CNN all the time.\n\nHANNITY: Nobody watching it.\n\nTRUMP: They were very minor incidents. And it was time. You have murderers in Philadelphia. You have murderers in Los Angeles that don't even get any time. They don't even collect them and they know they're there to be collected. And then they go on television and act holier than thou about this one or that one.\n\nYou had 1,500 people that suffered. That's a lot of people. You know, they were looking for new people two weeks ago. They were looking - wait a minute, they were looking to charge new people. They have a woman who's 76 years old that they said was - made a statement that was a little bit out of line years after the fact.\n\nThis was a political hoax. And you know what, those people - and I'm not saying in every single case, but there was a lot of patriotism with those people, a lot of patriotism. You know, they did a recording and you know, I - they asked me if I do the voiceover and I did, do you know it was the number one selling whatever you call it nowadays, album, song -\n\nHANNITY: CD?\n\nTRUMP: - whatever you call it, you don't know it changes every year, right? But it was the number one selling song, number one on billboard, number one on everything, on everything for so long, people get it. They wanted to see those people.\n\nHANNITY: American people were - you told them what you would do.\n\nTRUMP: Well, they voted for me.\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on X @jeff_poor\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Judges want to set the record straightBy MICHAEL KUNZELMAN and ALANNA DURKIN RICHERAssociated PressThe Associated PressWASHINGTON\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - While sentencing a North Carolina man to prison for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot , a Republican-appointed judge issued a stark warning: Efforts to portray the mob of Donald Trump's supporters as heroes and play down the violence that unfolded on Jan. 6, 2021 , pose a serious threat to the nation.\n\nU.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth condemned the depiction by Trump and Republican allies of Jan. 6 defendants as \"political prisoners\" and \"hostages.\" Lamberth also denounced attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the justice system for punishing rioters who broke the law when they invaded the Capitol.\n\n\"In my 37 years on the bench, I cannot recall a time when such meritless justifications of criminal activity have gone mainstream,\" Lamberth, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, wrote in a recent ruling . The judge added he \"fears that such destructive, misguided rhetoric could presage further danger to our country.\"\n\nAs Trump floats potential pardons for rioters if he returns to the White House, judges overseeing the more than 1,200 Jan. 6 criminal cases in Washington's federal court are using their platform to try to set the record straight concerning distortions about an attack that was broadcast live on television. A growing number of defendants appear to be embracing rhetoric spread by Trump, giving defiant speeches in court, repeating his false election claims and portraying themselves as patriots.\n\nDuring a recent court hearing, Proud Boys member Marc Bru repeatedly insulted and interrupted the judge, who ultimately sentenced him to six years in prison. \"You can give me 100 years and I'd do it all over again,\" Bru said.\n\nAt least two other rioters shouted \"Trump won!\" in court after receiving their punishment.\n\nSome people charged in the riot are pinning their hopes on a Trump victory in November.\n\nRachel Marie Powell, a Pennsylvania woman who was sentenced to nearly five years in prison for smashing a Capitol window, told a CNN reporter that the 2024 presidential election is \"like life or death\" for her. She said she believes she will get out of prison if Trump is elected.\n\nThe rhetoric resonates with the strangers who donate money to Jan. 6 defendant's online campaigns, but it isn't earning them any sympathy from the judges. Judges appointed by presidents from both political parties have described the riot as an affront to democracy and they repeatedly have admonished defendants for not showing true remorse or casting themselves as victims.\n\nOver more than three years, judges have watched hours of video showing members of the mob violently shoving past overwhelmed officers, shattering windows, attacking police with things such as flagpoles and pepper spray and threatening violence against lawmakers. In court hearings, officers have described being beaten, threatened and scared for their lives as they tried to defend the Capitol.\n\nBefore sentencing a Kentucky man, who already had a long criminal record, to 14 years in prison for attacking police with pepper spray and a chair, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta admonished the man for propagating \"the lie that what's happening here in Washington, D.C., is unfair and unjust.\"\n\n\"You are not a political prisoner,\" Mehta, who was nominated by President Barack Obama told Peter Schwartz. \"You're not Alexei Navalny,\" the judge said referring to the imprisoned Russian opposition leader. \"You're not somebody who is standing up against injustice, who's fighting against an autocratic regime. ... You're somebody who decided to take the day into his own hands, much in the same way that you have used your hands against others for much of your life.\"\n\nLamberth's scathing remarks came in the case of James Little, a North Carolina man who was not accused of any violence or destruction during the riot and pleaded guilty only to a misdemeanor offense. Lamberth didn't name the people responsible for what the judge called \"shameless\" attempts to rewrite history. But Trump has closely aligned himself with rioters during his presidential campaign. He has described them as \"hostages,\" called for their release from jail and pledged to pardon a large portion of them if he wins the White House in November.\n\nRoughly 750 people charged with federal crimes in the riot have pleaded guilty and more than 100 others have been convicted at trial. Many rioters were charged only with misdemeanor offenses akin to trespassing while others face serious felonies such as assault or seditious conspiracy. Of those who have been sentenced, roughly two-thirds have received some time behind bars, with terms ranging from a few days of intermittent confinement to 22 years in prison, according to data compiled by The Associated Press .\n\nLamberth had originally sentenced Little in 2022 to 60 days behind bars, followed by three years of probation. But Washington's federal appeals court sided with Little on appeal, ruling he could not be sentenced to both prison time and probation. When Little's case returned to Lamberth's court, the judge resentenced him to 150 days - with credit for time already served in jail and on probation - citing the man's claims of persecution and efforts to downplay the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"Little cannot bring himself to admit that he did the wrong thing, although he came close today,\" Judge Lamberth wrote. \"So it is up to the court to tell the public the truth: Mr. Little's actions, and the actions of others who broke the law on Jan. 6, were wrong. The court does not expect its remarks to fully stem the tide of falsehoods. But I hope a little truth will go a long way.\"\n\nAn attorney for Little declined to comment on Lamberth's remarks.\n\nIn other cases, judges have said their sentence must send a message when rioters have promoted the notion that they are being unfairly prosecuted for their political views. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper told Richard \"Bigo\" Barnett, the Arkansas man who propped his feet on a desk in then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office in a widely circulated photo, that he seemed to enjoy the notoriety of becoming one of the faces of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"You have made yourself one of the faces of J6 not just through that photo but using your platform and your notoriety to peddle the misconception that you and other J6ers are somehow political prisoners who are being persecuted for your beliefs as opposed to your conduct on Jan. 6,\" Cooper, an Obama appointee, told Barnett before sentencing him to more than four years in prison.\n\n\"So to all those folks that follow Bigo, they need to know that the actions of Jan. 6 cannot be repeated without some serious repercussions,\" the judge said.\n\n____\n\nRicher reported from Boston.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Jim Clyburn Expresses Support For Trump Pardoning J6ers On 'Case-By-Case Basis'\n\nScreenshot/Rumble/CNN\n\nDemocratic South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn suggested Monday that he could support President-elect Donald Trump pardoning certain Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot participants.\n\nDuring a Sunday interview on \"Meet the Press,\" Trump stated he intends to pardon the protesters on the first day of his second presidential term. Clyburn , on \"CNN News Central,\" condemned Trump's actions surrounding the riot and the conduct of some protesters, but acknowledged that pardons might be warranted for individuals who \"got caught up\" due to \"emotions.\" (RELATED: Andy McCarthy Says Hunter Biden Was Pardoned On Charges That 'No American' Would A Catch A Break On)\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I think that it's the president's prerogative to pardon whomever he wishes to pardon. That's up to the president,\" Clyburn said. \"I favor the pardon system ... It ought to be used to forgive and to provide a second chance. So if you go a case-by-case basis, you look at all of those people, some people may have gotten caught up in the emotions and maybe a pardon for them would be okay.\"\n\n\"But if you're using the American flag, plunging it at the enforcement officers, you have injured a law enforcement officer and you're spraying whatever the stuff was they were spraying on people, those people should not be pardoned,\" he continued. \"And so yes, go case-by-case and then maybe some people got caught up and give them a pardon, but a blanket pardon to everybody irrespective, no, I do not agree with that.\"\n\nCNN presidential historian Tim Naftali recently asserted that President Joe Biden's pardon of his son Hunter \"helps justify\" Trump's anticipated pardon of the Jan. 6 protesters.\n\n\"I fear that though President-elect Trump didn't need an excuse to engage in wide-scale pardoning, for example, of the January 6th - those that have [been] convicted for crimes on January 6th or as a result of January 6th - this just I think helps justify it for President-elect Trump,\" he said.\n\nTrump repeatedly pledged to pardon the Jan. 6 protesters during his 2024 presidential campaign. He said during a May 2023 CNN town hall that he would pardon a \"large portion\" of them \"very early on\" in his second administration.\n\n\"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one because a couple of them probably they got out of control, but, you know, when you look at Antifa, what they've done to Portland, and if you look at Antifa, look at what they've done to Minneapolis and so many other - so many other places, look at what they did to Seattle,\" Trump said at the time. \"And BLM - BLM, many people were killed.\"\n\n\"These people - I'm not trying to justify anything, but you have two standards of justice of this country, and ... what they've done to so many people is nothing - nothing,\" he added. \"And then what they've done to these people - they've persecuted these people.\"\n\nOver 1,500 defendants have faced charges for their involvement in the riot as of October, according to the Department of Justice. Over 1,000 have already faced sentencing, including 645 who have received jail time and 143 receiving home confinement.\n\nClyburn also revealed on Thursday that he has urged Biden's staff to push the president to issue a \"preemptive\" pardon for Trump.\n\n\"I have not urged the president directly, but I did have that discussion with the members of his staff that I thought he ought to do that,\" Clyburn said. \"I think we need to clear the air in this country ... I think that we are trying to run a government on behalf of all the people of this country, and if we spend all of our time going forward pursuing Trump or Trump pursuing [Former Wyoming Republican Rep.] Liz Cheney, [special counsel] Jack Smith, Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, that is what we need to get off the table.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Jim Clyburn Expresses Support For Trump Pardoning J6ers On 'Case-By-Case Basis')\n\nOf those more than two dozen informants, four entered the Capitol during the riot and 13 others crossed a security perimeter to enter Capitol complex grounds, according to the report.\n\nThe Justice Department IG's findings were previously unknown. FBI Director Christopher Wray has consistently refused to tell lawmakers if the Bureau had informants or undercover agents in the Capitol during the January 6th riot.\n\nIn July, FBI Director Chris Wray DODGED a question about confidential human sources at the Capitol on January 6th.\n\nNow we know why... https://t.co/OWfiGvqvCz pic.twitter.com/EqmmsgA7p3\n\n- Kingsley Wilson (@KingsleyCortes) December 12, 2024\n\n\"I'm never going to be getting into when or where or have not used confidential human sources,\" Wray told Republican Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in July in response to her question on whether the FBI had informants in the Capitol on January 6th.\n\nDespite appearing to have committed some of the same offenses of people who participated in the January 6th riot and have been prosecuted by the DOJ, none of the FBI's informants who entered the U.S. Capitol complex have been charged, according to the report. Nearly 1500 Americans have been prosecuted by the Biden DOJ in connection to January 6th-related incidents.\n\n\"None of these FBI confidential human sources (CHS) were authorized to enter the Capitol or a restricted area, or to otherwise break the law on January 6, nor was any CHS directed by the FBI to encourage others to commit illegal acts on January 6,\" the DOJ's investigator general wrote.\n\nThere is no evidence that any of the Bureau's undercover agents entered the Capitol during the riot, according to the report.\n\nIt is unclear whether members of the House Select Committee on the January 6th attack were previously aware of the report's findings. Democratic Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, chair of the January 6th Committee, and Democratic California Sen.

      "text": "Biden DOJ Tries To Salvage Jan 6. Charges After Facing Major Blow At Supreme Court\n\n(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) is taking steps to preserve charges against Jan. 6 defendants after the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to their efforts.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court issued a ruling June 28 limiting the scope of an obstruction statute used to charge hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the DOJ would \"continue to use all available tools to hold accountable those criminally responsible for the January 6 attack on our democracy.\" Since then, the DOJ has taken first steps to salvage its charges, including asking judges for additional time to evaluate the impact of the ruling while stressing that the Supreme Court did not entirely reject its use of the statute.\n\nThe statute, Section 1512(c)(2), holds up to 20 years in prison for anyone who \"obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding.\" However, the Supreme Court held in Fischer v. United States that to charge an individual under the law, \"the Government must establish that the defendant impaired the availability or integrity for use in an official proceeding of records, documents, objects, or as we earlier explained, other things used in the proceeding, or attempted to do so.\"\n\nOver 355 Jan. 6 defendants have been charged with \"corruptly obstructing, influencing, or impeding an official proceeding,\" according to the DOJ. (RELATED: Supreme Court Thoroughly Rebukes Biden DOJ For Abusing Law To Go After Trump And His Supporters)\n\n\"The DOJ is not happy about the Fischer decision and is currently strategizing ways to circumvent the Supreme Court's ruling,\" criminal defense attorney David W. Fischer wrote Wednesday for Declassified with Julie Kelly. \"For example, in certain cases the DOJ may attempt to recharge using corrected charging language in indictments, which will claim that particular defendants targeted the ceremonial ballot box or other documents used by Congress during the January 6 certification. Creative charging language, however, doesn't change the evidence, which is quite strong that none of the J6ers were targeting evidence.\"\n\nIn a number of cases, the DOJ is now asking for additional time to evaluate how the ruling will apply.\n\n\"The Supreme Court remanded Fischer to the D.C. Circuit for further proceedings and to assess the sufficiency of the indictment on that count,\" U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves wrote Thursday in defendant Taylor Franklin Taranto's case. \"Based on the Supreme Court's opinion and the forthcoming proceedings in the D.C. Circuit, the government anticipates that it will need additional time to evaluate its prosecution of charges under 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(2).\"\n\nGraves' office wrote Tuesday in defendant Tara Stottlemyer's case that her conduct \"may very well meet the changed standard\" for the statute, noting that the \"government is still evaluating Fischer's impact on this and other January 6 cases.\"\n\nProsecutors cited Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's concurring opinion, which noted that it \"it might well be that Fischer's conduct, as alleged here, involved the impairment (or the attempted impairment) of the availability or integrity of things used during the January 6 proceeding.\"\n\n\"If so, then Fischer's prosecution under §1512(c)(2) can, and should, proceed,\" Jackson wrote .\n\nJackson joined the majority in the case to limit the statute's scope, while Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote the dissent, which was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\n\nCriminal defense attorney William Shipley, who represents Stottlemyer, wrote on X that the DOJ's efforts to delay are \"very frustrating for Tara and other J6 defendants who rightfully see Fischer as a victory that is now being withheld from them by procedural games.\"\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - MARCH 20: Morning light shines outside The United States Supreme Court building on March 20, 2017 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images)\n\nHowever, some defendants have already seen relief. Judges granted several defendants, including Kevin Seefried , Alexander Sheppard and Thomas B. Adams Jr., early release before the Supreme Court even issued its ruling.\n\nThe DOJ stated Wednesday in a filing it would not yet request Adams Jr.'s return to custody.\n\nA federal judge also granted defendant Jorge Riley release on Friday pending the resolution of his motion to vacate his sentence. The DOJ did not oppose Riley's request, though it declined to concede he had a \"meritorious claim\" under the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\n\"In short, the United States' decision to not oppose Riley's motion for release should in no way be understood as a waiver or concession regarding the merits of Riley's Section 2255 claims, collateral attacks based on Fischer generally, or any other January 6 case that may (or may not) be impacted by Fischer,\" Graves wrote Thursday.\n\nLikewise, the DOJ did not oppose defendant Katharine Morrison's motion to terminate her special condition of home detention on Wednesday but emphasized it should not be \"construed as a concession\" that she has a claim under Fischer .\n\nProsecutors requested dismissal of the obstruction count Friday in defendant Mark Sahady's case to enable the trial to proceed in August on other counts and to \"promote judicial economy and efficiency.\"\n\n\"The vast majority of the more than 1,400 defendants charged for their illegal actions on January 6 will not be affected by this decision,\" Garland noted in his statement after the Supreme Court's ruling. \"There are no cases in which the Department charged a January 6 defendant only with the offense at issue in Fischer.\"\n\nThe DOJ did not respond to the DCNF's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "'QAnon Shaman' Plans Big Purchase After Pardon From Trump\n\nPhoto by Brent Stirton/Getty Images\n\nYou probably don't know Jacob Chansley by name, but you certainly know the guy who walked into the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a fur-trimmed Viking helmet and face paint.\n\nDerisively dubbed the \" QAnon Shaman \" by hostile media, the name nevertheless stuck. But Chansley certainly doesn't seem to care, now that he's been issued a pardon by President Donald Trump and released from his prison sentence that nearly three and a half years. All he wants to do is, \"BUY SOME MOTHA FU*KIN GUNS.\"\n\nI JUST GOT THE NEWS FROM MY LAWYER... I GOT A PARDON BABY! THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!\n\nNOW I AM GONNA BUY SOME MOTHA FU*KIN GUNS!!! I LOVE THIS COUNTRY!!! GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!! J6ers are getting released & JUSTICE HAS COME... EVERYTHING done in the dark WILL come to light! pic.twitter.com/g9pwc7v9EQ\n\n- Jake Angeli-Chansley (@AmericaShaman) January 21, 2025\n\nHe brought Jan. 6 enthusiasm to X, thanking President Trump and declaring his love of the country. While felons aren't typically allowed to own firearms, Trump's pardon (rather than commutation) means Chansley is in good legal standing to once again bear arms. Go to that gun show, my guy; go wild. (RELATED: Sign up for Daily Caller Newsletter, 'Cultured')\n\nThis is everything libs fear most, two neuroses in one: fear of inanimate guns and revulsion toward rabble-rousing populists. But for all their talk of \" restorative justice \" and \" abolishing prisons ,\" their empathy only seems to extend to likely recidivists.\n\nThe violent career criminal who's been arrested and released dozens of times because progressive DAs won't press charges is sure to re-offend and make life miserable (and dangerous) for regular people. Yet libs are perfectly happy to watch that wagon go round and round. Meanwhile, good luck finding a New York Times reader who believes the QAnon Shaman deserves a second chance.\n\nBut does anyone really believe he's going to something illegal, let alone violent, again? He seems like a far safer bet than libs usually gamble on; this seems to be a man who truly loves his country and is just happy to be free. After years of legal trauma, the Shaman is likely hanging up his hat - and staying far away from the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "JASON LEWIS: Radical Democrats Regard The Bill Of Rights As A Nuisance\n\n(Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images)\n\nOf all the left-wing attacks on the rule of law, the most dangerous is the deliberate attack on the Supreme Court of the United States. It is, of course, a \"threat to democracy\" as high-court justices are nominated by an elected president and confirmed by elected senators. But more troubling, it is a direct assault on the republic itself because lifetime appointments to the bench were designed to counter the mob.\n\nWhich is precisely what the unhinged left has become.\n\nAt some point, however, the Democrat hypocrisy must be evident to the average voter. Republicans advisers are jailed for contempt of an illegitimate J6 committee while Merrick Garland scoffs at Congress by refusing to turn over the rambling audio of President Joe Biden's interview with a special counsel - made all the more egregious by the faltering president's debate performance.\n\nThis same attorney general who has presided over a clearly weaponized Department of Justice using a white-collar Enron-era statute to prosecute J6ers. That is, until the high court said enough . Once again, the same Democrat partisans lecture former President Donald Trump about respecting a runaway state court in New York while savaging sitting justices on the Supreme Court. (RELATED: JASON LEWIS: Left-Wing Reprobates Continue To Unleash Vitriol Against Supreme Court)\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they have no \"limiting principles\" that might constrain their insatiable desire to get the outcome they want from every single legal decision.\n\nIt matters little to them that no serious observer would confuse Chief Justice John Roberts with Robert Bork. Indeed, the high court has hardly trail-blazed a path toward strict constructionism. Roberts has put his finger to the wind too many times to mention and Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch have both showed signs of their inner Anthony Kennedy.\n\nBut even flirting with originalism is taboo to the anarchist mob. And that explains the hysteria from the Democrat/Media complex over the just completed term which at least kept the Republic hanging on by a thread.\n\nObviously, Democrats are irate in their failure to use the courts to prosecute Trump. The justices quickly saw through the dangerous schemes, ruling 9-0 that conflating Donald J. Trump with Robert E. Lee to keep the former president off the ballot was, well... a threat to democracy.\n\nAs mentioned, a 6-3 majority down attempts to charge J6 protestors with violating the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a 2002 law that prohibited financial \"evidence tampering.\"\n\nBut the coup de grace was the SCOTUS immunity ruling that, ironically enough, might just benefit Biden more than anyone. History was never on the side of Garland's witch-hunt for myriad reasons that had less to do with Trump and more with everyone who might succeed him. No president could conduct the \"official\" affairs of office if everything they say or do is subject to criminal prosecution by a weaponized DOJ.\n\nThe high court's good week did not end with all things Trump. Finally, after years of nibbling around the edges of an out-of-control administrative state, the justices found in favor of congressional intent and trial by jury in two landmark cases.\n\nIt overturned the Chevron doctrine giving undue deference to federal agencies in interpreting ambiguities in the law. After years of watching \"wetland\" and \"endangered species\" regulations trample property rights, SCOTUS reasserted the constitutional duty of Congress to write the law - not delegate it to unelected bureaucrats - and the judiciary to settle disputes accordingly.\n\nIt also ruled, in a separate case, that the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot conduct its own \"trials\" and enforce penalties without the judicial imprimatur of due process. It is not surprising that those going after Trump are the most upset with the decision.\n\nAs they were with another that properly put on hold an EPA pollution rule circumventing state prerogative through provisions in the Clean Air Act that may not have authorized such sweeping federal power. A logical conclusion on the heels of West Virginia vs. EPA where SCOTUS had previously struck down the Obama-Biden Clean Power Plan due to its lack of \"clear congressional authorization.\"\n\nSomething the inimitable Justice Clarence Thomas said was evident in a different case. Writing for the majority, Thomas explained that not only had the National Firearms Act of 1934 clearly defined a \"machine gun\" as \"any weapon which shoots...automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger,\" but that the ATF \"consistently took the position that semiautomatic rifles equipped with bump stocks were not machine guns under\" the law.\n\nThis, no doubt, was salt in the wound of liberal activists who still haven't forgiven Thomas for his opinion in Bruen finding that the Second Amendment isn't a \"constitutional orphan\" after all. But it did not stop his \"originalist\" colleagues from concluding that a domestic abuser \"found to pose a credible threat\" could be disarmed prior to a conviction.\n\nWhy, SCOTUS even denied standing to a pro-life attempt at having the Food and Drug Administration re-regulate the abortion pill, mifepristone. You would have thought this might earn a few liberal cheers. Nope, the court-packers were too busy howling over a long-overdue decision slapping down the silly Ninth Circuit ruling that cleaning up the streets amounts to \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" (RELATED: JASON LEWIS: The 'Deep State' Is Far Deeper Than Anyone Imagined)\n\nReally. Municipalities can't put an end to the public drug dealing and defecation in homeless \"tent cities\" that clearly \"pose a credible threat\" to the community? Well, now they can.\n\nBut as I've noted before , the critics' hypocrisy knows no bounds.\n\nYet, all was not lost for radical Democrats who regard the Bill of Rights as a greater nuisance than a filthy homeless encampment. In the high court's worst decision of the term, written by Barrett, the majority found that White House coordination with social media companies in order to censor COVID \"misinformation\" (much of which turned out to be more accurate than what the government was saying) failed to show harm to the plaintiffs.\n\nYeah, right...just everyone else.\n\nNevertheless, the relentless drumbeat against Justices Kavanaugh, Alito and Thomas continues unabated. Partial victories, compromise and the give and take of a constitutional republic just won't do. The mob wants it all.\n\nFormer Congressman Jason Lewis is the author of \"Party Animal, The Truth About President Trump, Power Politics and the Partisan Press.\" This article was originally published on the author's Substack page, which can be viewed here .

We have a fight on our \n\t\t\t\t\thands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.\n\nWe're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. \n\t\t\t\t\tOur original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates \n\t\t\t\t\tthem -- because we won't bend the knee to political correctness.\n\nOne reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of \n\t\t\t\t\tour being, and we think she's worth saving from today's craziness.\n\nHelp us save her.\n\nA second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train.  We have \n\t\t\t\t\ttrained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political \n\t\t\t\t\tspectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There's a good chance they were trained at Daily \n\t\t\t\t\tCaller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, \n\t\t\t\t\tNewsmax, Daily Wire and many others.\n\nSimply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a \n\t\t\t\t\tfair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.\n\nSince 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnd we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible \n\t\t\t\t\tto ignore.\n\nWe can overcome the forces lined up against all of us.

No?\" Greene continued to push. \"I haven't -,\" the reporter replied.\n\nTo much controversy, former President Joe Biden pardoned five members of his family with only minutes left of his time in office.\n\n\"Okay, what about the rapers [sic], killers, and murders that Joe Biden pardoned - there are tons of them - is that a focus at all?\" Greene once again asked, only to receive a response that the reporter was focused on the J6 issue.\n\nIn late December, Biden commuted the death sentences of dozens of convicted killers, including a man who murdered a police officer and a man who kidnapped and murdered a 12-year-old girl.\n\n\"I know what you're asking about - I'm not doing this,\" Greene told the reporter. \"This insane place up here, and all of y'all's obsession with January 6 is absurd. Everybody outside of here is sick and f***ing tired of it. I'm serious.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden pardoned all these murderers and rapists and disgusting people, and then everybody up here has got their panties in a wad because J6ers got pardoned,\" the lawmaker continued. \"A lot of them walked through open doors.

      "text": "DeSantis Indicates He's Willing To Potentially Pardon Trump, J6ers Early In First Term\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis said during an interview this week that he was willing to pardon former President Donald Trump if the facts of the case showed that he was the victim of political weaponization.\n\nDeSantis made the remarks during an interview on \"The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show\" on Thursday, saying that he will assemble a team on day one of his administration that reviews cases that potentially should be pardoned.\n\nThe remarks come as the former president faces two federal criminal investigations, including an investigation into his handling of classified government materials and an investigation into his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Do you think the January 6 defendants deserve to have their cases examined by a Republican president?\" Travis asked. \"And if Trump, let's say, gets charged with federal offenses and you are the President of the United States, would you look at potentially pardoning Trump himself based on the evidence that might emerge of those charges?\"\n\n\"The DOJ and FBI have been weaponized. We see that. We see it in a variety of contexts, some of which you mentioned,\" he said. \"Some of it is the FBI going after parents going to school board meeting. Some of it's how they treat a pro-life demonstrator, how they don't go after people that are attacking pro-lifers. And so what I'm going to do is - I'm going to do on day one - I will have folks that will get together and look at all these cases, who are people who are victims of weaponization or political targeting, and we will be aggressive at issuing pardons. Now, some of these cases, some people may have a technical violation of the law.\"\n\nDeSantis also said that he would look to issue the pardons during the early days of his administration, not toward the end as most administrations do.\n\n\"But if there are three other people who did the same thing, but just in a context like BLM and they don't get prosecuted at all, that is uneven application of justice, and so we're going to find ways where that did not happen,\" he said. \"And then we will use the pardon power - and I will do that at the front end. You know, a lot of people wait until the end of the administration to issue pardons. We're going to find examples where government's been weaponized against disfavored groups, and we will apply relief as appropriate. But it will be done on a case-by-case basis, because I think you've got to make sure that ... there's a whole bunch of cases that don't necessarily get headlines. But if people are being treated just because they don't get on TV or something, they're being treated disfavorably. They need to have a fair hearing as well.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would consider even pardoning Trump, DeSantis said, \"I would say any example of disfavored treatment based on politics or weaponization would be included in that review, no matter how small or how big.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "J6 Attorney Rebuffs Argument That Some J6 Defendants Shouldn't Have Been Pardoned\n\n\"The Biden Justice Department has themselves to blame...\"\n\nWilliam Shipley, an attorney representing dozens of J6 defendants, including the so-called Qanon Shaman , told The Daily Wire this week that President Donald Trump's sweeping action for J6 defendants, even for those accused of violence, was necessary due to the Biden DOJ's refusal to give the accused fair trials.\n\nTrump's executive order , which was signed just hours after Trump was sworn into office, g ranted full pardons for every person convicted in relation to J6, with the exception of 14 commutations. The EO also ordered dismissals for the hundreds of cases awaiting trial or sentencing.\n\n\" I have said this publicly, I have filed this argument, I have argued it in court to multiple judges: t he reality is that January 6 defendants could not receive a fair trial in the District of Columbia given the juror pool,\" Shipley told The Daily Wire.\n\n\"The government never moved off of that position, and demanded that the cases go forward in the District of Columbia, knowing that to be true, which is reflected by the fact that so many defendants opted for bench trials to avoid the D.C. jurors,\" the attorney continued. \" I mean, that speaks volumes.\"\n\nJ6 defendants \"could not get their 5th and 6th Amendment rights to a fair trial in the District of Columbia,\" which \" justifies the pardons,\" Shipley said. \"The Biden Justice Department has themselves to blame for that fact.\"\n\nCELEBRATE #47 WITH 47% OFF DAILYWIRE+ MEMBERSHIPS + A FREE $20 GIFT\n\nOn Monday evening, Trump reasoned that the J6 defendants accused of violence have already done their time.\n\n\"I will say this, they've been in jail for a long time already,\" the president told the press. \"I see murderers in this country get two years, one year, and maybe no time. So they've already been in jail for a long time. These people have been destroyed, what they've done to these people is outrageous.\"\n\nShipley noted former President Joe Biden's last-minute pardons for his family members and the dozens of controversial commutations for violent death row inmates in context with Trump's sweeping J6 pardons.\n\n\"I think after the Biden administration did what they did with just the massive pardons on their way out the door - I don't know that that had any actual influence on what the Trump administration decided to do, but I don't think anybody was really anticipating a sweeping set of pardons and commutations of sentences to time served across the board, resulting in the release of everybody.\"\n\nThe attorney told The Daily Wire that there were 211 J6ers in custody at the time Trump's executive order was signed. They are all now out of custody, despite some delays.\n\nWhen Shipley was contacted by his clients' family about delays, he said he was able to get in touch with Trump administration officials who helped to quickly secure releases. However, that was not the case in Washington D.C., where the longest delays took place.\n\n\"Now there is the problem in D.C. that has persisted until just the last hour or so where the District of Columbia Department of Corrections, which is not part of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, they did not respond in the same way and they just said, 'Well, we'll do it tomorrow,'\" Shipley said on Tuesday.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Two more Proud Boy activists were sentenced to a combined 28 years on Friday. Ethan Nordean, the leader of a Seattle chapter, was given an 18-year sentence, and Dominic Pezzola was sentenced to 10 years.\n\nThe latest sentence came down on Tuesday for Proud Boy Chairman Enrique Tarrio who the judge gave 22 years.\n\nFederal prosecutors used terrorist enhancements to extend the convicts' sentences over a riot where the only fatal victims were pro-Trump demonstrators. Biggs' 17-year stay was enhanced over the defendant's destruction of a fence on Capitol grounds.\n\nJudge Kelly justified the lengthy prison terms during his court address to Nordean and Pezzola by declaring the Capitol riot a \"national disgrace.\"\n\nThe decades-long prison sentences, however, represent a radical departure from how domestic terrorists were treated after far-left revolutionaries catalyzed the most destructive explosion of civil unrest in decades. The riots for social justice that became routine throughout 2020 cost more than 66 times the inflated estimates of the Capitol carnage. That's just accounting for the two-week aftermath of the riots over George Floyd's death alone.\n\nResidents in Kenosha, Wisconsin, were still recovering last year from the devastation of the 2020 riots stemming from a police shooting of an armed 29-year-old black man.\n\nFar-left demonstrators went largely unpunished for the carnage that wrecked mainstreets across the nation throughout the presidential election year while Democrats and the corporate press downplayed the damage.\n\nFormer Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, who enabled the complete takeover of a city neighborhood to become known as Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), labeled the turbulent \"summer of love.\" CNN made a mockery of the network when the channel covered the Kenosha riots as \" mostly peaceful \" while a car lot burned in the background. Vice President Kamala Harris even encouraged followers to deliver bail money to those arrested for crimes related to the Minneapolis riots. As it turns out, many of the defendants Harris encouraged people to bail out were repeat offenders with violent histories.\n\n[RELATED: 28 Times Media And Democrats Excused Or Endorsed Violence Committed By Left-Wing Activists ]\n\nThe sentences eventually handed down over the eruption of far-left terrorism paled in comparison to the decades in prison given to Jan. 6 demonstrators. A Minnesota man, for example, was sentenced to just four years for lighting the Minneapolis police station on fire.\n\nWhile standing in front of the burning police headquarters, MSNBC's Ali Velshi tried to sell the riots around him as not \"generally speaking, unruly.\"\n\n\"This mostly a protest. It is not, generally speaking, unruly. But fires have been started.\" MSNBC reporter says protests in Minneapolis are not \"generally speaking, unruly\" as buildings burn in the background. pic.twitter.com/IzzEmKgxhM\n\nIn January, a federal judge sentenced a pair of disbarred attorneys to just more than a year in prison for setting ablaze a New York City police car with a Molotov cocktail. While prosecutors similarly used terrorist enhancements to recommend longer prison sentences, the requested term was only for 18-24 months for ex-lawyer Colinford Mattis in contrast to the decades sought for Jan. 6 defendants.\n\nGiven the contrast between Jan. 6 prisoners and left-wing anarchists, it should come as no surprise that the most vitriolic of the D.C. judges to preside over Capitol riot defendants is also assigned to former President Donald Trump's Jan. 6 case.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan has overseen more than three dozen cases of individuals charged with crimes over the Jan. 6 riot. According to the Associated Press, Chutkan often issued sentences that went far beyond prosecutors' recommendations.\n\n\"Other judges typically have handed down sentences that are more lenient than those requested by prosecutors,\" the AP reported. \"Chutkan, however, has matched or exceeded prosecutors' recommendations in 19 of her 38 sentences. In four of those cases, prosecutors weren't seeking any jail time at all.\"\n\nTrump is now expected to face trial during the presidential contest next year presided by a judge in a district where the jury pool voted for President Joe Biden 92 to 5 percent.\n\n[READ: Judge Tanya Chutkan's Record Should Disqualify Her From Presiding Over Trump's J6 Trial ]\n\nA poll from last year found that 4 in 5 Americans believe there is a two-tiered system of justice.

      "text": "This Activist Wife Schmoozes The Get-Trump White House While Her Prosecutor Husband Jails J6ers\n\nThe political nature of the Jan. 6 prosecutions is illustrated by the partisan history of Matthew Graves and his wife, Fatima Goss Graves.\n\nAttorney General Merrick B. Garland is the public face of the government's unprecedented effort to identify, arrest, and prosecute those connected to the Jan. 6, 2021 protest at the Capitol. But the person handling the day-to-day management of one of the largest and most politically freighted efforts in the history of American law enforcement has largely flown under the radar: Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.\n\nAn appointee of President Biden, Graves' office has prosecuted at least 1,100 Jan. 6 defendants - including roughly 200 people so far this year. Republicans claim that the Justice Department's steady pace of Jan. 6 arrests and Graves' prosecutions aim to keep one of Biden's animating narratives in the news - that, as the president put it , \"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.\"\n\nThe political nature of the Jan. 6 prosecutions is illustrated by the long partisan history of Graves and his wife, Fatima Goss Graves.\n\nAccording to documents on file with the U.S. Senate, Matthew Graves, a registered Democrat, served as a domestic policy adviser to the Biden campaign in 2020. According to the questionnaire submitted for his Senate confirmation, he \"assisted with Vice-Presidential vetting for the Kerry Campaign in 2004,\" resulting in the nomination of John Edwards, well before an extramarital affair got wide attention and helped end Edwards' 2008 presidential campaign. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's Democratic delegate to the House of Representatives, recommended Graves for his influential current post.\n\nRecently, Graves declined to pursue charges against Hunter Biden for tax offenses. And his wife is an influential progressive activist who has frequently visited the White House as her husband has pursued the president's political opponents.\n\nOne week after he was sworn into office, Graves indicted longtime Trump confidant Steve Bannon on two contempt of Congress charges, acting on a referral from then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's Jan. 6 Select Committee. Graves filed a separate indictment on the same charges against Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro in June 2022. Both men were quickly convicted by D.C. juries; Bannon's conviction is on appeal, with oral argument scheduled for October. Navarro's lawyers recently filed a motion seeking a new trial.\n\nMuch of Graves' work now involves prosecuting the steady stream of people the FBI has arrested in connection with Jan. 6. On Aug. 30, Nathan Hughes was taken into custody at a Fayetteville, Arkansas, mall by at least seven FBI agents brandishing rifles. That same morning at least 10 vehicles apparently driven by FBI agents and local law enforcement raided Hughes' Bentonville home. \"They ordered my girlfriend Taylor out of the house with her hands up and had rifles pointed at her too,\" Hughes would write . \"They put her in handcuffs, unplugged our home security cameras, and turned our house upside down searching it.\"\n\nAnother angle of the FBI arrest of Nathan Hughes over J6 The feds REALLY didn't want people getting close and videoing them pic.twitter.com/l6UFDMBGT5\n\nHughes was later indicted for assaulting or interfering with police, civil disorder, and three misdemeanors for his involvement in the Jan. 6 mayhem at the U.S. Capitol. Four other men were named as Hughes' co-defendants, charged for crimes they allegedly committed nearly 33 months ago. His case, like every other Jan. 6 case, is now transferred to Washington, D.C., the scene of the alleged \"attack on the Capitol.\"\n\nGraves appears to be making good on his pledge to double the number of Jan. 6 defendants, a growing caseload that monopolizes Department of Justice resources and clogs the D.C. federal court calendar with trials and hearings. Graves told The Washington Post in a February 2022 interview that \"somewhere around 2,000 people\" could be identified and charged before his work was over - or before the statute of limitations for most offenses expires in 2026.\n\nIn September, for example, Graves announced the arrest of 17 more individuals related to Jan. 6 - including Ray Epps, a man whom many suspect of being a plant of some sort, charged with a single misdemeanor offense . Graves also published his sixth report on the status of Jan. 6 cases documenting the number of convictions and categories of offenses: \"The Department of Justice's resolve to hold accountable those who committed crimes on January 6, 2021, has not, and will not, wane.\"\n\nNear-daily press releases trumpet details of the latest arrest, which are subsequently posted on Graves' social media account. Roughly three-quarters of the posts on X (formerly Twitter) are Jan. 6-related; at the same time, Graves is under fire for declining to prosecute 67 percent of violent crimes in the nation's capital amid an unabated crime wave. (Graves is the only U.S. attorney responsible for prosecuting federal and local crimes in his jurisdiction.)\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of Jan. 6 defendants face low-level nonviolent charges such as \"parading\" in the Capitol or remaining on restricted grounds, the Justice Department continues to cast the crimes committed as quite serious.\n\nFor example, despite the common description of Jan. 6 as an \"armed insurrection,\" only 10 percent of all defendants have been charged with a weapons violation, usually involving flag poles, riot shields, and pepper spray, not firearms. And no one has been charged with insurrection.\n\nSeparately, House Republicans have asked Graves to explain why he, according to IRS whistleblowers, declined to charge Hunter Biden for failing to report income in 2014 and 2015 during his time on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The IRS investigators told the House Ways and Means Committee that Graves overrode the recommendation of a career prosecutor in his office to protect the first son from prosecution in the matter.\n\nGraves is expected to sit for a transcribed interview with the House Judiciary Committee within the next few weeks.\n\nIn a statement to RealClearInvestigations, Tristan Leavitt, Jason Foster, and Mark Lytle, the legal team representing IRS whistleblower Gary Shapley, said that \"as an appointee of President Biden, U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves had no business making charging decisions regarding the President's son. Nor should he have even been consulted about the strengths or weakness of the case. The IRS whistleblowers' testimony to Congress suggests he became involved contemporaneous with the White House reiterating that the President believed his son had done nothing wrong, presenting a clear conflict of interest for Mr. Graves. That he overruled his own career First Assistant, as the IRS whistleblowers testified they had been informed, is even worse.\"\n\nConcerns about Graves' impartiality are intensified because of his wife's involvement in partisan issues and her closeness to the Biden White House. As president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center (NWLC) - whose primary focus is reforming the Supreme Court, demanding unrestricted access to abortion, and promoting LGBTQ rights - Fatima Goss Graves plays a crucial role in advancing priorities of Democrats and the Biden administration.\n\nAccording to government records, Goss Graves has visited the Biden White House at least 28 times since her husband was confirmed. Some appointments and events have involved the president, First Lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Democratic lawmakers, and top cabinet officials. (Logs also indicate Matthew Graves joined his wife for a Fourth of July barbecue at the White House in 2022.)\n\nEarlier this month, Goss Graves took part in a White House roundtable organized by top Biden advisers to discuss economic issues for black women. \"White House officials and participants discussed strategies for further closing wage gaps, as well as opportunities for partnership to continue advancing the economic security of Black women and their families,\" according to a White House readout of the Sept. 15 event.\n\nThe Graveses seem particularly close to Vice President Kamala Harris. Graves and Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff, were both partners at DLA Piper law firm in Washington before Graves took his new assignment. Goss Graves has attended several meetings with Harris and her staff over the past few years; her social media accounts feature numerous photos of the vice president.\n\nMeena Harris, the vice president's niece, is an NWLC board member. (It's unclear whether board members are compensated.)\n\nThe National Women's Law Center is a beneficiary of some of the richest foundations in the world; the Ford Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation are listed as donors in a report by InfluenceWatch. The Tides Foundation, heavily funded by global activist George Soros, has donated at least $45,000 to the NWLC since 2017.\n\nContributions spiked in 2021, the year Biden took office and her husband was confirmed as arguably the country's most powerful U.S. attorney. The group reported $67.7 million in assets in 2020; in 2021, that figure skyrocketed to $101.7 million, a 44 percent increase.\n\nThat same year, grant money from deep pockets tied to the Democratic Party started to flow in. Two of NWLC's largest benefactors are satellite nonprofits tied to Arabella Advisors, a multibillion-dollar \"consulting company\" run by a former Clinton administration official that the liberal Atlantic magazine has described as \"the massive progressive dark-money group you've never heard of\" and \"the indisputable heavyweight of Democratic dark money.\"\n\nThe NWLC received $993,000 from the New Venture Fund and $200,000 from the Hopewell Fund, two affiliates in Arabella's network, in 2021. Records indicate it was the first year either nonprofit donated to the NWLC.\n\nA big part of Goss Graves' work is delegitimizing and reconfiguring the Supreme Court. For example, she was deeply involved in the organized opposition to Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination in 2018. After President Trump announced Kavanaugh's nomination, Goss Graves spoke at a nighttime rally outside the Supreme Court. \"We are not going back to the days when women were considered a pre-existing condition,\" Graves shouted into the microphone as Sen. Bernie Sanders stood beside her. \"We know Judge Kavanaugh's record. We know Trump's promises. If we all join together, we will win this fight!\"\n\nGoss Graves then helped amplify unproven allegations that Kavanaugh committed sexual assault as a teen and college student. She accused Senate Republicans in 2018 of \"trotting out the 1991 playbook\" in comparing the treatment of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford to that of Clarence Thomas accuser Anita Hill. (Hill is a NWLC board member.) As co-founder of the \"Time's Up Defense Fund\" formed in response to the #MeToo movement, Graves helped organize a national walk-out in support of Ford and fellow Kavanaugh accuser Deborah Ramirez in September 2018.\n\nGoss Graves now is a leading figure in a broad coalition that wants Clarence Thomas removed from the Supreme Court for alleged ethics violations, which the justice vigorously denies. NWLC signed on to a six-figure ad campaign this spring as part of an umbrella organization called \"Alliance For Justice,\" demanding Thomas' resignation. The blitz involved posting \"video ads and banners that appeared online in major national outlets, including the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, Politico, Fox, and The Hill,\" according to the group's website.\n\nWhile ProPublica, The New York Times, and other influential outlets have suggested that the partisan, political efforts of Thomas' conservative wife, Ginni, raise questions about the justice's impartiality, they have ignored potential conflicts involving the Graveses.\n\nIn addition to enjoying close relationships with top officials in the Biden White House, Goss Graves also counts top Democratic lawmakers as friends and allies. In May, she joined Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Alex Padilla for a Capitol Hill press conference to publicly call for Thomas' resignation. Congressional Democrats are keeping the heat on Thomas; Whitehouse wants the body that oversees the federal judiciary to send a criminal referral to Attorney General Merrick Garland and ask the DOJ to open an investigation into Thomas for failing to report income and gifts.\n\nBut Goss Graves' perceived political enemies don't just wear black robes; some wear yoga gear and business suits. She recently unleashed a fierce tirade against Moms for Liberty, a group fighting woke ideology, among other issues in public school curriculums. Writing in Philadelphia Gay News in July, Goss Graves accused Moms for Liberty of \"actively terrorizing parents, teachers, and worst of all - our children - claiming to do so in the name of 'parental rights.'\"\n\n\"Moms for Liberty is anything but a grassroots band of moms who just care about their kids. Instead, let's call it out for what it is: they're deeply entrenched in a mutually beneficial relationship with the GOP machine.\" Goss Graves noted that the Southern Poverty Law Center this year designated Moms for Liberty an \"extremist group\" in a recent report.\n\nThe CEO and president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, Margaret Huang, sits on the NWLC board of directors.\n\nNo issue, however, seems to animate Goss Graves more than abortion. She routinely testifies to Congress about the need to protect unfettered access to abortion with no restrictions. During a July 2022 House hearing on the impact of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, Goss Graves said that \"access to abortion is a key part of a person's liberty, equality, and economic security\" and warned the opinion could \"signal a rollback of other fundamental rights, including the rights to contraception, same-sex marriage, and consensual sexual relations, among others.\"\n\nSuggesting a connection between her politics and her husband's official actions, critics note that Matthew Graves indicted nine pro-lifers last year in connection with a non-violent October 2020 protest in Washington, D.C., accusing the individuals of engaging in a \"conspiracy to create a blockade at the reproductive health care clinic to prevent the clinic from providing, and patients from receiving, reproductive health services.\" The conspiracy, according to Graves, involved \"blockading two clinic doors using their bodies, furniture, chains and ropes.\"\n\nAll nine were convicted by D.C. juries in two separate trials and taken into immediate custody per Graves' request; they now are being held in a D.C. jail awaiting sentencing. (Defendants include three women in their 70s.) All face up to 11 years in prison.\n\nGoss Graves has a record of publicly expressing racially tinged views related to Donald Trump and his supporters. Writing for CNN in November 2020, Goss Graves criticized white women who voted for Trump. \"To be clear, most White women who support Trump are not blindly voting against their own self-interest. These Trump supporters, aided by a toxic mix of racism and disinformation, seem to be consciously supporting what they believe to be their own group interest, putting them on the same team as the White men society has been largely built to benefit.\"\n\nWhite women who oppose Trump, Goss Graves continued, \"need to push to dismantle systemic racism within White communities. This includes having difficult conversations with other White women in their families and communities to address and stop implicit bias, end racism, and move forward the common causes that are shared with women regardless of race, gender, sexuality and disability.\"\n\nAfter Jan. 6, Goss Graves issued a statement on behalf of the NWLC calling for Trump's impeachment. She referred to Capitol protesters as \"terrorists\" and demanded that Trump's \"enablers\" in Congress \"must be held accountable for their attempt to subvert our democracy.\"\n\n\"The disconnect between the treatment of peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters this summer and violent insurrectionists this week puts our unequal society on full display, making all the more clear the national travesty Black people have lived with for generations.\"\n\nGraves told Congress earlier this year that his predecessors dropped many of the charges filed against those responsible for the 2020 riots in Washington after the police killing of George Floyd. And his office has not brought new charges against anyone involved in the mayhem, which lasted for weeks and resulted in more destruction than the events of Jan. 6, along with hundreds of assaults on federal law enforcement officers, according to a government report. Graves also has not indicted individuals who attempted to assault lawmakers leaving a White House event in September 2020 or those who attacked Trump supporters during election rallies in November and December 2020.\n\nGraves, however, did help settle a civil lawsuit between BLM rioters - whom his office described as \"racial justice demonstrators\" - and law enforcement related to accusations of excessive force at Lafayette Square in 2020. \"We appreciate the Park Police and Secret Service for their efforts to constantly review and revisit their law enforcement policies to evolve and protect those that seek to peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights,\" Graves said in an April 2022 press release .\n\nGraves' office declined to comment. The NWLC did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThis article was originally published by RealClear Investigations.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Garland Makes An Example Of J6 Protesters To Shut Up Anyone Else Who Might Question Elections\n\n'I think our prosecutions have made clear what we think about people who try to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power,' Garland said.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland boasted on Friday how his office has prosecuted nearly 1,500 Americans for protesting the 2020 election, warning others they may face similar lawfare should they raise any concerns about the administration of the upcoming November election.\n\nSpeaking at a press briefing, Garland essentially said the Jan. 6 prosecutions should serve to remind Americans what happens if they raise questions about an election.\n\n\"I think our prosecutions have made clear what we think about people who try to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power, which is [an] essential and fundamental element of our democracy. A quibble about whether we have 1,500 or slightly less than 1,500 - but we have way more than 1400 now - prosecutions. We have a substantial number of convictions,\" Garland boasted.\n\n\"I think that's shown to everybody how seriously we take an effort to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power the last January 6, the coming January 6, and every January 6 after that,\" he continued. \"I want to make clear to anybody who is thinking about interfering with that: They can see what we've done with respect to the January 6 prosecutions, and [the] Justice Department will continue to protect our democracy.\"\n\nDirector at Big Data Poll Richard Baris explained in a post on X why Garland's comments are so alarming.\n\n\"This is what 50% of the country heard from Garland. 'We're gonna steal this election and if you try to fight us, we'll put you in prison.' God this country is totally corrupt,\" he wrote.\n\n\"DOJ prosecutors and DC judges are warning that the hammer will come down on any American who protests the 2024 election results,\" echoed independent journalist Julie Kelly on X after Garland made his press conference statement. \"They treat J6ers like mass murderers,\" she continued, citing comments from Obama-appointed District Judge Tanya Chutkan \"lecturing a J6 protestor convicted of a misdemeanor.\"\n\nThe DOJ brought the \"hammer\" down in the wake of the 2020 election, as Garland made clear. The DOJ charged hundreds of protesters - including a \" praying grandma \" in her 70s - under a federal statute that the Supreme Court later ruled was used in an over-broad capacity.\n\nBut American skepticism about our electoral processes, in part, stems from the actions the DOJ has taken, starting with their attempt to criminalize election-related speech.\n\nUnder Garland's watch, the DOJ targeted former President Donald Trump for his speech on Jan. 6 in which he told his supporters who wanted to protest the election to do so \"peacefully and patriotically.\" As my colleague Matt Kittle explained , those words \"became the impetus for charges of 'insurrection' and 'election interference.'\"\n\nGarland has also sought to undermine attempts to secure elections, vowing in March to fight \"burdensome\" and \"unnecessary\" election security laws like voter ID requirements despite a Pew Research study finding 81 percent of Americans support requiring people to show a \"government-issued photo identification\" in order to vote.\n\nMore recently, the DOJ asked the Supreme Court to \"deny\" Republicans' bid \"to enforce an Arizona law requiring individuals to prove they're U.S. citizens when registering and voting in elections,\" as my colleague Shawn Fleetwood explained . Currently, voters simply need to check a box on a federal registration form affirming they are a citizen. In a nation overrun with millions of illegal immigrants, we're relying on the honor system to register voters.\n\nBut it's not just the DOJ's actions that have led Americans to feel increasing distrust toward election administration.\n\nThe Washington, D.C. bar recommended that Trump-era DOJ official Jeffrey Clark be suspended for at least two years because he drafted a letter to Georgia officials in which he said the DOJ \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the [2020] election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.\"\n\nNotably, the 2020 election in Georgia was certified, though the State Election Board passed a motion this past May finding Fulton County double-scanned 3,075 ballots. The board did not issue a rule on the 17,852 votes that were, according to a complaint filed by Kevin Moncla and Joseph Rossi, allegedly missing ballot images in the county.\n\nElection meddler Marc Elias, who was recently hired by Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, also recently warned in a post on X that questioning election administration could land you in court.\n\n\"Here is my message to the GOP: If you try to subvert the election in 2024, you will be sued and you will lose,\" he wrote.\n\nIn 2020, Trump tried to overturn the election. My team and I beat him in court 60+ times. In 2022, Republicans in several counties refused to certify. We sued and won. Here is my message to the GOP: If you try to subvert the election in 2024, you will be sued and you will lose.\n\nIt's the same message being sent in key swing states like Georgia and Nevada.\n\nFulton County board member Julie Adams voted not to certify the March presidential preference primary after claiming she was denied access to election data such as the qualified voter list, the voter check-in list, and drop-box ballot recap sheets, among other items. Ten days later, the Democrat Party of Georgia sent a letter to the entire Fulton County board warning that, should board members not certify election results, they could face criminal charges.\n\nNevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar and Attorney General Aaron D. Ford filed a petition in July with the state Supreme Court to force Washoe County to certify the results of two recount primary races. Three board members initially chose not to certify the results over allegations of suspicious behavior made during a public comment portion of a board meeting.\n\nThe state Supreme Court dismissed the petition as \"moot,\" though it did signal a similar challenge could be brought by the state should an election not be certified this election cycle.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "'The View's' Sunny Hostin Retains Bat Guano Crazy Queen Crown\n\nThe co-host at ABC's home for the criminally delusional compared the J6 riots to World War II, the Holocaust and slavery.\n\nIn this ever-changing world, it can be comforting to know that some things will never change. Like \" The View \" will never be anything resembling sane. And \"The View's\" Sunny Hostin remains queen of bat guano crazy.\n\nExpectedly, Sunny went on a rant Monday - marking the fourth-anniversary of the political demonstration at the U.S. Capitol that turned riotous with her usual flare for hyperventilating hyperbole.\n\nThe co-host at ABC's home for the criminally delusional insisted \"we need to find moral clarity.\" (Don't you love being lectured about \"moral clarity\" from people with suspect moral compasses?) Where have all the moral giants gone, like former Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell? Sunny lamented.\n\n\"I just remember after Jan. 6 you had someone like Mitch McConnell placing the blame on Jan. 6 where it belongs, squarely on Donald Trump's shoulders,\" she fondly recalled. \"And then you started seeing people backtrack that and losing their moral center. You had Condoleeza Rice, I believe, on this very show, saying, 'You know, we have to move on from Jan. 6.'\"\n\nYes, the former secretary of state had the audacity to say that politicians should be focusing on concerns everyday Americans were talking about, like rapidly rising grocery and gas prices, and that teaching white kids that they are natural-born racists in a systemically white supremacist America is wrong. That was in October 2021 . Americans had just begun to wade into the misery of the Biden years. Sunny glowered at Rice, insisting that the \"past will become prologue if we don't find out what happened on Jan. 6.\" She really likes the \"past is prologue\" line.\n\nWell, we have learned quite a bit about \"what happened on Jan. 6,\" and the facts don't comport with the politically driven narrative that \"insurrection\" peddlers like the morally bankrupt Liz Cheney and Adam Schiff have been selling. My Federalist colleague Tristan Justice on Monday detailed \" The Top 10 Lies Of Liz Cheney And The January 6th Committee .\"\n\nWhat we learned from November's election is that voters didn't buy the lie that Jan. 6, 2021 was the \"darkest day\" in U.S. history, as delusional leftists still expect us to swallow.\n\nAnd the beat goes on for The View's Sunny Hostin, who insisted that Jan. 6, 2021 was an \"atrocity.\" There is to be no moving on in Sunny's bleak world.\n\n\"It was one of the worst moments in American history,\" the lawyer-turned-talk-show-host declared to applause from The View's brainwashed audience. How bad was it? Holocaust bad, Sunny said.\n\n\"And when you think about the worst moments in American history, you know, like World War II, things that happened like the Holocaust, chattel slavery ...\" she asserted.\n\nThe View's Sunny Hostin is melting down: \"You don't move on because January 6th was one of the worst moments in American history, like World War Two, the Holocaust, slavery.\" pic.twitter.com/zO6krRRgDB\n\nReally? World War II? Really?\n\nNope.\n\nWorld War II was \"the largest and most violent conflict in human history,\" according to the Defense Casualty Analysis System and anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of world history. An estimated 15 million human beings died in battle, with another 45 million-plus civilians killed, according to the National World War II Museum in New Orleans . The United States alone counted at least 418,500 dead over the course of its engagement. You get those kinds of fatalities in a world war.\n\nHow about the Holocaust? Not even close, Sunny.\n\n\" The Holocaust was the systematic, state-sponsored, persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators between 1933 and 1945 across Europe and North Africa. The height of the persecution and murder occurred during World War II. By the end of the war in 1945, the Germans and their collaborators had killed nearly two out of every three European Jews,\" the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum sadly records. Millions more non-Jews also were persecuted and slaughtered.\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021 gathering at the Capitol was mostly a  demonstration of frustrated Americans who believed the 2020 presidential election was rigged. It grew unruly and ultimately riotous. It was not a \"mostly violent\" rebellion. It was not an insurrection. Democracy wasn't anywhere close to dying. If that were true, as a friend wrote following Sunny's absurd comments, \"the J6ers nearly toppled democracy with fake gallows and an orderly tour through the Capitol with zero firearms.\"\n\nTwo people directly died from the riots: Trump supporters Ashli Babbitt, who was shot by a Capitol police officer, and Roseanne Boyland, trampled in the crush of the crowd.\n\nWATCH: CNN's @ScottJenningKY NUKES Sunny Hostin for comparing January 6 to the Holocaust and slavery: \"In light of all the rhetoric and things we're going to hear people say today is that, ultimately, it was the American people who got to decide ultimately how we feel... pic.twitter.com/C9sIDcwFSf\n\nThe events of Jan. 6, 2021 bear no resemblance to \"chattel slavery,\" a very anti-democratic business Sunny's ancestors apparently were well acquainted with, according to some disappointing genetic testing .\n\nThe View co-host, again, insisted \"we need to never forget\" Jan. 6 \"because past becomes prologue if you forget and erase.\"\n\nBut what happens when useful idiots have no concept of history or sense of proportion? Well, you get the queen of bat guano crazy, Sunny Hostin.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "After J6 Pardons, The FBI And DOJ Have Nothing To Show For Four Years Of Ignoring Terrorists And Child Traffickers\n\nOver the last four years, Americans watched as the FBI and the Department of Justice worked overtime to imprison the citizens who bankroll them for daring to dissent from the Biden regime's narratives. On his first day in office, with one stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump not only reversed that lawfare, but effectively solidified the premier federal law enforcement agencies' places as some of the most corrupt, inefficient, and incompetent arms of the federal government.\n\nFor both the DOJ and the FBI, the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot witch hunt was everything. Both devoted an unprecedented amount of resources to tracking down anyone and everyone with a connection to Jan. 6 events,  from grandmas who were let into the Capitol by police to those who merely attended Trump's Save America rally miles away from the chaos.\n\nThe FBI and DOJ manipulated data and narratives to exaggerate the prominence of \"domestic terrorism,\" portraying it as the greatest terrorism threat to the country. The department and the agency used this manufactured campaign not only to go after Trump supporters, but also to pursue Trump himself.\n\nThe FBI, spurred by the DOJ's promise to prosecute so-called \"threats to democracy,\" was so committed to its J6 inquisition that it reassigned agents tasked with tackling child sexual abuse cases to capturing people who entered the Capitol. Similarly, the DOJ shirked its duty to investigate Hunter Biden - whose tax, gun, and apparent Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) misconduct were only the tip of the Biden family corruption iceberg - in favor of harassing Catholics , concerned parents , pro-lifers , and J6ers.\n\nEven after devoting excessive time, resources, and agents to the partisan persecution of the Biden regime's political enemies, the FBI still can't answer key questions about what went down on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWho planted the pipe bombs at the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee headquarters remains a mystery. Exactly how many FBI informants were involved in the Capitol chaos was also a guessing game until the recent release of an inspector general report , which circumvented the agency's refusal to disclose that fact.\n\nBoth Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray were too busy playing victim in the pages of The Washington Post and in front of the same Congress they did everything to stonewall to do accomplish anything positive. Instead, they squandered an unconscionable amount of taxpayer dollars to throw their opponents in prison.\n\nTrump's swift decision to pardon the more than 1500 Americans who found themselves the target of a Democrat operation to portray them as the villains in the \"darkest day in U.S. history\" wasn't just a victory against the deep state. It was also a testament to the DOJ's and FBI's all-around worthlessness and ability to waste time on investigations that did nothing to make the country better or safer.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Trump's J6 Pardons Signal The End Of The War On Wrongthink\n\nThe Capitol riot fueled the war on wrongthink. Clemency for Capitol rioters should represent the start of the end of that war.\n\nIn the four years since the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, Democrats have crushed and disenfranchised their political opponents in a bid to achieve total power by waging a whole-of-society war on wrongthink. This war encompassed , among other elements, the lawfare apparatus, the broader weaponized administrative state, and the Censorship-Industrial Complex.\n\nNow, with President Trump's many corrective actions during week one of his second term, we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of this tyrannical war - the first step toward restoring liberty and justice in this country.\n\nTrump began by issuing an executive order called \" Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government .\" Under that order, the president declared it U.S. policy to \"identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to the weaponization of law enforcement and the weaponization of the Intelligence Community.\"\n\nThe directive tasks the attorney general, alongside department and agency heads, with investigating weaponized acts by civil or criminal enforcement authorities over the last four years and presenting a report to the president \"with recommendations for appropriate remedial actions.\" The order calls on the director of national intelligence to initiate the same review for weaponized acts of the intelligence community.\n\nThe devil will be in the details. But if these reviews result in a comprehensive accounting of the malfeasance that transpired, the punishing of those who abused their powers, and the replacement of personnel and reform of policy to prevent future such corruption, this order alone would constitute a massive \"W\" for the republic.\n\nBut the president was not done there. He also issued an executive order on \"Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship,\" which prohibits federal employees from engaging in, facilitating, or using taxpayer dollars for \"any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen.\" Like the weaponization order, it also calls on the attorney general and relevant agency heads to probe censorship activities during the last four years and present recommendations for remedial actions.\n\nGiven that the federal government provided much of the direction, coordination, and funding that fueled the censorship regime - which was imposed upon Americans over the past decade and intensified over the last four years - this order represents a potentially crippling blow to its entire foundation. As I detailed at RealClearInvestigations, President Trump has telegraphed that this is likely just the opening salvo in a broader effort to dismantle and destroy the Censorship-Industrial Complex.\n\nThe actions to end the war on wrongthink even extend across the globe. President Biden issued an unprecedented Executive Order 14115, under which his administration targeted ally Israel's citizens and threatened its leaders with sanctions for daring to oppose White House policies that would imperil Israelis' life, liberty, and property - beginning with rewarding the Palestinians for Oct. 7, 2023, with a state. That order was predicated on a sort of blood libel that Jews living in the biblical heartland of Judea and Samaria were engaging in rampant violence against their Arab neighbors. President Trump revoked the despicable order on his first day.\n\nIn addition to setting policies to provide accountability and prevent go-forward malfeasance, the administration has already started righting past wrongs. The Trump Justice Department immediately began dismissing outrageous lawsuits, like the one against whistleblowing doctor Eithan Haim , who had exposed that Texas Children's Hospital was illegally giving children transgender procedures. Likewise, it ended prosecutions against pro-lifers for alleged FACE Act violations and pardoned the overwhelmingly peaceful protesters persecuted by the Biden Justice Department under that law. The administration announced it would reinstate service members booted from the military for refusing to get the Covid jab, with back pay and benefits.\n\nBut perhaps most notable of all was Trump's decision to dismiss all pending cases against Jan. 6 defendants - with prejudice - and provide blanket pardons and a limited number of commutations to the more than 1,500 J6ers already prosecuted for the riot used to launch the war on wrongthink.\n\nThat decision took courage. It would have been more politically correct to do a bifurcated set of pardons based on the nature of alleged offenses. But the administration evidently considered Jan. 6 in its totality in deciding to end the entire lawfare inquisition.\n\nReports suggest the administration weighed the vigorous and seemingly vengeful J6 prosecutions against the leniency granted to Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters who assaulted cops, murdered people, and burned down cities during the summer of 2020. It likely considered the grave defects to the cases: D.C. judges heaped collective guilt on the defendants and treated them with hostility, authorities violated their due process rights, and defendants faced perhaps the most anti-MAGA jury pools in America while judges refused to let them change venues.\n\nThe administration surely recognized, as the Supreme Court confirmed , that prosecutors twisted and tortured laws like the Enron-driven \"obstruction of an official proceeding\" charge to hang felonies around the necks of protesters. It understood that some without any prior criminal records were subjected to pretrial detention for months on end, with many subjected to alleged abuse in squalid jail conditions. It also appears to have acknowledged the complexity of judging people's offenses given the presence of informants who may have entrapped some and the reported provocations, if not brutality, of individual police officers.\n\nIn short, the president seemingly surmised that the prosecutions were the fruit of a poisonous tree - and were themselves poisoned. Punishment had already been more than meted out. Law enforcement resources were better allocated toward not treating grandmas wandering the Capitol grounds like jihadists, and the American people had rendered their judgment on Jan. 6, 2021, which justified ending the entire sordid lawfare effort. Outgoing President Biden's cavalier and corrupt pardons and commutations only made the decision easier .\n\nThe Capitol riot fueled the war on wrongthink. Clemency for Capitol rioters, perhaps above all other opening actions, should represent the start of the end of that war.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

We can clean house next term, and that's what has to happen.\"\n\n\"The investigators will be investigated ... We can clean house next term, and that's what has to happen.\"\n\nIt's a difficult decision for some Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers who have spent the last four years in the Biden administration forcing lawfare on President-elect Donald Trump: stay in government and risk facing Trump's wrath or get out before Inauguration Day.\n\nThere are dozens of DOJ prosecutors who have been involved with anti-Trump cases that didn't just target the incoming president but J6 protesters and key Trump aides like Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro , The Wall Street Journal reported . Those who feel most vulnerable have solicited the advice of Attorney General Merrick Garland, who has reportedly advised them to stay put in order to preserve the corporate memory of the DOJ.\n\nThat counsel has apparently not always been embraced as many department lawyers are sending out their CVs in an attempt to return to private law. While a new president can be expected to purge the government of political staffers,\"now, it's seeping into a lot of career people,\" Steve Nelson, a legal headhunter who helps lawyers get back to private law firms, told the WSJ.\n\n\"The number of people leaving, or looking at opportunities outside the Justice Department or elsewhere in the government, is way higher than it's ever been before,\" Nelson told the WSJ.\n\nBut although a slew of DOJ lawyers might aspire to pack up and leave, it's not like there are a lot of vacancies at the lucrative law practices. So many of them are deciding to stay put and take their chances, preparing as best they can for the worst-case scenario of being subject to the same legal persecution that they have meted out to Trump and his allies.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith is perhaps the best example of a DOJ prosecutor who made a visceral enemy of Trump with their election interference charges and allegations that he improperly cared for classified documents. Smith has moved on from both of these actions, acknowledging that the DOJ does not prosecute a sitting president. His investigations ate up $50 million taxpayer dollars.\n\nPam Bondi, who is Trump's nominee for attorney general, has indicated that she believes some retribution against the Biden DOJ would be justified. \"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors, will be prosecuted, the bad ones,\" The WSJ quotes Bondi as saying on Fox News last year. \"The investigators will be investigated ... We can clean house next term, and that's what has to happen.\"\n\nKash Patel, who is Trump's choice to be the next director of the FBI, has also mused about getting even with the Democrats, although he has been telling senators that he has no intention of initiating any persecution against the Democrats who used the judiciary against Trump. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) has said he believes him .\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

In a press conference earlier in January, Trump told reporters from Mar-a-Lago, \"We're looking at it, and we have other people in there,\" Trump said. He then added that there were people who did \"some bad things weren't prosecuted, and people that didn't even walk into the building are in jail right now. So, we'll be looking at the whole thing.

Due to the corrupt process of these prosecutions, President Trump rightly decided to grant a broad pardon to all wrongfully convicted January 6 protestors.\"\n\n\"Despite the mainstream media's obsession with January 6, the outgoing administration's application of presidential pardons for members of the Biden family are far more deserving of additional media scrutiny,\" Van Kirk added.\n\nA source familiar with the matter said that Vance had been advocating for blanket pardons for January 6 defendants since day one of the transition.\n\nVance had said on Fox News Sunday earlier in January, \"I think it's very simple: Look, if you protested peacefully on January the 6th and you've had Merrick Garland's Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned. And there's a little bit of a gray area there, but we're very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law. And there are a lot of people, we think, in the wake of January the 6th who were prosecuted unfairly. We need to rectify that.\"\n\nVance received pushback for the comments, including from commentators The Hodgetwins, who wrote, \"Better rethink what you just said JD.\" Vance wrote in response, \"First of all, I donated to the to the J6 political prisoner fund and got ROASTED for it during my senate race. I've been defending these guys for years. Second, there were federal informants in the crowd. Do they get a pardon? I don't think so. The president saying he'll look at each case (and me saying the same) is not some walkback. I assure you, we care about people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it includes people who got a garbage trial.\" In the final hours of Biden's term as president, he issued pardons for five of his family members. Pardons were issued for brother James Biden and his wife Sara Jones Biden, sister Valerie Biden Owens and husband John T Owens, and brother Francis W Biden. Biden wrote, \"My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me-the worst kind of partisan politics. Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end.\" Biden said, \"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.\" Biden also issued a pardon for his son, Hunter, in December. On the night of Trump's first day back in office, he signed pardons for around 1,500 January 6 defendants. Trump had vowed to issue pardons for these defendants throughout his campaign and beyond. In Trump's cover interview with Time Magazine in December, he echoed similar comments to Vance, saying \"I'm going to do case-by-case, and if they were non-violent, I think they've been greatly punished.

He also reiterated that he would not instruct the FBI or Department of Justice to target political opponents.\n\nTrump stated that he would act \"very quickly\" on his first day in office to issue pardons to those incarcerated over January 6, describing their conditions as \"living in hell.\"\n\n\"They've been in there for years, and they're in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldn't even be allowed to be open,\" Trump said.\n\nAccording to NBC News , at least 1,572 people have been charged in connection with January 6, with over 1,251 convicted or pleading guilty. Approximately 645 defendants have been sentenced to incarceration, ranging from several days to 22 years.\n\nTrump acknowledged that there might be exceptions to pardons, stating, \"If somebody was radical, crazy,\" they would not be pardoned. The president-elect did not rule out pardoning those who pleaded guilty, arguing that \"they had no voice.\" Many traded guilty pleas for lesser sentences.\n\n\"I know the system. The system's a very corrupt system,\" Trump explained. \"They say to a guy, 'You're going to go to jail for two years or for 30 years.' And these guys are looking, their whole lives have been destroyed. For two years, they've been destroyed. But the system is a very nasty system.\"\n\nTrump went on to accuse members of the January 6 Committee of destroying evidence to promote a certain narrative about the events that unfolded that day, referencing claims by House Republicans earlier this year that the committee deleted and hid records. Trump singled out former committee members Liz Cheney and Bennie Thompson, stating, \"Honestly, they should go to jail.\" However, he clarified that he would not direct his FBI director or attorney general to prosecute them, leaving such decisions to law enforcement. NBC's write-up of the exchange focused on Trump saying that the members of the January 6 committee \"should be in jail.\"\n\nWhen asked about his potential FBI director, Kash Patel, investigating figures he has accused of corruption, Trump said Patel would have an obligation to pursue wrongdoing but insisted he would not direct such actions. Trump reiterated that he is \"not looking to go back into the past\" regarding investigations into President Joe Biden and said he would not instruct his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to launch probes.\n\n\"I'm looking to make our country successful. Retribution will be through success,\" Trump said.\n\nFurther, he also addressed special counsel Jack Smith, who brought federal charges against him that were later dropped after the election. Trump described Smith as \"very corrupt\" but emphasized he would leave any decision to investigate Smith up to Bondi, saying he wants \"her to do what she wants to do\" and is \"not going to instruct her to do it.\"\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Rather, to the extent keywords or phrases were suggested, it was expected they would be used alongside other factors and data that banks regularly analyze as part of their AML programs to detect and report suspicious activity.\" \"A document distributed on January 15, 2021 suggested that banks could review payment messages for indications that an individual participated in the assault on the Capitol and included terms such as 'antifa,' 'MAGA,' 'Trump,' 'Biden,' 'Kamala,' 'Schumer,' and 'Pelosi,' along with terms indicating an intent to do violence, such as \"shoot,\" \"kill,\" \"murder\" and \"storm the Capitol.\" The letter notes that the FinCEN under the prior administration continued this process until mid-Feb 2021 while law enforcement was concerned about threats on the upcoming presidential inauguration. The letter was in response to Rep. Scott sending a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Director of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Andrea Gacki, demanding to know if the departments had \"urged private financial institutions to surveil customers' transaction-level data using politically charged search terms, in order to flag certain customer profiles on behalf of Federal law enforcement.\" He noted that the allegations, \"If true, represent a flagrant violation of Americans' privacy and the improper targeting of U.S. citizens for exercising their constitutional rights without due process.\" Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), also noted in a post on X in January that if you purchased a \"religious text, like a BIBLE, or shopped at Bass Pro Shop\" your transaction was flagged. This report comes after FBI whistleblowers alleged in November that the Bureau targeted agents who had expressed holding conservative or Christian beliefs.\n\n2024.02.09 Response to Rank... by Jack\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
