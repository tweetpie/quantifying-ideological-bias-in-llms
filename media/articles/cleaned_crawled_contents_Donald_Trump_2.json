      "text": "Trump Cabinet official doubts seniors would be upset over missed Social Security payments\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks in the Oval Office at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 21, 2025. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's closest advisors is now suggesting that most of the tens of millions of Americans who rely on Social Security wouldn't be concerned if they didn't receive their benefits.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on the All-In Podcast with Chamath Palihapitiya and David Friedberg, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick vociferously defended the Trump administration's mass firings and budget cuts to multiple federal agencies. He also heaped praise on South African centibillionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) - particularly his controversial goal of cutting Social Security.\n\nIn one exchange, Lutnick - who has a net worth of approximately $2 billion according to Investopedia - suggested that the best approach to root out fraud within the Social Security Administration (SSA) was to \"stop payments and listen.\" He also argued that only a \"fraudster\" would call the SSA if they missed their monthly Social Security payment.\n\n\"I describe it to people this way: Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law, who is 94, she wouldn't call and complain. She just wouldn't. She'd think something got messed up, and she'll get it next month,\" said Lutnick, who paid for his 16,250 square-foot mansion with $25 million in cash . \"A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining.\"\n\n\"Elon [Musk] knows this by heart,\" he continued. \"Anyone who's been in the payment system and the process system knows the easiest way to find a fraudster is to stop payments and listen. Because whoever screams is the one stealing!\"\n\nLutnick's assertion that Social Security beneficiaries would be unbothered by a missed payment ignores the fact that for millions of recipients, those monthly benefits are critical. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nearly four in 10 American adults aged 65 and up would have incomes below the official poverty line without Social Security. Alex Lawson, who is executive director of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told AlterNet that Lutnick's remarks reveal \"the problem with government by the billionaires for the billionaires.\"\n\n\"They have no idea what life is like for ordinary Americans. Living in lazy luxury means Lutnick cannot understand that for millions of Americans, missing a single Social Security check means they can't eat, they can't pay their rent, they can't live,\" Lawson said. \"I cannot imagine a more offensive and out of touch comment, it would be funny if it weren't actually terrifying.\"\n\nWatch the video of Lutnick's comments below, or by clicking this link."

      "text": "'I am your retribution': Inside Trump's new 'grudge tour'\n\nOne of the most famous lines of Donald Trump's 2024 campaign was \"I am your retribution.\" That line wasn't aimed at swing voters - some of whom were drawn to Trump's economic messaging and were frustrated over inflation - but at hardcore MAGA base voters who had voted for him in 2016 and 2020.\n\nHardcore MAGA Republicans applauded Trump's message of revenge against political enemies - a theme he continued to embrace after returning to the White House on January 20.\n\nIn an article published on March 21 , Axios' Zachary Basu details the ways in which Trump - now two months into his second presidency - is trying to get back at those he considers political enemies.\n\n\"In the final days of the 2024 campaign,\" Basu explains , \"Axios identified a list of perceived adversaries who fit what Trump ominously described as 'the enemies from within.' As president, he has taken steps to retaliate against virtually all of them.... Trump has revoked security clearances from former President (Joe) Biden, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.\"\n\nBasu continues , \"The FBI is investigating the Biden Administration's handling of an EPA grant program, after a senior (Department of Justice) official resigned rather than pursue a criminal inquiry that she believed was baseless.... On Monday, (March 17), Trump announced he was terminating Secret Service protection for Biden's son and daughter, Hunter and Ashley, 'effective immediately.'\"\n\nThe Axios reporter notes that some of Trump's targets are Republicans who served in his first administration. For example, Trump removed U.S. Secret Service protection for former National Security Director John Bolton and ex-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (who is also a former CIA director) despite threats against them from Iran.\n\n\"Trump despises his former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, (Gen. Mark Milley), who called the president 'fascist to the core' in 2023,\" Basu observes . \"Trump yanked both his security clearance and personal security detail.... Trump claimed, this week, that Biden's preemptive pardons of (former Rep. Liz) Cheney and other members of the January 6 Committee are 'void' because of Biden's alleged use of an autopen.\"\n\nTrump, Basu adds , also \"stripped security clearances from New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in retaliation for their investigations into his business practices\" and \"fired and demoted federal prosecutors and FBI officials involved in the investigation of the January 6 riot, while pardoning thousands of his supporters who were convicted for breaking into the Capitol.\"\n\n\"Trump's plans to accelerate his grudge tour were laid bare in an extraordinary speech last week at the Justice Department, in which he falsely referred to himself as 'the chief law enforcement officer in the country,\" Basu writes . \"That's actually his attorney general, Pam Bondi. Addressing an agency that has long prided itself on its independence, Trump attacked his political enemies as \"scum\" and called for them to be jailed.\"\n\nRead the full Axios article at this link ."

His comments followed those of Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas) , who pledged to file articles of impeachment against the \"activist\" judge.\n\nTrump's remarks prompted U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to warn that \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" advising those who oppose federal rulings to do so via \"the normal appellate review process.\"\n\nRoberts' warning didn't stop anonymous critics on social media from demanding that Boasberg be sent to Guantánamo Bay \"for 20 years\" and calling him a \"terrorist-loving judge.\"\n\nFar-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who traveled with Trump during his campaign last year, told her 1.5 million social media followers that the judge's family \"is a national security threat.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) on Thursday likened the response of Trump and the MAGA movement to the judiciary to setting loose \"flying monkeys to intimidate judges and their families.\"\n\nSupreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, one of the court's right-wing judges who was appointed by Trump, broke with the other conservative justices earlier this month when she ruled against the president's freeze on foreign aid- prompting allies of the president to deride Coney Barrett as a \"closet Democrat\" and a \"DEI hire,\" referring to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that Trump has pushed to end.\n\nDays after the ruling, Coney Barrett's sister received a threat-which turned out to be false-that there was a pipe bomb in her mailbox.\n\nJudge John C. Coughenour of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington also reported that he had been targeted by a \"swatting\" attack, in which a false tip was sent to local law enforcement, prompting officers to show up at the judge's home expecting to find an armed intruder. The attack followed Coughenour's ruling that blocked Trump's order attempting to abolish birthright citizenship.\n\nReuters reported earlier this this month that \"U.S. marshals have warned judges of unusually high threat levels.\"\n\n\"Security has been bolstered for some judges assigned cases over Trump administration initiatives,\" the outlet reported.\n\nThe government watchdog Public Citizen said the threats against judges who rule against Trump is a \"red flag.\"\n\n\"This presidency is starting to look a lot like a dictatorship,\" said the group.\n\nMaggie Jo Buchanan, interim executive director of the court reform advocacy group Demand Justice, said that \"judges should not face threats of impeachment, violence, or worse, simply for doing their jobs and upholding their oaths to the rule of law and Constitution.\"\n\n\"Criticism and public discourse around rulings is a part of our democracy,\" said Buchanan. \"Threats and intimidation are not.\""

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nOne major law firm targeted by President Donald Trump's administration appears to have reached an agreement with the president to get out of his crosshairs. But some experts are alleging that the deal has ominous implications.\n\nThe New York Times Michael A. Schmidt reported Thursday that the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (Paul Weiss) made several key commitments to the Trump administration after it was targeted in an executive order. The agreement was reached after Paul Weiss' chair visited the White House and met with Trump.\n\nEarly on in his second term, Trump issued executive orders mentioning three specific law firms that stripped their attorneys of security clearances and threatened to terminate their federal contracts. But on Thursday, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he would rescind the order targeting Paul Weiss after the firm agreed to contribute $40 million in pro bono legal services aligned with the administration's goals, and that it wouldn't pursue \"DEI policies\" in its hiring.\n\n\"Law firms should not favor any political party when it comes to choosing their clients,\" Trump wrote. \"Firms also should not make decisions on whom to hire based on a person's political affiliation.\"\n\nHowever, legal experts on social media condemned the agreement as transactional and corrupt. American Immigration Council senior fellow Aaron Reichlin-Melnick tweeted : \"There's a word for this: shakedown.\"\n\n\"God help our country when the President of the United States is personally shaking down his political opponents for money,\" he wrote.\n\nOthers shared similar sentiments. Bulwark publisher Sarah Longwell calling the Trump administration a \" mob boss government. \" New York University law professor Michael Kasdan called the agreement \" unethical shakedown bulls--- .\" Former Bloomberg editorial writer Robert A. George derided the deal as \"Literally a LEGAL (services) shakedown.\" And former Obama administration assistant press secretary Patrick Rodenbush tweeted that the message the deal sent was \"bleak.\"\n\n\"Caving into pressure will only embolden future punishment,\" he wrote. \"What's the purpose of law firms, universities, et al building wealth and power if they're not willing to use it to fight govt intrusion?\"\n\n\"Two things are true,\" attorney Andrew Fleischman tweeted in response to the Paul Weiss agreement. \"1. The law firm absolutely had to do this to ensure its own survival and 2. it was absolutely the product of a transparently corrupt and unconstitutional shakedown.\""

      "text": "The duty to impeach Mad King Donald\n\nDonald Trump\n\nMembers of Congress take an oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\" Everything following \"support\"-the part about defending the Constitution \"against all enemies, foreign and domestic\"-was added during the Civil War. And Donald Trump is exactly what they were talking about: an enemy of the Constitution who seeks to set himself up as a virtual king, above the law and accountable to no one. Their oaths make it clear that members of Congress have a sworn duty to protect the Constitution from him, and \"Impeachment is a remedy for a runaway president,\" as Texas Representative Al Green told Democracy Now! On March 7.\n\nIn 2017, Green was the first congress member to call for Trump's impeachment and he's working to do it again.\n\n\"I believe that he has done things that would merit impeachment,\" Green said, noting that \"If we wanted to impeach a president for speaking ill of Congress, as the president did, we can do it,\" since that happened in 1868. Impeachment, Green said, \"is what Gerald Ford said when he was in the House: whatever a given Congress concludes that it is on a given time - at a given time.\"\n\nThe next week, on March 12, constitutional attorney John Bonifaz told Democracy Now! about a grassroots impeachment campaign that's already gained more than a quarter million signatures. \"This president has already committed multiple abuses of power since assuming the presidency,\" Bonifaz said. \"And the framers designed the Constitution to ensure that we would not have a monarch or a tyrant govern this nation.\"\n\nThe petition can be found at impeachtrumpagain.org , which explains:\n\nCongress should have opened an impeachment investigation into Trump's violations of the Emoluments Clauses and into his unlawful, corrupt campaign practices on Day 1 of Trump's second administration. Since taking office, Trump has committed a growing list of impeachable offenses.\n\nIt goes on to present a list of 13 specific charges that Congress should investigate, many with further specific subpoints. While all are serious, five of them are most closely tied to Trump's attempt to set himself up as a would-be absolute monarch, undermining any countervailing power:\n\nCuriously missing from this list was Trump's efforts to intimidate, if not jail or silence critical voices in the press, an oversight that Trump himself underscored two days later when he illegally delivered a political speech at the Department of Justice, where he called CNN, MSNBC, and unspecified newspapers illegal, signally his intention to silence, if not imprison, his critics. \"They're really corrupt and they're illegal. What they do is illegal,\" he said of the cable channels, adding, \"These networks and these newspapers are really no different than a highly paid political operative. And it has to stop. It has to be illegal.\"\n\nWhile all the above reflect Trump's dictatorial ambitions that Congress has a duty to defend against, they don't exhaust the list of his impeachable conduct. Other specific charges from impeachtrumpagain.org include:\n\nBut even these do not exhaust the list. Trump's sweeping efforts to wantonly slash the federal government aren't just a violation of Congress's power of the purse, they're also a profound injury to the American people, in violation of the Constitution's preamble: that it was established to \"promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense.\"\n\nGreen appeared on Democracy Now! the day after the House censured him for daring to challenge Trump during his address to Congress, saying Trump had \"no mandate to cut Medicaid!\" But Trump is going much further than cutting Medicaid-he's going after Social Security and Medicare, which are bedrocks in promoting the general welfare, in addition to numerous other injuries to the general welfare, such as defunding biomedical research, shutting down national parks, slashing the National Weather Service, and much more.\n\nTrump's attacks on Social Security are being led by unelected co-president Elon Musk, whose false claims of massive fraud (a 10,000% exaggeration) have already justified terminating payments to recipients, while an internal memo obtained by Popular Information, lays out a plan to sabotage the agency, simultaneously slashing staff and closing offices, while forcing hundreds of thousands if not millions of beneficiaries to go to extraordinary lengths to secure the benefits they're entitled to.\n\nThe endgame-shared by rightwing ideologues for generations-is to make the system so dysfunctional that people will agree to privatize it, resulting in billions, if not trillions of dollars being transferred from people who paid into the system into the pockets of Wall Street billionaire oligarchs-if not Musk himself, as he expands his financial interests. Such a wealth transfer is the exact opposite of promoting the general welfare-a direct violation of the Constitution's preamble.\n\nBut there's another way in which Trump's actions are impeachable: as violations of the Constitution's \"Take Care\" clause. Article II, Section 3 states that, among other things, the President \"shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" This is exactly the opposite of what Trump has done. He's sought to turn the laws inside out to serve his own narrow interests, and those of close allies like Musk, who's seen dozens of investigations into his businesses shut down since Trump's inauguration.\n\nIn Trump's first term, it took a long time for Green to build support for impeachment, until Trump blatantly crossed the line, withholding congressionally appropriated funds in an attempt to blackmail Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy into opening a phony investigation into Joe Biden. This term, Trump began similar efforts almost immediately. Impounding Congressionally-approved funds have garnered the most attention by far, thanks to Musk's chainsaw approach. But Trump is also blackmailing Zelenskyy with a different end in mind: Rewarding his Russian handler, Vladimir Putin, for his murderous invasion of Ukraine. And in the wake of his recent DOJ speech, he's made clear his intention to continue phony investigations against Biden and those Trump sees as aligned with him.\n\nOn social media Trump said he no longer considered valid the pardons Biden granted to people Trump might target because they were signed using an autopen, which is not merely an uncontroversial method of affixing a presidential signature that Trump himself has used, it's the modern version of a device first used and praised by Thomas Jefferson.\n\nAll this shows that Trump is completely undeterred from the kind of conduct he was impeached for in his first term-conduct that culminated with an armed attack on the Capitol, a failed coup. It's clear that such conduct warrants impeachment again. \"But what's the point?\" you might ask, given how little effect it had last time.\n\nThe answer lies in the streets, rather than in Congress or the Courts. As Abraham Lincoln famously said, \"Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it, nothing can succeed.\" Recent research has shown that nonviolent protest movements almost inevitably drive autocrats from power once they reach a threshold of 3.5% of the population. That's what a study of 323 violent and nonviolent movements from 1900 to 2006 showed, described in the 2011 book, \"Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict\" by Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan. \"There weren't any campaigns that had failed after they had achieved 3.5% participation during a peak event,\" Chenoweth told the BBC in 2019.\n\nAs Rachel Maddow noted on her March 17 show, such movements are now surging in response to the autocratic wave that Trump is a part of. Other countries, like Hungary and Syria, are well ahead of us because their autocrats have been in power much longer. But protests here in America are mushrooming at an astonishing speed, in a wide variety of venues for a wide variety of specific causes. Adding the broad call for Trump's impeachment to the specifics of each local protest is a logical way for Americans to do what others have done before them to get rid of autocratic authoritarian leaders. Congress has a duty to impeach Trump. And the people have the power to make that happen. It may not be clear from American history. But world history holds out more promise.\n\nNOW READ: What's behind Trump's attack on the American mind?"

While Biden championed NATO's expansion and viewed participation in the alliance as crucial to the United States from a national security/foreign policy standpoint, Trump is a vehement critic of NATO.\n\nIn Trump's view, NATO takes a lot more from the U.S. than it gives in return. And according to NBC News sources in the U.S. Department of Defense , the Trump-era Pentagon (led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth) is considering giving up the United States' longtime role as supreme commander of NATO in Europe.\n\nRetired Adm. James Stavridis, former NATO supreme allied commander, is vehemently opposed to that idea. And he isn't the only military expert who feels that way.\n\nThe Hill's Alexander Bolton, in an article published on March 21 , reports that Trump is \"on a collision course with Republican defense hawks over the question of whether the United States should continue its 75-year military leadership of NATO and at what level of commitment.\"\n\n\"Withdrawing from NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe command structure would signal diminished U.S. involvement in NATO and could eventually spell the end of the alliance as it has been known for 75 years,\" Bolton explains . \"It would be politically difficult to place U.S. armed forces under the command of a European ally when United States defense spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of all NATO countries' combined defense spending.\"\n\nIn a joint statement released on March 19 , Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi) and House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers (R-Alabama), declared, \"We will not accept significant changes to our warfighting structure that are made without a rigorous interagency process, coordination with combatant commanders and the Joint Staff, and collaboration with Congress.\"\n\nThe following day, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) - former GOP leader in the U.S. Senate - issued a statement saying, \"Weakening American leadership won't strengthen NATO or U.S. interests. If we're serious about encouraging more capable European allies, retreating from our position as the leader of the trans-Atlantic alliance would be an odd way to show it.\"\n\nDanielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute is speaking out as well.\n\nPletka told The Hill , \"Congress absolutely has a say in the structure of our command. Congress absolutely has a say in how we resource our defense and our alliances. If the Pentagon isn't keeping these really important Republican members in the loop, that's a major problem.\"\n\nRead The Hill's full article at this link ."

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nAs President Donald Trump's executive actions continue to get shot down by federal judges, he's since retaliated by stoking calls for impeachment. Now, some former federal judges are condemning his rhetoric.\n\nPolitico reported Thursday that the threats from the Trump administration have now prompted multiple veteran jurists to speak out against his push to impeach judges who have struck down his policies. This week, Trump and his biggest supporters have railed against both U.S. District Judge James Boasberg - who ordered two deportation flights be turned around in response to Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 - and Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who publicly rebuked Trump over his call to impeach Boasberg.\n\nNancy Gernter, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, said Trump's impeachment threats are \"nothing short of horrifying.\"\n\n\"The distance between what we impeach for and what he's accusing these judges for is enormous ... It's preposterous,\" Gertner said. \"He could have done all of these cases normally and, you know, respectfully, and is likely to have won in some cases, but he doesn't want to do it that way. He wants to prove his power. And that's the frightening part.\"\n\nEven one sitting federal judge - who Politico quoted anonymously - slammed the administration over its attacks on the judiciary. The jurist remarked that Trump's approach was counterproductive, as he'll ultimately need judges to sign off on the legality of his policies if he aims for them to stand.\n\n\"It's a really bizarre way to do business. If he thinks he can intimidate judges, it's not going to be a successful strategy,\" the unnamed judge said. \"It's not the way to win cases ... Maybe it will appeal to the public, maybe from a public relations perspective, but it's not a great strategy for the judges that I know.\"\n\nAside from Boasberg's ruling on this week's deportation flights, Trump has also complained about judges who have stymied his attempts to eradicate birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, compelled him to disburse federal funds his administration froze despite Congress already appropriating the money and orders preventing representatives of billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive payment systems at the U.S. Treasury Department."

But they're small majorities.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate, Republicans have a 53-47 majority - which is large enough to get Trump's most controversial nominees confirmed, but not enough to overcome the 60-vote demand of the filibuster. Nor is it enough to get a \"guilty\" vote in an impeachment.\n\nTrump and some of his allies, including billionaire Tesla/SpaceX/X.com leader Elon Musk, are calling for the impeachment of federal judges who are blocking, at least temporarily, some of the president's executive orders. But if federal judges were to be indicted on articles on impeachment in the U.S. House of Representatives, Republicans wouldn't have enough votes for a \"guilty\" verdict in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAccording to Politico reporters Meredith Lee Hill, Hailey Fuchs and Jordain Carney , however, GOP lawmakers are thinking about ways to attack federal judges other than impeachment.\n\n\"Top Republicans are likely to put at least one bill, California Rep. Darrell Issa's 'No Rogue Rulings Act,' on the floor in early April, according to two people granted anonymity to discuss scheduling plans,\" the journalists explain in an article published on March 21 . \"The legislation would crack down on the ability of lower-court judges to issue far-reaching injunctions. That is seen by Speaker Mike Johnson and other House Republican leaders as a viable outlet as they sort out the way forward on the judicial impeachments that have been endorsed by Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk. A spokesperson for Johnson said the speaker and the Judiciary Committee are reviewing 'all available options.... to address this urgent matter.'\"\n\nHill, Fuchs and Carney continued , \"House Republicans have filed impeachment resolutions targeting four district judges, including one this week targeting the jurist who sought to block Trump's effort to deport alleged gang members to El Salvador.... But there is widespread recognition inside the House GOP that impeachments - besides being costly in time and political capital - do not have the votes to succeed given Republicans' narrow majority. That has prompted GOP hardliners to back-channel with Trump allies on alternatives they could push across the House floor.\"\n\nHouse Republicans, according to the Politico journalists , \"are also discussing one-off resolutions condemning recent judicial rulings against Trump.\"\n\n\"House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan's team has privately advised that members' offices are free to share their opinions on legislative strategy around the courts but that Jordan himself intends to stick to a more vague approach, saying everything is on the table, according to one Republican Hill aide,\" Hill, Fuchs and Carney explain . \"There is, however, a particular interest in restricting the authority of federal district judges to hand down nationwide injunctions, according to four Republicans familiar with the matter.\"\n\nRead the full Politico article at this link ."

But according to The New Republic's Malcolm Ferguson , that is yet another thing that could help tank the economy.\n\n\"Repealing the Inflation Reduction Act - something President Trump is currently trying very hard to do - could result in a $160 billion hit to the gross domestic product, according to Semafor ,\" Ferguson explains. \"A complete IRA repeal would devastate the country's economy. It could lead to 790,000 lost job losses by 2030, while household energy bills would reach $370 per year, on average, by 2035.\"\n\nFerguson adds , \"This is ominous news for an economy already on the brink of recession.\"\n\nFerguson warns that economic damage from tariffs and economic damage from a repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act could be a painful combination.\n\n\"That recession is being driven by Trump's ongoing trade war with America's closest allies - 25 percent levies are currently being placed on many imports from Mexico and Canada - which Fed Chair Jerome Powell just admitted was making inflation worse,\" Ferguson notes . \"Cuts to the IRA would have a massive negative impact on American manufacturing, delivering a devastating blow to a sector that those tariffs are theoretically intended to boost. Slashing the IRA would also particularly harm red states, which have received a whopping 77 percent of clean energy manufacturing and deployment investment since the third quarter of 2022.\"\n\nFerguson continues , \"A full repeal of the IRA is not expected, of course, but Speaker Mike Johnson did describe his vision for the cuts as 'somewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.' Even if the bill is not repealed - or curtailed - by Congress, agency cuts made by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have likely already affected its implementation.\"\n\nAccording to Semafor's Mizy Clifton , red states and swing states could suffer the most damage from a repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nClifton, in an article also published on March 20 , reports, \"With the exception of California, Republican-controlled states - Texas, Georgia, Florida, and Pennsylvania - stand out as the biggest losers, according to projections by think tank Energy Innovation: Annual household energy bills in Texas, for example, could increase $370 per year on average in 2035 as reduced investment in renewables drives up the share of electricity coming from fossil fuels and utilities pass on their higher costs to consumers, according to Energy Innovation projections.\"\n\nRead The New Republic's full article at this link and Semafor's reporting here ."

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\n\nPresident Donald Trump's order calling for the dismantling of the U.S. Education Department has complex implications.\n\nThe Republican president has argued the federal office hasn't improved student outcomes and is unnecessary in a country where states and local districts primarily control education from funding to hiring and curriculum.\n\nFor decades, right-wing activists have called for eliminating the agency, which was created by Congress in 1979. As Trump remakes the federal government, he has assailed the department as wasteful and responsible for spreading \"woke\" ideas such as programs to support diversity, equity and inclusion and protections for transgender students.\n\nThe department has been largely responsible for oversight, enforcing discrimination laws and distributing aid money for schools with low-income students and students with disabilities. Federal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets, roughly 14%.\n\nIn the short term, students, teachers and parents likely won't see much impact. Long term, it's harder to predict.\n\nIt depends how Education Secretary Linda McMahon distributes the mandated functions of the department to other parts of government, including the states.\n\nThe biggest question is how the states will distribute the federal money the department sends to help educate students who are poor, disabled or still learning English and need extra support. School systems with weak property tax bases, including those in rural areas, depend on that money to pay teachers, pay for buses and buy classroom technology.\n\nStates such as Mississippi and Alaska depend on this money to fund more than 20% of school districts' costs. Advocates worry that without federal oversight , state leaders could spend the money on anything they want, including vouchers to attend private school.\n\nCuts the Trump administration has made already to the Education Department have eliminated hundreds of staff members and contracts dedicated to maintaining the Free Application for Student Aid, or FAFSA, website and helping users navigate the complicated form. But McMahon has said the federal programs will be maintained.\n\nOn Friday, Trump said the Small Business Administration would take over the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio. Conservatives, including former Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, have talked about setting up a quasi-private bank to administer loans.\n\nUsers should expect some hiccups. The StudentAid.gov website was down for several hours last week as the remaining department staff tried to troubleshoot an outage.\n\nSchool meal programs are funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture so they are not affected by Trump's move to eliminate the Education Department. However, the USDA has cut a $1 billion coronavirus pandemic-era measure that helped schools and food banks to buy local farm-fresh food.\n\nStates and other organizations are vowing to bring lawsuits to halt the dismantling of the department, which could slow things down.\n\nEliminating the department entirely would require an act of Congress. Republicans in Congress are planning legislation to eliminate the agency, but they face heavy opposition from Democrats.\n\nIn the meantime, Trump still has plans for the department. Even as he ordered its closure, Trump has tasked the department with rooting out and punishing schools that have diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(Don Campbell/The Herald-Palladium via AP)\n\n▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday calling for the dismantling of the U.S. Education Department , advancing a campaign promise to take apart an agency that's been a longtime target of conservatives.\n\nTrump has derided the Education Department as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology. However, completing its dismantling is most likely impossible without an act of Congress, which created the department in 1979. Republicans said they will introduce legislation to achieve that, while Democrats have quickly lined up to oppose the idea.\n\nThe order says the education secretary will, \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities.\"\n\nIt offers no detail on how that work will be carried out or where it will be targeted, though the White House said the agency will retain certain critical functions.\n\nTrump said his administration will close the department beyond its \"core necessities,\" preserving its responsibilities for Title I funding for low-income schools, Pell grants and money for children with disabilities.\n\nThe White House said earlier Thursday the department will continue to manage federal student loans, but the order appears to say the opposite. It says the Education Department doesn't have the staff to oversee its $1.6 trillion loan portfolio and \"must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America's students.\"\n\nAt a signing ceremony, Trump blamed the department for America's lagging academic performance and said states will do a better job.\n\n\"It's doing us no good,\" he said.\n\nAlready, Trump's Republican administration has been gutting the agency. Its workforce is being slashed in half , and there have been deep cuts to the Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation's academic progress.\n\nAP correspondent Ben Thomas reports President Trump is moving to shut down the Education Department.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon arrives before President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon said she will remove red tape and empower states to decide what's best for their schools. But she promised to continue essential services and work with states and Congress \"to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"\n\nPart of her job will be exploring which agencies can take on the Education Department's various roles, she said.\n\n\"The Department of Justice already has a civil rights office, and I think that there is an opportunity to discuss with Attorney General Bondi about locating some of our civil rights work there,\" McMahon told reporters after the signing.\n\nThe measure was celebrated by groups that have long called for an end to the department.\n\n\"For decades, it has funneled billions of taxpayer dollars into a failing system - one that prioritizes leftist indoctrination over academic excellence, all while student achievement stagnates and America falls further behind,\" said Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation.\n\nAdvocates for public schools said eliminating the department would leave children behind in a fundamentally unequal education system.\n\n\"This is a dark day for the millions of American children who depend on federal funding for a quality education, including those in poor and rural communities with parents who voted for Trump,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson said.\n\nOpponents are already gearing up for legal challenges, including Democracy Forward, a public interest litigation group. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the order a \"tyrannical power grab\" and \"one of the most destructive and devastating steps Donald Trump has ever taken.\"\n\nMargaret Spellings, who served as education secretary under Republican President George W. Bush, questioned whether whether the department will be able to accomplish its remaining missions, and whether it will ultimately improve schools.\n\n\"Will it distract us from the ability to focus urgently on student achievement, or will people be figuring out how to run the train?\" she asked.\n\nSpellings said schools have always been run by local and state officials, and rejected the idea that the Education Department and federal government have been holding them back.\n\nCurrently, much of the agency's work revolves around managing money - both its extensive student loan portfolio and a range of aid programs for colleges and school districts, like school meals and support for homeless students. The agency also is key in overseeing civil rights enforcement .\n\nThe Trump administration has not addressed the fate of other department operations, like its support for for technical education and adult learning, grants for rural schools and after-school programs, and a federal work-study program that provides employment to students with financial need.\n\nStates and districts already control local schools, including curriculum, but some conservatives have pushed to cut strings attached to federal money and provide it to states as \"block grants\" to be used at their discretion.\n\nBlock granting has raised questions about vital funding sources including Title I, the largest source of federal money to America's K-12 schools. Families of children with disabilities have despaired over what could come of the federal department's work protecting their rights.\n\nFederal funding makes up a relatively small portion of public school budgets - roughly 14%. The money often supports supplemental programs for vulnerable students, such as the McKinney-Vento program for homeless students or Title I for low-income schools.\n\nProtestors gather during a demonstration at the headquarters of the Department of Education, Friday, March 14, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nRepublicans have talked about closing the Education Department for decades, saying it wastes money and inserts the federal government into decisions that should fall to states and schools. The idea has gained popularity recently as conservative parents' groups demand more authority over their children's schooling.\n\nIn his platform, Trump promised to close the department \"and send it back to the states, where it belongs.\" Trump has cast the department as a hotbed of \"radicals, zealots and Marxists\" who overextend their reach through guidance and regulation.\n\nEven as Trump moves to dismantle the department, he has leaned on it to promote elements of his agenda. He has used investigative powers of the Office for Civil Rights and the threat of withdrawing federal education money to target schools and colleges that run afoul of his orders on transgender athletes participating in women's sports , pro-Palestinian activism and diversity programs.\n\nSen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, dismissed Trump's claim that he's returning education to the states. She said he is actually \"trying to exert ever more control over local schools and dictate what they can and cannot teach.\"\n\nEven some of Trump's allies have questioned his power to close the agency without action from Congress, and there are doubts about its political popularity. The House considered an amendment to close the agency in 2023, but 60 Republicans joined Democrats in opposing it.\n\n___ Associated Press writer Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

See what you missed below.\n\nA federal judge said Friday he will \"get to the bottom\" of whether President Donald Trump's administration defied his order blocking deportation flights .\n\nChief Judge James Boasberg is examining the administration's use of an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador . He's trying to determine if the government ignored his turnaround order last weekend when at least two planeloads of immigrants were still in flight.\n\nOther news we're following today:\n\nA group of reporters and unions are suing the Trump administration. They say it unlawfully shut down the Voice of America and are asking a federal court to restore the outlet that for decades has supplied news about the United States to nations around the world.\n\nThe case was filed in federal court in New York. It was brought by Voice of America reporters, Reporters Without Borders and a handful of unions against the U.S. Agency for Global Media and Kari Lake, who is Trump's representative there.\n\nShe has described the broadcast agency as a \"giant rot\" that needs to be stripped down and rebuilt.\n\nVoice of America dates to World War II as a source of objective news , often beamed into authoritarian countries. Funded by Congress, it is protected by a charter that says guarantees its product pass muster for journalistic rigor.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is making cuts to three key offices that oversee civil rights protections across its broad mission, suggesting that they were impeding immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nA spokeswoman for the department, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement Friday that it was implementing a \"reduction in force\" for three offices: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, and the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman.\n\nMcLaughlin said Homeland Security is \"committed to civil rights protections\" but said, \"These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS's mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.\"\n\n▶ Read more about the Department of Homeland Security's cuts\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security says it will revoke legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, setting them up for potential deportation in about a month.\n\nThe order applies to about 532,000 people from the four countries who came to the United States since October 2022. They arrived with financial sponsors and were given two-year permits to live and work in the U.S.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says they will lose their legal status April 24, or 30 days after the publication of the notice in the Federal Register.\n\n▶ Read more about the status revocations\n\nFollowing Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' rejection of a call to impeach federal judges who rule against the Trump administration, social media users falsely claimed that Roberts and other high-level legal professionals are part of a \"secretive, invite-only club\" trying to undermine the president.\n\nAmong those named was U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who Trump had demanded be removed from the bench for his order blocking deportation flights.\n\nHere's a closer look at the facts:\n\nCLAIM: Roberts, Boasberg and other powerful legal professionals are part of a secret, invite-only club that is working against Trump.\n\nTHE FACTS: This is false. Roberts was a member of the Edward Coke Appellate Inn of Court chapter of the organization prior to his confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2005, but he is not currently an active member of the organization, according to Executive Director Malinda Dunn.\n\nBoasberg is the president of the Edward Bennett Williams Inn of Court, but the chapter disaffiliated from the parent association about 10 years ago.\n\n▶ Read more about the claims versus the facts\n\nChildren cover their heads as they sit outside of a migrant shelter Wednesday, March 13, 2024, in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago.

The researchers also say they were told to remove the words \"gender,\" \"cisgender\" and \"equitable.\"\n\nThe reason given for the changes was to comply with an executive order from Trump.\n\nResearchers Tamar Antin and Rachelle Annechino said Friday in a blog post they withdrew their paper from Public Health Reports, the official journal of the U.S. Surgeon General.\n\nThe researchers plan to publish their findings elsewhere, Antin told The Associated Press.\n\n▶ Read more about the publication's instructions\n\nThis will be the first weekend he's spent at his Bedminster golf club since becoming president for the second time. He has spent the bulk of his weekends at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\n\nTrump told reporters he was on his way to New Jersey to do \"work,\" then previewed his plans to visit the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia this weekend.\n\n\"I've always supported the wrestlers,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president added that after the championships he would either return to Washington or to the \"southern White House\" - a reference to his Palm Beach club, although Florida had not been listed among weekend plans.\n\nHoward Lutnick, President Donald Trump's choice to be Secretary of Commerce, appears for his confirmation hearing, Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

The European tariffs would target US steel and aluminum products, but also American beef, poultry, bourbon, motorcycles, peanut butter and jeans.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that by delaying phase 1, the commission's goal is \"to get the balance of products right, reflecting the interests of our producers, our exporters, our consumers, and of course, minimize the potential negative impact on our economy.\"\n\n▶ Read more about the EU's tariff plans\n\nThe State Department has banned former Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, her planning minister Julio Miguel De Vido and their families from entering the United States, accusing them of involvement in \"significant corruption\" while they were in office.\n\nKirchner and De Vido \"abused their positions by orchestrating and financially benefiting from multiple bribery schemes involving public works contracts, resulting in millions of dollars stolen from the Argentine government,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement released on Friday.\n\nHe noted that multiple courts had convicted the pair on corruption charges.\n\n\"The United States will continue to promote accountability for those who abuse public power for personal gain,\" Rubio said. \"These designations reaffirm our commitment to counter global corruption, including at the highest levels of government.\"\n\nA person walks by the Johnson & Johnson headquarters is in New Brunswick, N.J., on Thursday, Feb. 8, 2024.

We're not certain that DOGE has taken over, but we do know that President Trump has named a new acting director for the Institute of Museum and Library Services . We also know that it's one of the seven independent government agencies cited in a recent executive order calling for their dismantling \"to the maximum extent of the law.\"\n\nTrump said that the order \"continues the reduction in the elements of the Federal bureaucracy that the President has determined are unnecessary.\"\n\nAP reporter Hillel Italie did a deep dive on what this means for the institute. Here's some of his reporting:\n\nSince taking office, Trump has shuttered or drastically curtailed agencies, including the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development. The Institute of Museum and Library of Services, or IMLS, is a key source of funding for museums, libraries and educational institutions.\n\nThe library association has advised members that the status of current grants remains unclear. If the administration follows the same playbook it has in targeting other small agencies for closure, IMLS could be shut down.\n\nThe Texas Republican was pressed Friday during a town hall in his district to see about getting jobs back for veterans laid off amid wide-ranging federal job cuts.\n\n\"Just because you're a veteran doesn't mean you're good at it,\" said Crenshaw, a former Navy Seal. \"But if you're doing a job that we need you to do, and you're doing it well, we've got to fight for you.\"\n\nAccording to an internal memo obtained earlier this month by The Associated Press, the Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to cut more than 80,000 jobs from the sprawling agency that provides health care and other services for millions of veterans .\n\nNASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore spent 278 extra days on the International Space Station after their spacecraft malfunctioned, but aren't eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBut the president says not to worry - he'll make them square for their lost time in space.\n\n\"If I have to, I'll pay it out of my own pocket,\" the billionaire real estate developer told reporters.\n\nNASA astronauts Suni Williams, left, and Butch Wilmore stand together for a photo enroute to the launch pad at Space Launch Complex 41 Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in Cape Canaveral, Fla., for their liftoff to the International Space Station.

His executive order pushing for the dismantling of the Education Department meets a longtime Republican goal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump steps off Air Force One after arriving at Andrews Air Force Base, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019, in Andrews Air Force Base, Md.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"\n\nBut critics have questioned the cost and necessity of the program.

Gus Bilirakis defended DOGE's efforts to fire federal workers and dismantle federal agencies, saying the push has faced a \"gross overreaction in the media.\"\n\n\"It looks radical, but it's not. I call it stewardship, in my opinion,\" the Republican said. \"I think they're doing right by the American taxpayer.\"\n\nBilirakis sought to calm the older adults and veterans who complained about efforts to slash even the agencies that have bipartisan support.\n\n\"Elon Musk will not touch Social Security,\" he said.\n\nMusk has described Social Security and other federal benefit programs as rife with fraud, suggesting they'll be a primary target in his crusade to reduce government spending.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson warned them against facing protesters, but GOP Reps. Celeste Maloy and Mike Kennedy of Utah did so anyway in liberal Salt Lake City, and got earfuls from the boisterous audience.\n\nMany urged Maloy to denounce Trump's sweeping federal budget cuts, but she said getting the country out of its financial situation will require \"all of us feeling some pain.\"\n\nTo jeers from the crowd Thursday, Kennedy defended Trump's actions. Many questions focused on how federal cuts might impact Utah's vast public lands.

Many scrambled to distance themselves from The PhD Project, which has aimed to help diversify the business world and higher education faculty.\n\nThe rollout of the investigations highlights the climate of fear and uncertainty in higher education, which President Donald Trump's administration has begun policing for policies that run afoul of his agenda even as he moves to dismantle the Education Department .\n\n▶ Read more about colleges distancing themselves from the PhD Project\n\nTrump has derided the Education Department as wasteful and polluted by liberal ideology.

Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the Democratic response following Trump's speech, allowed that \"America wants change, but there's a responsible way to make change and a reckless way, and we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country and as a democracy.\"\n\nEmboldened after overcoming impeachments in his first term, outlasting criminal prosecutions in between his two administrations and getting a tight grip on the GOP-led Congress, Trump has embarked on a mission to dismantle parts of the federal government , remake the relationship with America's allies and slap on tariffs that have sparked a North American trade war.\n\n\"It has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action,\" Trump said of his opening weeks in office. \"The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it.\"\n\nTrump, who has billionaire adviser Elon Musk orchestrating his efforts to slash the size and scope of the federal government, said he is working to \"reclaim democracy from this unaccountable bureaucracy\" and threatened federal workers anew with firings if they resist his agenda.\n\nElon Musk stands and is recognized and applauded as President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nMusk, who was seated in the House gallery, received a pair of standing ovations from Republicans in the chamber, as Trump exaggerated and shared false claims about alleged government abuse uncovered by the Tesla and SpaceX founder and his team of disrupters.\n\nTrump repeated false claims that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments, prompting some Democrats to shout, \"Not true!\" and \"Those are lies!\"\n\nTrump spoke at a critical juncture in his presidency, as voters who returned him to the White House on his promise to fix inflation are instead finding economic chaos. All the gains the S&P 500 have made since Election Day are now gone , while consumer sentiment surveys show the public sees inflation as worsening.\n\nTrump seemed prepared to double down on his trade policies, which experts have warned will raise prices for consumers.\n\n\"Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them,\" Trump said. At the same time, he tried to ease concerns about the resulting price increases, saying, \"There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much.\"\n\nTrump said one of his \"very highest priorities\" was to rescue the economy and offer relief to working families. He promised to organize the federal government to lower costs on eggs and energy, blaming his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden for the situation and offering scant details of his own plans.\n\nTrump also called for the extension of his first-term tax cuts and additional federal funding for his border crackdown, including for his promised efforts at \"mass deportation\" of people in the U.S. illegally.\n\nHe celebrated his crackdown on migration, saying, \"But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.\"\n\nSpeaking about his promised tax cuts, Trump seemed to goad Democrats, saying: \"I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts. Because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office.\"\n\nThe backdrop was the new economic uncertainty unleashed after the president opened the day by placing stiff tariffs on imports from the country's neighbors and closest trading partners. A 25% tax on goods from Canada and Mexico went into effect early Tuesday - ostensibly to secure greater cooperation to tackle fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration - triggering immediate retaliation and sparking fears of a wider trade war. Trump also raised tariffs on goods from China to 20%.\n\nRepublican members of Congress applaud as President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025.

The GOP lawmakers were jubilant, having won a trifecta of the White House, Senate and House in the elections. However, they face the challenging task of delivering on Trump's agenda as well as avoiding a government shutdown later this month.\n\nAcross the aisle, out-of-power Democrats set the tone early, with most remaining seated without applauding or making eye contact with Trump as he was introduced in the chamber.\n\nAfter several interruptions, House Speaker Mike Johnson jumped in and called for decorum to be restored in the chamber as Republicans shouted \"USA\" to drown out the cries from the other side of the aisle. Johnson then ordered Texas Rep. Al Green removed from the chamber.\n\n\"It's worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up\" to Trump, Green told reporters after being thrown out of the chamber.\n\nRep.

(Win McNamee/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nOther Democrats held up signs criticizing like \"Save Medicaid\" and \"Protect Veterans\" during Trump's remarks, seeking to drive public awareness to elements of Trump's agenda they believed might offer them a pathway back to the majority.\n\nSome Democrats chose to highlight the impact of Trump's actions by inviting fired federal workers as guests, including a disabled veteran from Arizona, a health worker from Maryland and a forestry employee who worked on wildfire prevention in California.\n\nTrump also used his speech to address his proposals for fostering peace in Ukraine and the Middle East, where he has unceremoniously upended the policies of the Biden administration in a matter of just weeks. On Monday, Trump ordered a freeze to U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, ending years of staunch American support for the country in fending off Russia's invasion.\n\nTrump recited a letter he received earlier Tuesday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that the wartime president wants to come back to the table after a explosive Oval Office meeting last week broke down negotiations for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. \"We've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace,\" Trump said. \"Wouldn't that be beautiful?\"\n\nHe also announced the arrest of a suspect in the 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed U.S. troops during the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nTrump's 1 hour and 39 minute speech was the longest annual address a president has ever delivered to Congress, breaking Bill Clinton's record of 1 hour and 28 minutes.\n\nWatching from the gallery with first lady Melania Trump were guests including 15-year-old Elliston Berry, of Aledo, Texas, who was the victim of an explicit deepfake image sent to classmates.\n\nOther White House guests included relatives of Corey Comperatore, the former Pennsylvania fire chief who was killed as he protected his family during an assassination attempt on Trump last summer.\n\nRepublican lawmakers cheered the conclusion of Trump's address with chants that echoed his words after he was struck in the ear by a bullet: \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Mascaro, Stephen Groves and Kevin Freking in Washington, Darlene Superville in Kissimmee, Fla., and Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.\n\nTrucks line up to cross the border into the United States as tariffs against Mexico go into effect, Tuesday, March 4, 2025, in Tijuana, Mexico. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\nBeijing retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.\n\nIn an address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump repeated two different explanations for his tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He cited the trade deficits the U.S. has with both countries, but also said, \"they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\"\n\nTrump also acknowledged there could be \"a little disturbance\" from the tariffs, a possible nod to the stock market's sharp falls in the past two days as well as concerns about inflation.\n\n\"It may be a little bit of an adjustment period,\" he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. \"You have to bear with me again and this will be even better.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days.\n\n\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" Trudeau said.\n\nPresident Trump imposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday and doubled tariffs against imports from China. Here's what you need to know about them.\n\nLater in the day, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would likely meet Canada and Mexico \"in the middle,\" with an announcement coming as soon as Wednesday.\n\nLutnick told Fox Business Network that the tariffs would not be paused, but that Trump would reach a compromise.\n\n\"I think he's going to figure out, you do more, and I'll meet you in the middle in some way,\" Lutnick said.\n\nA Canadian senior government official said Lutnick called Ontario Premier Doug Ford after Ford's press conference and asked him to stand down. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call, said Ford told the U.S. commerce secretary he'll go harder.\n\nThe official said Lutnick told Ford that Trudeau's \"very dumb\" comment and remarks by other Canadian officials were not helpful, but said Lutnick seemed to acknowledge the tariffs are a part of negotiation toward a trade deal.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a news conference on imposed U.S. tariffs as Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly, Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Public Safety Minister David McGuinty look on in Ottawa on Tuesday, March 4, 2025.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond to the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump's trade war.\n\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's blistering rejection of the Trump tariffs.\n\nChina indicated on Tuesday night that it would not back down.\n\n\"If war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we're ready to fight till the end,\" China's embassy to the United States posted on X.\n\nThe president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II. He argues that open trade cost America millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to national prosperity. He rejects the views of mainstream economists who contend that such protectionism is costly and inefficient.\n\nImport taxes are \"a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,\" Trump said Monday. \"And now we're using them.\"\n\nDartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin, author of a 2017 history of U.S. tariff policy, has calculated that Tuesday's hikes will lift America's average tariff from 2.4% to 10.5%, the highest level since the 1940s. \"We're in a new era for sure.\"\n\nAs the trade disputes escalated, stocks racked up more losses Tuesday on Wall Street, wiping out all the gains since Election Day for the S&P 500. Markets in Europe also fell sharply.\n\nThe American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he will do next.\n\nA truck drives past the passenger entry point at the United States and Canada border in Surrey B.C., on Tuesday, March 4, 2025. (Ethan Cairns /The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nDuring his first term, Trump imposed tariffs only after lengthy investigations - into the national security implications of relying on foreign steel, for example, said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm.\n\nBut by declaring a national emergency involving the flow of immigrants and illicit drugs across U.S. borders, \"he can modify these tariffs with a stroke of the pen,'' House said. \"It's chaotic.\"\n\nDemocratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs.\n\n\"Presidents don't get to invent emergencies to justify bad policies,\" said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"Abusing emergency powers to wage an economic war on our closest allies isn't leadership - it's dangerous.\"\n\nEven some Republican senators raised alarms. \"Maine and Canada's economy are integrated,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, explaining that much of the state's lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S.\n\nTruck driver Carlos Ponce, 58, went about business as usual Tuesday morning, transporting auto parts from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, just as he's done for decades.\n\nLike many on the border, he was worried about the fallout from the tariffs. \"Things could change drastically,\" Ponce said. Truckers could lose their jobs or have to drive farther to coastal ports as Mexican manufacturers look for trading partners beyond the U.S.\n\nAlan Russell, head of Tecma, which helps factories set up in places like Ciudad Juarez, is skeptical that Trump's tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the United States.\n\n\"Nobody is going to move their factory until they have certainty,\" Russell said. Just last week, he said, Tecma helped a North Carolina manufacturer that moved to Mexico because it couldn't find enough workers in the United States.\n\nThe flags of Mexico, Canada and the United States are shown near the Ambassador Bridge, Monday, Feb. 3, 2025, in Detroit. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)\n\nU.S. businesses near the Canadian border scrambled to deal with the impact. Gutherie Lumber in suburban Detroit reached out Tuesday to Canadian suppliers about the cost of 8-foot wood studs. About 15% of the lumber at the Gutherie yard in Livonia, Michigan, comes from Canada.\n\nSales manager Mike Mahoney said Canadian suppliers are already raising prices. \"They're putting that 25% on studs.'' Builders will strain to stay within their budgets.\n\nAfter years of effort and thousands of dollars in investment, Tom Bard, a Kentucky craft bourbon distiller, gained a foothold in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and watched his sales grow north of the border. Now Kentucky bourbon is in Canada's crosshairs, and an order from his Canadian distributors is on hold.\n\n\"That hurts,\" he said. At his small distillery \"every single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference ... The last thing you want is to have an empty spot where your bottles are supposed to be on a shelf.\"\n\nBard co-owns the Bard Distillery with his wife, Kim, in western Kentucky's Muhlenberg County, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) southwest of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nTrump overwhelmingly carried Kentucky in the November election. In Muhlenberg County, Trump defeated Kamala Harris by a more than 3-to-1 margin.\n\nThe China tariffs also threaten the U.S. toy industry. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be \"crippling,\" as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China.\n\nOwner Rachel Lutz at her Peacock Room women's boutique shop in Detroit's Fisher Building that carries products from Canada, Tuesday, March 4, 2025.

She's been bracing for the tariffs but doesn't understand the logic behind them.\n\n\"I'm struggling to see the wisdom in picking a fight with our largest trading partner that we've had historically wonderful relationships with,\" Lutz said Tuesday from her shop. \"I'm struggling to really understand how they can't see that will profoundly impact our economy in ways that I think the American consumer has not predicted.

(Pool via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Donald Trump's shoot-from-the-lip style kept Americans on the edge of their seats during last year's campaign. But now that he's speaking as a president and not as a candidate, his words are being used against him in court in the blizzard of litigation challenging his agenda .\n\nThe spontaneity is complicating his administration's legal positions. Nowhere has this been clearer than in cases involving his adviser Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, the driving force in his efforts to downsize and overhaul the federal government.\n\nThe latest example came earlier this week when U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled that Musk had likely violated the Constitution by dismantling the United States Agency for International Development.\n\nThe lawsuit turned on the question of whether the billionaire entrepreneur had overstepped his authority. Justice Department lawyers and White House officials insist that Musk is merely a presidential adviser, not the actual leader of DOGE.\n\nBut Trump has said otherwise - in speeches, interviews and public remarks - and Chuang quoted him extensively in his decision.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk speak to reporters near a red Model S Tesla vehicle on the South Lawn of the White House Tuesday, March 11, 2025, in Washington. (Pool via AP)\n\nTrump most notably boasted of creating DOGE during his prime-time address to a joint session of Congress and said it was \"headed by Elon Musk.\" Republicans gave Musk a standing ovation, and he saluted from the gallery above the House chamber.\n\n\"Trump's words were essential, central and indispensable,\" said Norm Eisen, one of the lawyers for USAID employees who filed the lawsuit. \"His admissions took what would have been a tough case and made it into a straightforward one.\"\n\nThe looseness with words is a shift from predecessors like Democratic President Barack Obama, who used to say that he was careful because anything he said could send troops marching or markets tumbling.\n\nTrump has no such feeling of restraint, and neither do other members of his Republican administration such as Musk.\n\nChuang, who is based in Maryland and was nominated by Obama, also cited social media posts from Musk, who writes frequently on X, the platform that he owns.\n\nFor example, Musk posted \"we spent the weekend feeding USAID to the woodchipper\" on Feb. 3. The agency was being brought to a standstill at that time, with staff furloughed, spending halted and headquarters shut down.\n\n\"Musk's public statements and posts ... suggest that he has the ability to cause DOGE to act,\" Chuang wrote in his ruling.\n\nHarrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, said Trump was fulfilling his campaign promise \"to make the federal government more efficient and accountable to taxpayers.\"\n\n\"Rogue bureaucrats and activist judges attempting to undermine this effort are only subverting the will of the American people and their obstructionist efforts will fail,\" he said.\n\nAnthony Coley, who led public affairs at the Justice Department during Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, said statements involving civil litigation were always coordinated between his office and the West Wing.\n\n\"The words could be used to support what we're doing or undermine what we're doing,\" he said. \"It's a carefully choreographed effort to make sure there was no daylight between what was said in the court of public opinion and what could ultimately play out in the court of law.\"\n\nIn comparison to how things were done in the past, Coley said, Trump has a \"ready-fire-aim approach of doing business.\"\n\nTrump doesn't usually let legal disputes force him to turn down the volume. During a criminal investigation over his decision to keep classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after leaving the White House in 2021, Trump spoke extensively about the case in an interview with Fox News.\n\nLongtime defense lawyers were startled because defendants are usually encouraged to keep mum while facing an indictment. But the situation panned out for Trump. His legal team delayed the case , and the special counsel's office dropped the charges after Trump won the election last November - presidents can't be prosecuted while in office.\n\nDOGE has been the focus of nearly two dozen lawsuits. It's often prevailed so far in cases involving access to government data , where several plaintiffs have struggled to convince judges to block the organization's actions.\n\nBut it's also run into challenges, such as a lawsuit over whether DOGE must comply with public records requests. The Trump administration asserted in court that DOGE is part of the White House, meaning it's exempt.\n\nJudge Christopher Cooper, also nominated by Obama, disagreed, siding with a government watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW.\n\n\"Musk and the President's public statements indicate that USDS\" - the original acronym for the organization that was renamed as DOGE - \"is in fact exercising substantial independent authority,\" wrote Cooper, who is based in Washington.\n\nElon Musk flashes his t-shirt that reads \"DOGE\" to the media as he walks on South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, Sunday, March 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nCooper concluded that DOGE can \"identify and terminate federal employees, federal programs, and federal contracts. Doing any of those three things would appear to require substantial independent authority; to do all three surely does.\"\n\nHe ordered DOGE to start responding to requests about the team's role in mass firings and disruptions to federal programs. The administration unsuccessfully asked the judge to reconsider, saying the judge \"fundamentally misapprehended\" the agency's structure.\n\nThe cases are still in their early stages, and the novel legal questions they're raising will take time for the courts to consider, said Michael Fragoso, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and former chief counsel to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n\"What Elon does on Twitter is not necessarily what DOGE does,\" he said. \"My hope would be courts take the time to sift between those two.\"\n\nJust because Musk claims credit online for deep agency cuts, that doesn't necessarily translate to DOGE having authority in the eyes of the law, Stanford Law School professor Michael McConnell argued in a recent debate on the issue.\n\nDOGE is recommending changes, he said, but it's the agency heads who are actually putting them into effect.\n\n\"And that's all that the courts are going to care about as to what the Supreme Court is going to do,\" McConnell said at the debate hosted by the National Constitution Center.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "What It Really Means to 'Give Infectious Disease a Break'\n\nThe Trump administration isn't just dismantling protections against illnesses. It's inviting them right in.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nFor most of the past century, the United States' track record on infectious disease has been quite good. Thanks to major investments in public health, diseases such as smallpox, polio, yellow fever, malaria, measles, rubella, mumps, diphtheria, and tuberculosis have either been obliterated or become vanishingly rare. America \"led the charge,\" Aniruddha Hazra, an infectious-disease physician at UChicago Medicine, told me. The nation's approach to public health was expected to help set the standard for the entire globe's health.\n\nThat era might now be over. In recent years, the U.S. had already begun to neglect its public-health infrastructure, weakening defenses necessary for keeping infectious diseases at bay. Now the Trump administration is going beyond poor maintenance. It's attempting active destruction.\n\nIn two months, the administration has slashed funding for biomedical research ; stripped universities of grants; triggered the halt of clinical trials, domestically and abroad; gutted the public-health workforce; canceled or postponed vaccine advisory meetings to the government; and upended the normal practices of federal agencies dedicated to promoting American health. Cuts to foreign aid have marooned HIV and malaria medications in ports and storage facilities; an Ebola outbreak has been left to swell and spread. Domestically, the federal government's response to a growing measles outbreak has downplayed the protective power of vaccines; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has suggested that H5N1 bird flu should be allowed to burn through the nation's poultry; and the administration is reportedly mulling cuts to the CDC's HIV budget for prevention of the disease in the U.S.\n\nIn November 2023, while campaigning for the presidency, Kennedy declared that he wanted the government to \"give infectious disease a break for about eight years.\" He and the rest of the Trump administration are more than making good on that promise, as they hamper infectious-disease research and the day-to-day work of surveillance and outbreak management. Donald Trump's America isn't just giving infectious disease a break. It's pivoting away from guarding against pathogens to inviting them right in.\n\nIn an email, Emily G. Hilliard, HHS's deputy press secretary, defended Kennedy's actions, and said that the agency \"is committed to promoting radical transparency so Americans can make informed choices regarding their health.\" Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, echoed this notion, and blamed \"shoddy reporting about the Trump administration's work\" for low public trust in the health-care system.\n\nBefore the second Trump administration took office, the United States' investment in keeping infectious disease at bay had already long been flagging. As the nation succeeded in minimizing infectious threats, people forgot to fear them. Since at least the late aughts, U.S. spending on nearly all aspects of public health has gone flat, or declined ; after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, childhood vaccination rates dipped nationwide and failed to bounce back. COVID, rather than reaffirming the country's commitment to public health, cemented many Americans' antagonism toward it.\n\nRead: Inside the collapse at the NIH\n\nWhen most of a community buys into public-health interventions, almost everyone can stay safe. But the more people opt out, the more everyone's health is put at risk. Many Americans have been making that choice more often as of late. During the pandemic, for instance, when calls to vaccinate repeatedly, quarantine, distance, and mask \"bumped up against people's autonomy,\" many Americans chose to hew to what they considered best for themselves as individuals, Lisa M. Lee, a public-health expert and bioethicist at Virginia Tech, told me. Public-health guidelines are not scripture, and Americans will still find plenty of reason to debate when restrictions have gone too far, or when health officials have gotten the guidance wrong. But public health inevitably struggles in a nation where the attitude of \"I don't need to worry about what everyone else is doing; I can control my own health\" has been hardening for years, Eleanor Murray, an infectious-disease epidemiologist, told me.\n\nThat individualistic perspective is now being translated into national policy, even as infectious threats continue to batter the country. After bird flu began to spread rapidly in dairy cattle, then infect farmworkers, the Biden administration lagged in its attempts to track and contain the virus, then largely left decisions about testing cows for the pathogen-the most effective way to track its spread- up to individual farmers . (Under Joe Biden, the Department of Agriculture disputed that its response was insufficient.) By the time the second Trump administration inherited the crisis, H5N1 had already killed an American-but still, the nation's new leaders didn't meaningfully step up the response. In the absence of sufficient cow surveillance, the virus has continued to transmit on farms; without more targeted protection of poultry and dairy workers-those most exposed to H5N1-people have continued to fall sick.\n\nAs the measles outbreak that began in Texas in January has grown-now to the point where the U.S. has logged more measles cases so far this year than it did in all of 2024-Kennedy has emphasized the importance of autonomy. Vaccinating the unvaccinated is the fastest way to stop a measles outbreak , and Kennedy has publicly acknowledged that vaccines protect individuals and \"contribute to community immunity.\" But he's also repeatedly overstated vaccines' risks and declined to directly urge parents to vaccinate their children. And his continued framing of the shots as a \"personal\" choice elides their protective benefits to everyone else. The unvaccinated child killed by the measles outbreak last month almost certainly would not have died had she been vaccinated. And she might never have been infected in the first place had vaccine rates been higher in her community.\n\nThe Trump administration's actions, though, have shown flagrant disregard for the possibility of rising infection rates. Kennedy has pushed good nutrition and vitamin A supplementation as viable solutions to the Texas outbreak-suggesting, essentially, that the country's approach to the disease should be to try to limit the damage of infections rather than prevent them. (Although vitamin A deficiency can worsen a case of measles, that sort of malnutrition is extremely rare in the U.S., and no supplement can prevent a person exposed to measles from catching it.) Meanwhile, the administration's freeze on foreign aid halted PEPFAR, a program that has, for more than 20 years, helped deliver HIV antiretroviral drugs to vulnerable populations around the world, and saved more than 25 million lives. With that support gone, up to 20 million people living with HIV-more than 500,000 of them kids-may have been cut off from their lifesaving medications.\n\nRead: America can't just unpause USAID\n\nThe administration is also considering a major revamp of domestic HIV funding . Among the targets may be the CDC's budget for HIV-the source of 91 percent of federal funding for HIV prevention in the U.S., aimed at tracking infections, increasing access to tests and drugs that can help avert new cases, and helping protect at least 1.2 million Americans estimated to be living with the virus. Strip away access to those sorts of crucial resources, and \"my patients are going to die,\" Jade Pagkas-Bather, an infectious-disease physician at UChicago Medicine, told me. (Hilliard, the HHS spokesperson, told me that \"no final decision on streamlining CDC's HIV Prevention Division has been made.\")\n\nAt times, the administration has verged on advocating for exposure to dangerous germs, Murray pointed out. Kennedy, for instance, has praised the benefits of acquiring immunity to measles through infection, saying that those defenses are longer lasting than immunity derived from vaccination-a statement that doesn't account for the disease's sometimes deadly and debilitating risks-and baselessly claiming that measles infection might also protect against cancers and heart disease. In recent weeks, he's also encouraged poultry farms to simply allow the H5N1 virus to rip its way through their birds-a proposal that could, at the very least, devastate flocks, and at worst, risk the virus morphing into a form that would be able to spread among humans.\n\nIn keeping with his original promise, Kennedy has found plenty of ways to limit biomedical research into infectious disease. The administration has forced the National Institutes of Health to defund research that focuses on LGBTQ populations-including several projects dedicated to HIV-as well as projects that mention vaccine hesitancy. (In an email, Hilliard defended the funding cuts as \"part of a broader effort to redirect resources towards more urgent public health priorities-particularly the ongoing research into the safety and efficacy of vaccines.\") Among the grants rumored to be targeted next are hundreds of studies that involve mRNA vaccines, or work in South Africa, where many global-health projects are centered. Losing those projects might directly lead to more deaths. But the terminations send a subtler message, too, Hazra told me: that many of the already marginalized populations most affected by deadly infectious diseases must fend for themselves.\n\nAbandoning the vulnerable, though, won't make infectious problems disappear-quite the opposite. Left unchecked, diseases spill into new populations, and across borders. Diseases such as measles and polio have been declared eliminated from the United States. Without continued effort, they may not stay that way. And should those diseases reinfiltrate the country permanently, they will sweep over a population ill-equipped to fight them off again. The health infrastructure that the U.S. would have to marshal against them is already weak. More federal layoffs may be coming that could further shrink the public-health workforce. Biomedical research is being upended across fields. And should proposed cuts to Medicaid funding go through, the country will be even less equipped to deliver care to the people who most need it.\n\nRead: America is botching measles\n\nThe administration's actions all emphasize personal freedom. But those values aren't compatible with a country free of epidemics. Infectious diseases, by nature, exploit individualism; their version of liberty is to find the unprotected, and spread more freely. The U.S. has the money, technology, and expertise to be a country minimally affected by infectious disease-as it was for decades. Its current leaders have stopped short of saying that they'd embrace a world rife with infectious death. But their actions suggest that those sacrifices are exactly the kind they are willing to make."

      "text": "Trump's Appetite for Revenge Is Insatiable\n\nThe president is making good on his campaign promise.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for Trump's Return , a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nN o one can say they didn't know.\n\nDuring his first official campaign rally for the 2024 Republican nomination, held in Waco, Texas, Donald Trump vowed retribution against those he perceives as his enemies.\n\n\"I am your warrior,\" he said to his supporters. \"I am your justice. For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.\"\n\nSixty days into Trump's second term, we have begun to see what that looks like.\n\nThe president fired the archivist of the United States because he was enraged at the National Archives for notifying the Justice Department of his alleged mishandling of classified documents after he left office following his first term. (The archivist he fired hadn't even been working for the agency at the time, but that didn't matter.) He also fired two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, a traditionally independent regulatory agency, in violation of Supreme Court precedent and quite likely the language of the statute that created it. (Both members plan to sue to reverse the firings.)\n\nRead: Gulag humor is now everywhere in D.C.\n\nTrump stripped security details from people he had appointed to high office in his first administration and subsequently fell out with, including General Mark Milley, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former National Security Adviser John Bolton, the former diplomat Brian Hook, and the infectious-disease expert Anthony Fauci. The National Institutes of Health, where Fauci worked for 45 years, is being gutted by the Trump administration . The environment there has become \"suffocatingly toxic,\" as my colleague Katherine J. Wu reported.\n\nTrump has sued networks and newspapers for millions of dollars . His Federal Communications Commission is investigating several outlets . And he has called CNN and MSNBC \"corrupt\" and \"illegal\"-not because they have broken any laws, but simply because they have been critical of him.\n\nTrump's FBI director, Kash Patel , told the MAGA podcaster Steve Bannon in a 2023 interview that \"we're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections-we're going to come after you.\"\n\nTrump has also come after the legal profession, expanding his attacks on private law firms and threatening the ability of lawyers to do their job and private citizens to obtain legal counsel. U.S. Marshals have warned federal judges of unusually high threat levels as Elon Musk and other Trump-administration allies \"ramp up efforts to discredit judges,\" according to a Reuters report . On his social-media site, Musk has attacked judges in more than 30 posts since the end of January, calling them \"corrupt,\" \"radical,\" and \"evil,\" and deriding the \"TYRANNY of the JUDICIARY.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Trump targeted a federal judge, James E. Boasberg, who ordered a pause in deportations being carried out under an obscure wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 . Trump, who ignored that court order, called the judge a \"Radical Left Lunatic\" and demanded his impeachment. (Chief Justice John Roberts responded to the president's attack with a rare public rebuke .) Trump and his supporters are clearly looking for a showdown with the judicial branch, which could precipitate a constitutional crisis.\n\nBut that's hardly where the efforts at intimidation end. Trump's antipathy for Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was on vivid display a few weeks ago, when the president berated Zelensky in a televised Oval Office meeting. Trump's hostility toward the Ukrainian president, whom he referred to as a \" dictator ,\" is explained in part by his long-standing affinity for totalitarian leaders such as Vladimir Putin , who invaded Ukraine three years ago. But it almost surely also has to do with Trump's embrace of a conspiracy theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 presidential election in an effort to defeat him . (In fact it was Russia , not Ukraine, that interfered in the election, and on behalf of Trump.)\n\nLast Friday, in the Great Hall of the Justice Department, the president described his adversaries as \"scum,\" \"savages,\" and \"Marxists,\" as well as \"deranged,\" \"thugs,\" \"violent vicious lawyers,\" and \"a corrupt group of hacks and radicals within the ranks of the American government.\"\n\nNo one has any doubt what this means: The department is under Trump's personal control. As if to underscore the point, Attorney General Pam Bondi, who called Trump \"the greatest president in the history of our country,\" said she works \"at the directive of Donald Trump.\" The Justice Department is Trump's weapon for revenge. And his appetite for vengeance is insatiable.\n\nR EVENGE HAS LONG BEEN a central theme for Donald Trump. In a 1992 interview with the journalist Charlie Rose , Trump was asked if he had regrets. Among them, he told Rose, \"I would have wiped the floor with the guys who weren't loyal, which I will now do. I love getting even with people.\" When Rose interjected, \"Slow up. You love getting even with people?\" Trump replied, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nIt's one thing for a real-estate developer to act like a vindictive narcissist ; it's entirely another for an American president to act that way. And in Trump's case, he's been untethered in his second term in ways he wasn't in his first, when top aides were able to check some of his worst tendencies. That won't happen this time.\n\nThe threat this poses to American democracy is obvious. A president and an administration with a Mafia mentality can create a Mafia state. They can target innocent people, shut down dissent, intimidate critics into silence , violate democratic norms, act without any statutory authority, sweep away checks and balances, spread disinformation and conspiracy theories, ignore court orders, and even declare martial law.\n\nRead: Trump's 'secretary of retribution'\n\nWhether all of these things will come to pass is unknowable, because Trump is just getting started. But there is no reason to believe that any internal checks will keep Trump or his administration from crossing any lines. That's especially the case since the Supreme Court issued a ruling last year that provides a former president with immunity from criminal prosecution for all \"official acts\" taken while in office. Trump and MAGA world interpret this, and not without cause, as giving them carte blanche. (Recall that Trump's legal team suggested that a president's directive for SEAL Team Six to kill a political opponent would be an action barred from prosecution, given a former executive's broad immunity.)\n\nB UT SOMETHING ELSE , something quite far-reaching, is going on as well. Trump is having a corrosive effect on the public's civic and moral sensibilities.\n\nIn Democracy in America , Alexis de Tocqueville, in a section on corruption and the vices of rulers in a democracy , warned:\n\nIn a democracy private citizens see a man of their own rank in life who rises from that obscure position in a few years to riches and power; the spectacle excites their surprise and their envy, and they are led to inquire how the person who was yesterday their equal is today their ruler. To attribute his rise to his talents or his virtues is unpleasant, for it is tacitly to acknowledge that they are themselves less virtuous or less talented than he was. They are therefore led, and often rightly, to impute his success mainly to some of his vices; and an odious connection is thus formed between the ideas of turpitude and power, unworthiness and success, utility and dishonor.\n\nTocqueville's concern was that if citizens in a democracy saw that unethical and corrupt behavior led to \"riches and power,\" this would not only normalize such behavior; it would validate and even valorize it. The \"odious connection\" between immoral behavior and worldly success would be first made by the public, which would then emulate that behavior.\n\nThat is the great civic danger posed by Donald Trump, that the habits of his heart become the habits of our hearts; that his code of conduct becomes ours. That we delight in mistreating others almost as much as he does. That vengeance becomes nearly as important to us as it is to him. That dehumanization becomes de rigueur.\n\nTocqueville believed, as did the American Founders, that religion would be the source of republican virtues. What they didn't anticipate was that religion might become a source of republican vices . What happens when, in many cases, religion summons the darker, and sometimes the darkest, impulses in people? When it is Christians who are excusing immoral conduct in our leaders and spreading conspiracy theories, who are at best silent at the decimation of humanitarian programs that may well lead to millions of deaths and who at worst cheer it on, and who champion a public figure who is shattering the load-bearing walls of our democracy?\n\nT HERE IS an important psychological component to all of this as well. Trump's vindictiveness-relentless, crude, and capricious-has reshaped the emotional wiring of many otherwise good and decent people. He tapped into their fears and activated ugly passions that in the past had been kept at bay. In the process, he created a MAGA community that provides its members with a sense of purpose and feelings of solidarity.\n\nA clinical psychologist who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly told me that primal fear is an immediate, instinctual response to perceived danger. Trump was reelected, at least in part, because Americans were told for a very long time to feel very afraid. These Americans believe they will lose their country without Trump. For those in MAGA world, the feeling is: If you're not for me and you're not for Trump, you have no place here.\n\nThe culture war is, for them, a real war, or very close to it, and in real wars, rules have to be broken and enemies have to be destroyed.\n\n\"We're not reasonable,\" Bannon told my colleague David Brooks last year . \"We're unreasonable because we're fighting for a republic. And we're never going to be reasonable until we get what we achieve. We're not looking to compromise. We're looking to win.\"\n\n\"Many people truly believe their country is under siege,\" the psychologist I reached out to told me, \"and they must abandon compromise to save their country. Decency, faith, compassion, and respect are irrelevant in wartime. If one believes their livelihood and legacy is threatened, there is no time for curiosity or compassion.\"\n\nMy Atlantic colleague Jonathan Rauch wrote to me that one thing that's surprised him is, among Trump's supporters, \"the sheer energy that's generated by transgression. The joy of breaking stuff and hurting people. It's a million-volt battery.\" He added: \"I don't think this ends after Trump. He has raised a half generation of ambitious men and women who have been (de)socialized by his style. The most successful businessman in the world is a troll. It's just what smart people do.\"\n\nI N HIS FIRST BOOK written as president of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, Václav Havel-a playwright, human-rights activist, and dissident whose words shook the foundations of the Soviet empire-meditated on politics, morality, and civility. He emphasized, again and again, \"the moral origins of all genuine politics.\"\n\nSome people considered him naive, a hopeless idealist, but he pushed back. \"Evil will remain with us,\" Havel wrote, \"no one will ever eliminate human suffering, the political arena will always attract irresponsible and ambitious adventurers and charlatans. And man will not stop destroying the world. In this regard, I have no illusions.\"\n\nHavel went on: \"Neither I nor anyone else will ever win this war once and for all. At the very most, we can win a battle or two-and not even that is certain. Yet I still think it makes sense to wage this war persistently. It has been waged for centuries, and it will continue to be waged-we hope-for centuries to come. This must be done on principle, because it is the right thing to do.\"\n\nRead: A gala for right-wing revenge\n\nThis 20th-century voice of conscience, who was arrested, tried, and convicted of subversion and spent years in jail as a political prisoner before he became president, wrote this near the end of an essay in Summer Meditations :\n\nSo anyone who claims that I am a dreamer who expects to transform hell into heaven is wrong. I have few illusions. But I feel a responsibility to work towards the things I consider good and right. I don't know whether I'll be able to change certain things for the better, or not at all. Both outcomes are possible. There is only one thing I will not concede: that it might be meaningless to strive in a good cause.\n\nOur republic and its ideals are supremely good causes. We should strive to protect them, which begins by speaking out for them, and by trying to do, in whatever circumstances we find ourselves, what Havel did during his ennobling and consequential life: to once again give depth and dimension to notions such as love, friendship, compassion, humility, and forgiveness. To refuse to live within the lie. And to awaken the goodwill that is slumbering within our society."

Sign up for it here.\n\n\"Everyone is calling it the\"-Donald Trump paused while speaking to a crowd at a rally the day before his inauguration. \"I don't want to say this,\" he insisted. \"It's too braggadocious, but we'll say it anyway-the Trump effect.\" He went on to describe how the stock market was booming and bitcoin prices were surging, and then boasted about a domestic-infrastructure investment from Apple, much of which had already been planned before the November election.\n\nIn spite of his claims to the contrary, Trump has no qualms about taking credit, including for achievements that were in progress or complete before he took office. The president has taken full responsibility for negotiating a hostage swap and a cease-fire deal in the Israel-Hamas war (Trump posted on social media in mid-January that \"this EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November\"), not mentioning that President Joe Biden had announced some of the deal terms last year. The Trump administration said that its policies had quashed migrant border crossings; immigration data are hard to parse, especially for such a short time period, but tallies show that border crossings had already been on the decline during the Biden administration. And this week, Trump credited himself with returning two astronauts who had been stranded for months at the International Space Station; last summer, NASA announced its plan to bring them home in 2025, but Trump still claimed without evidence that Biden \"was embarrassed by what happened, and he said, 'Leave them up there.'\"\n\nTrump relied on similar framing during his campaign: Ahead of a debate with Biden last year, he posted that \"low INSULIN PRICING was gotten for millions of Americans by me, and the Trump Administration, not by Crooked Joe Biden,\" saying of his opponent that \"all he does is try to take credit for things done by others, in this case, ME!\" Shared credit would have been appropriate here: Trump did sign an executive order in his first term that capped out-of-pocket costs of insulin for some Medicare patients at $35 a month, but Biden expanded this cap to all Medicare drug programs through the Inflation Reduction Act, affecting significantly more patients. Trump enjoyed taking credit for Barack Obama-era achievements during his first term too: In 2017, for example, he claimed credit for Obama's immigration plan and bragged about a Ford-factory investment that had been in progress since a 2015 union contract.\n\nPoliticians are storytellers, and Trump is shameless about telling only the version of the story that flatters him. The stock market is thriving under the Biden administration? That's thanks to projections that Trump will win , he claimed last year (even though economists suggested that such gains were also linked to low unemployment, flagging inflation, and solid growth). The economy is struggling after Trump takes office? Blame the \"catastrophic\" situation Biden left him with (even though many economists suggest that recent stock-market downturns are due to anxiety about the effects of Trump's trade war). Talking about the egg-price crisis in January, the White House team pilloried the Biden administration for killing sick chickens, neglecting to note that this was a tack Trump also took during his first term.\n\nBiden struggled to communicate victories during his term, particularly those related to the economy , which left a \"void\" for Trump to fill, Lori Cox Han, a scholar of the presidency at Chapman University, told me. And Americans' perception that the economy was struggling under Biden, boosted by their personal experience of inflation, affected how they voted . Whenever the White House changes hands, some projects inevitably bleed from one administration into the next. Embracing continuity between terms can be a sign that a president cares more about good policy outcomes than about bucking his predecessor: If a federal initiative is good for Americans, why not continue? But Trump is doing something different-he's attempting to erase other presidents' role in policy achievements entirely.\n\nPast presidents have also tried to claim credit for a victory set in motion by the previous administration-or perhaps even to hold off the victory until they can take office. The question of whether Ronald Reagan's aides tried to delay the release of U.S. hostages in Iran so that they could come home during the early days of his administration-with the accompanying photo opportunities-has been discussed for years. Still, Han said, unspoken rules of decorum generally prevent new presidents from claiming full credit or trashing their predecessors. This, she noted, is another norm that Trump has disregarded.\n\nTrump has long sought to portray himself as America's sole savior. Recall his 2016 campaign refrain: \"I alone can fix it.\" As my colleague Yoni Appelbaum wrote at the time, in beseeching Americans to place trust in him and only him, Trump \"broke with two centuries of American political tradition, in which candidates for office-and above all, for the nation's highest office-acknowledge their fallibility and limitations, asking for the help of their fellow Americans, and of God, to accomplish what they cannot do on their own.\" Trump seems set on sending the message that he doesn't need help-and that, implausibly, he hasn't received any along the way.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nToday's News\n\nEvening Read\n\nWhat Impossibly Wealthy Women Do for Love and Fulfillment\n\nBy Sophie Gilbert\n\nAs With Love, Meghan went on, it started to hit a few of the classic pleasure points.

      "text": "The Danger of a Flood of Anti-Trump State Lawsuits\n\nWhat's legal for the goose is also legal for the gander.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nWho will defend the federal government against itself? Donald Trump's administration is waging an aggressive campaign against the executive branch as it has long existed. Democratic leaders in Congress have demonstrated in the past week that they have neither the ability nor the will to slow Trump down. Individual federal employees-such as former Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, whom I profiled last week -have sued, but such suits take time and money that few individuals possess.\n\nState attorneys general, though, see an opportunity. This month, the chief law-enforcement officers of blue states have been working to enforce federal laws against the federal government, and they've had some success.\n\nLast week, a federal judge in Maryland ordered the government to temporarily rehire thousands of probationary federal workers in many departments. The judge, James Bredar, concluded that the administration had mass-fired workers using bogus claims of performance issues rather than the required procedures for a reduction in force. \"The sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any argument that these terminations were due to the employees' individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct,\" he wrote.\n\nThat's plain enough. What is interesting is that the suit was brought not by the workers who'd been fired but by Democratic attorneys general in 20 states. In order to convince the court that they had standing to intervene, even though the workers are private citizens employed by the federal government, they alleged that their states were harmed in various ways, focusing on how the failure to provide the legally required notice of the terminations left states scrambling to provide services to the workers. They also argued that the layoffs harmed the states because of lost income taxes. Bredar was fairly skeptical of some of the economic arguments but found that the states nonetheless had standing to sue.\n\nThe probationary-workers case is just one of several such lawsuits. In another last week, 21 states petitioned courts to prevent the Education Department from firing hundreds of workers. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to review rulings by lower courts, which were successfully petitioned by state attorneys general, that block his executive order purporting to get rid of birthright citizenship . If you're not a fan of the Trump administration, these developments may seem like great news. But what's legal for the goose is also legal for the gander, which is why state lawsuits on federal issues are something that should perhaps give all Americans pause.\n\nStates have long sued the federal government over alleged impositions on their prerogatives, but in 2007, after Massachusetts sued the EPA for failing to regulate carbon dioxide, the justices ruled for the state and said that states have special standing to sue in federal court to ensure that federal agencies are following federal laws. State attorneys general were more than happy to take advantage of the new leeway.\n\n\"What we've seen since around the George W. Bush administration is this massive increase in state lawsuits,\" Tara Leigh Grove , a law professor at the University of Texas, told me. \"It's just the name of the states that change from administration to administration.\"\n\nThat time period coincides with increasing partisan polarization. Although attorney general is ostensibly a lawyerly position, an old joke runs that AG is an abbreviation for aspiring governor . Having a big legal fight with a president of the opposing party is a good credential to have as a candidate. In 2013, then-Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott described his job this way: \"I go into the office in the morning, I sue Barack Obama, and then I go home.\" Since then, he has landed a new job-as governor of Texas.\n\nTwo partisan organizations, the Republican Attorneys General Association and the Democratic Attorneys General Association, have grown in importance in recent years, raking in millions in outside contributions . These groups are subject to the same capture by special interests that has come to dominate other areas of politics, with the same warping effect on their incentives that it has everywhere else.\n\nEven when attorneys general aren't motivated by base partisanship (in both senses of the word base ), they don't necessarily represent the interests of all Americans. What is valuable and important to constituents in Nevada may be very different from what's valuable and important to those in South Carolina. This is why we have a federal government that sets national policies, but in a moment of tumult, state attorneys general are one of the few forces that can battle Washington.\n\nGrove told me she understands why Trump critics might see lawsuits by state attorneys general as a godsend. The administration is taking many actions that \"neither Republican nor Democratic administrations have thought to do, and that's really, really jarring,\" she said. \"There's a desire for a check in the system, and right now, a lot of people are looking to the courts as the key check to the system.\"\n\nBut not all checks are created equal. One of my enduring interests in the Trump era has been the ways in which he forces the country to choose between bad and worse situations. For example, charging a former president with crimes sets a dangerous precedent that could precipitate political retribution, but not charging a former president who allegedly absconded with documents and attempted to subvert an election sets an even worse one.\n\nSomething similar, though less drastic, is at play here. Is it better for states to have no recourse at all, or to have recourse that the other political side can use to tie you in knots? You might have approved of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton using such suits to hamstring Joe Biden's administration-but if so, you might be less enthused about Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown using the same methods to prevent Trump from enacting his priorities. And the flood of state lawsuits producing nationwide injunctions has made it more difficult for presidential administrations of either party to implement their agenda.\n\nSome scholars see more positive effects. They note , among other things, that state and federal implementation of laws is so intertwined that attempting to disentangle the interests of each is practically impossible. They also celebrate state lawsuits as a tool of dissent-for example, from the excesses of the Bush-era Patriot Act. But enlarging the power of states cuts both ways. Progressives have historically been skeptical of states'-rights arguments, in part because they were once used to defend racist policies within state boundaries. In a nationally polarized environment, where states are asking courts to block laws nationwide, the effect is even broader.

He shows no sign that he would accept a loss in the future.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for Trump's Return , a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nEight years ago, President Donald Trump got generally good reviews for his first speech to a joint session of Congress. Back then, it would have seemed both incredible and churlish to suggest that the man who delivered that relatively conciliatory, relatively presidential speech might within four years try to overturn an election by violence.\n\nBut that's what happened. And that attempt remains the single most important fact about Trump's first term as president.\n\nEight years later, not even Trump's staunchest partisans would describe his 2025 address as conciliatory. He mocked, he insulted, he called names, he appealed only to a MAGA base that does not add up to even half the electorate. But in 2025, the big question hanging over the nation's head is not one about oratory, but about democracy. In 2017, Americans did not yet know how far Trump might go. Now they do. They only flinch from believing it.\n\nSecond-term Trump has opened his administration with a round of actions likely to prove drastically unpopular: tariffs that raise prices; budget cuts that will reduce services for veterans, at national parks, for anyone who depends on weather services. Prices are rising, measles is spreading, airplanes are falling out of the sky. His effective co-president and chief policy maker, Elon Musk, is widely distrusted and disliked . Trump's repeated claims of massive fraud within Social Security strongly suggest that he's got something big and radical in mind for the most popular program in American life.\n\nTrump knows he's steering into political trouble. He alluded to \"disruptions\" ahead because of his policies. His party holds the narrowest of margins in the House of Representatives. Yet he's governing without the slightest concession to majority opinion, even to a majority sense of decency. He talks of the Democrats as remorseless enemies. At the same time, he is making political choices that would normally seem certain to deliver those enemies a big majority in the House after the midterms. Is he delusional? Crazy reckless? Or is this a signal that the man who tried to overturn the election of 2020 has some scheme in mind for the 2026 midterms?\n\nMaybe Trump has turned over a new leaf. There was, however, a tell in this speech that Trump's attitude to other people's consent remains as contemptuous as ever.\n\nIn his joint-session speech, Trump returned to his fancy of annexing Greenland to the United States. He read aloud from the teleprompter some perfunctory language about respecting Greenlanders' right to decide their own future. But when he came to the end of the section, he apparently ad-libbed a thought of his own: \"We'll get it one way or another.\" That's not the language of a man who has learned his lesson about respecting democratic choice.\n\nIn the second term, unlike the first, Trump has swiftly and methodically installed do-anything loyalists at the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Defense. Given Trump's 2021 record, that seems something to worry about now.\n\nHad Trump lost the 2024 election, he would right now be facing sentencing for his criminal convictions in the state of New York. He would be facing criminal and civil trials in other states. He was rescued from legal troubles by political success. Now Trump's acting in ways that seem certain to throw power away in the next round of elections-if those elections proceed as usual. If they are free and fair. If every legal voter is allowed to participate. If every legal vote is counted, whether cast in person or by mail. Those did not use to be hazardous \"if\"s. But they may be hazardous in 2026.\n\nTrump is keenly alert to his legal danger, deeply committed to keeping power by any means necessary. He also seems to be sleepwalking toward a stinging political loss that will expose him to all kinds of personal risk. He's not trying to expand his coalition, to win any votes he does not already have. So what is his plan to preserve his immunity and his impunity? Trump's behavior in 2021 showed that there were no limits to what he would do to keep power. What will 2026 show?"

      "text": "The Global Populist Right Has a MAGA Problem\n\nIn Europe, Trump looks too extreme even for many right-wing insurgents.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nNigel Farage loves Donald Trump. The 60-year-old's day job is as the parliamentary representative for the English seaside town of Clacton, and as the leader of Reform, the latest of his populist right-wing parties. But Farage is often focused on America, and his heavily advertised friendship with the 47th president. He was in Washington, D.C., for the inauguration (and chafing that he didn't get a prime spot in the Capitol Rotunda). He was also onstage last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, joking to his American audience that \"you gave us 'woke,' and we gave you Prince Harry.\"\n\nAs the leader of a party with fewer than half a dozen members of Parliament, Farage knows that his American profile gives him a grandeur he would not otherwise possess. In December, he posed with Elon Musk at Mar-a-Lago under a portrait of a young Trump in cricket whites. Days after Trump survived an assassination attempt in July, Farage flew to the United States on a mission funded by a wealthy Reform donor. On his parliamentary financial-disclosure form , Farage recorded the purpose of his trip as being \"to support a friend who was almost killed and to represent Clacton on the world stage.\" Lucky Clacton.\n\nBut now Farage's embrace of Trump has become a liability. The 47th president is broadly unpopular in Britain, where Farage hopes to improve the 14.3 percent vote share he received in last year's election. (He likely needs to at least double that proportion if he wants to be prime minister one day.) Even worse for him, Trump's MAGA movement is seen as overtly racist and pro-Russia, two huge turnoffs for the majority of British voters. Even Britain's right-wing newspapers were outraged by Trump's shabby treatment of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, while Reform's existing voters are already outliers in their sharply anti-immigration views. Heading further to the right is not a winning strategy in Britain.\n\nOr elsewhere, really. \"The populist right around the world has a MAGA problem,\" Sunder Katwala, the director of the think tank British Future, told me. \"There is a backfire effect in countries that aren't America.\"\n\nAnne Applebaum: The rise of the brutal American\n\nKey figures in Trumpworld, such as Musk and Steve Bannon, continually urge European populists to take more extreme positions on race, immigration, and cultural issues. Hard-liners usually point to the success of the German far-right party AfD (known in English as Alternative for Germany), which placed second in the country's recent elections, its best showing ever. Musk had enthusiastically endorsed the AfD's leader, Alice Weidel, and he celebrated the result with a personal phone call to her.\n\nIn truth, the AfD did not achieve the electoral breakthrough its leaders hoped for. Although conditions were perfect for a populist surge-Germany's economy is stagnant , and a car attack by an Afghan refugee 10 days before the vote helped keep immigration at the forefront of the national conversation-the AfD struggled to gain a foothold outside the former East Germany. Other parties still refuse to include it in coalition talks. By dabbling in German politics, Trumpworld's second-most-powerful figure hurt his own business interests while being at best irrelevant to the AfD's performance. The party \"got nothing out of Musk's backing,\" Katwala told me. \"It transformed Tesla's reputation in Germany, but did nothing for the AfD.\"\n\nUltimately, Trump's fundamental positions have limited appeal to most European electorates. His abandonment of Ukraine is so unpopular in Europe that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen-two natural MAGA sympathizers-have carefully distanced themselves from it.\n\nAs MAGA becomes ever more extreme, allies such as Farage must decide how far to go along with it-in the knowledge that, if they do not oblige, their domestic rivals will. The Reform leader has just fallen out with one of his five MPs, in a drama precipitated by (who else?) Musk, which played out on (where else?) X. Back in January, Trump's \"first buddy\" declared his support for the agitator Tommy Robinson, whom Musk credited with publicizing the so-called grooming gangs of men, mostly British citizens of Pakistani descent, who raped and trafficked girls in towns across England. But Farage recognizes Robinson for what he is: a rabble-rouser with numerous criminal convictions. When the Reform leader repeated his long-standing refusal to admit Robinson to his party, Musk declared that Farage \"doesn't have what it takes.\"\n\nRead: Elon has appointed himself king of the world\n\nMusk's preferred alternative to lead Reform was Rupert Lowe, a 67-year-old who used to be chairman of a soccer club. Lowe's day job is representing another English seaside town, Great Yarmouth, in Parliament. But his passion is posting on X. His disclosure forms show that he now makes about $4,000 a month from pumping out spicy takes on Musk's social network, and all the attention appears to have gone to Lowe's head. He recently told the Daily Mail that Farage saw himself as a \"Messiah\" and that Reform risked being a \"protest party\" unless its leader surrounded himself with good people. By enormous coincidence, soon after the interview was published, Lowe was suspended from Reform for alleged HR violations.\n\nCast out from Farage's party, Lowe has since become even more extreme-a known side effect of spending too much time on social media. He wants the families of grooming-gang offenders deported from Britain, not just men convicted of crimes-and perhaps even \"entire communities\" of British Pakistanis, who he says have ignored the problem. (The white police officers and social workers who might face the same accusation do not appear to bother him.) Lowe claims that his party leader tried to stop him from expressing these views, an assertion that I instinctively believe; Farage, sometimes known as the father of Brexit, has succeeded in disrupting British politics because he knows when a dog whistle is preferable to a whistle. He has repeatedly forced out people from his various parties when their inflammatory rhetoric tipped into overt extremism. In 2018, he left the U.K. Independence Party after it appointed Robinson as an adviser.\n\nFarage has a winning formula, Katwala believes: be guided by the British press. \"If the Mail and The Telegraph think the candidate has a racism problem, ditch them,\" he said, referring to two right-leaning papers. \"If it's just The Guardian \"-which leans left-\"you're fine.\" In the U.S., however, any such boundaries have collapsed. The breadth of permitted opinion, Katwala said, \"goes all the way out to the Proud Boys\"-the far-right group whose leader was jailed for his part in the Capitol insurrection, and then pardoned by Trump.\n\nVoters outside the United States have one more objection to the MAGA movement: Trump and his allies talk about other countries in a profoundly alienating way. \"America First\"? Fine, but not \"America Thinks Your Tin-Pot Country Is a Joke.\" The toxic combination of Trump's pro-Russia leanings, Vice President J. D. Vance's arrogance and condescension , and Musk's sad case of advanced poster's disease have tanked America's reputation among its traditional allies.\n\nThe exultant right-wing influencers who cheer on MAGA's sassy clapback anti-diplomacy should remember that insulting another country's politicians is like insulting someone else's family. I can be rude about my sister, but you can't. The Trump administration has revived almost every negative stereotype that Europeans have about Americans: too loud, too brash, too big . Vance, who lectures U.S. allies about how to run their affairs, reminds us of every rich guy from suburban Pittsburgh who visits the Amalfi Coast in the summer, drives up the pedestrianized streets, and then complains that the pasta is too chewy and there's no AC in his 15th-century villa.\n\nAs a result, even formerly bloodless technocrats have found new vigor when being picked on by the Trump administration. So far, the net effect of MAGA foreign policy has been to get exactly zero concessions from Moscow, while simultaneously reviving the fortunes of Canada's Liberal Party and helping the mainstream center-right win in Greenland. The new prime minister of Canada, the former central banker Mark Carney, was able to appeal to voters' patriotism when rebutting Trump's demand to annex his country, and his punitive tariffs. \"Americans should make no mistake-in trade, as in hockey, Canada will win,\" Carney said, after taking over the Liberal leadership from Justin Trudeau. The Liberals have been able to stop their opponent Pierre Poilievre's momentum by painting him as a MAGA lackey. \"A person who worships at the altar of Donald Trump will kneel before him, not stand up to him,\" Carney said .\n\nFriedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's center-right Christian Democrats, has been similarly energized. During a televised debate ahead of the recent German elections, he attacked the AfD for drawing support from the MAGA movement, painting his rivals as unpatriotic. \"The interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow,\" he added.\n\nBen Ansell, a University of Oxford politics professor, believes that MAGA's sympathy for Moscow has given Europe's mainstream politicians a potent attack line. \"We may finally be witnessing the moment of hubris for the past decade's unstoppable rise of populism,\" he wrote in a recent Substack post. When mainstream politicians attack conservative populists, the latter can easily shrug off any criticism as the revenge of elites. \"Populists who actually side with an existing foreign enemy, though? Well, that clarifies matters. Now every decision the populist takes can be tied to the foreign enemy.\" In recent weeks, Farage's approval ratings have noticeably fallen.\n\nRead: How not to hand populists a weapon\n\n\"If you're being directly attacked by Trump and you have your own elections, it's hard to imagine being very successful in those elections by saying: Yes, please ,\" Ansell told me. Farage is plainly struggling to balance his desire to be close to MAGA with his domestic ambitions.\n\nPopulist parties define themselves as being against the status quo and the mainstream, but many of their members (and voters) hold eclectic and divergent views on economics and other issues. \"These parties are more fragile than people have thought, and now you have this little lever that mainstream parties can use to split them apart-their closeness to much hated figures,\" Ansell told me. European voters have long been wary of Moscow's intentions. What's new is a sense that the people now running the United States have lined up with Russia-and against Europe. \"Vladimir Putin has been around for a quarter of a century,\" Ansell said. \"It's Musk and Trump.\"\n\nPopulists outside America might love the reflected glow of MAGA's power and success, but being linked to the Trump administration means tethering themselves, in the eyes of their home audiences, to an unpopular president, his unpopular celebrity adviser, his unpopular stance on Ukraine, and his unpopular bullying tactics. That is populists' MAGA problem-and the mainstream's opportunity to fight back."

      "text": "One Word Describes Trump\n\nA century ago, a German sociologist explained precisely how the president thinks about the world.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for Trump's Return , a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nW hat exactly is Donald Trump doing?\n\nSince taking office, he has reduced his administration's effectiveness by appointing to essential agencies people who lack the skills and temperaments to do their jobs. His mass firings have emptied the civil service of many of its most capable employees. He has defied laws that he could just as easily have followed ( for instance , refusing to notify Congress 30 days before firing inspectors general). He has disregarded the plain language of statutes, court rulings, and the Constitution , setting up confrontations with the courts that he is likely to lose. Few of his orders have gone through a policy-development process that helps ensure they won't fail or backfire-thus ensuring that many will .\n\nIn foreign affairs, he has antagonized Denmark, Canada, and Panama; renamed the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\"; and unveiled a Gaz-a-Lago plan. For good measure, he named himself chair of the Kennedy Center, as if he didn't have enough to do.\n\nEven those who expected the worst from his reelection (I among them) expected more rationality. Today, it is clear that what has happened since January 20 is not just a change of administration but a change of regime -a change, that is, in our system of government. But a change to what?\n\nGraeme Wood: Germany's anti-extremist firewall is collapsing\n\nThere is an answer, and it is not classic authoritarianism-nor is it autocracy, oligarchy, or monarchy. Trump is installing what scholars call patrimonialism. Understanding patrimonialism is essential to defeating it. In particular, it has a fatal weakness that Democrats and Trump's other opponents should make their primary and relentless line of attack.\n\nL ast year, two professors published a book that deserves wide attention. In The Assault on the State: How the Global Attack on Modern Government Endangers Our Future , Stephen E. Hanson, a government professor at the College of William & Mary, and Jeffrey S. Kopstein, a political scientist at UC Irvine, resurface a mostly forgotten term whose lineage dates back to Max Weber, the German sociologist best known for his seminal book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism .\n\nWeber wondered how the leaders of states derive legitimacy, the claim to rule rightfully. He thought it boiled down to two choices. One is rational legal bureaucracy (or \"bureaucratic proceduralism\"), a system in which legitimacy is bestowed by institutions following certain rules and norms. That is the American system we all took for granted until January 20. Presidents, federal officials, and military inductees swear an oath to the Constitution, not to a person.\n\nThe other source of legitimacy is more ancient, more common, and more intuitive-\"the default form of rule in the premodern world,\" Hanson and Kopstein write. \"The state was little more than the extended 'household' of the ruler; it did not exist as a separate entity.\" Weber called this system \"patrimonialism\" because rulers claimed to be the symbolic father of the people-the state's personification and protector. Exactly that idea was implied in Trump's own chilling declaration : \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\"\n\nIn his day, Weber thought that patrimonialism was on its way to history's scrap heap. Its personalized style of rule was too inexpert and capricious to manage the complex economies and military machines that, after Bismarck, became the hallmarks of modern statehood. Unfortunately, he was wrong.\n\nPatrimonialism is less a form of government than a style of governing. It is not defined by institutions or rules; rather, it can infect all forms of government by replacing impersonal, formal lines of authority with personalized, informal ones. Based on individual loyalty and connections, and on rewarding friends and punishing enemies (real or perceived), it can be found not just in states but also among tribes, street gangs, and criminal organizations.\n\nIn its governmental guise, patrimonialism is distinguished by running the state as if it were the leader's personal property or family business. It can be found in many countries, but its main contemporary exponent-at least until January 20, 2025-has been Vladimir Putin. In the first portion of his rule, he ran the Russian state as a personal racket. State bureaucracies and private companies continued to operate, but the real governing principle was Stay on Vladimir Vladimirovich's good side ... or else.\n\nSeeking to make the world safe for gangsterism, Putin used propaganda, subversion, and other forms of influence to spread the model abroad. Over time, the patrimonial model gained ground in states as diverse as Hungary, Poland, Turkey, and India. Gradually (as my colleague Anne Applebaum has documented ), those states coordinated in something like a syndicate of crime families-\"working out problems,\" write Hanson and Kopstein in their book, \"divvying up the spoils, sometimes quarreling, but helping each other when needed. Putin in this scheme occupied the position of the capo di tutti capi , the boss of bosses.\"\n\nUntil now. Move over, President Putin.\n\nT o understand the source of Trump's hold on power, and its main weakness, one needs to understand what patrimonialism is not. It is not the same as classic authoritarianism. And it is not necessarily antidemocratic.\n\nRead: Trump says the corrupt part out loud\n\nPatrimonialism's antithesis is not democracy; it is bureaucracy, or, more precisely, bureaucratic proceduralism. Classic authoritarianism-the sort of system seen in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union-is often heavily bureaucratized. When authoritarians take power, they consolidate their rule by creating structures such as secret police, propaganda agencies, special military units, and politburos. They legitimate their power with legal codes and constitutions. Orwell understood the bureaucratic aspect of classic authoritarianism; in 1984, Oceania's ministries of Truth (propaganda), Peace (war), and Love (state security) are the regime's most characteristic (and terrifying) features.\n\nBy contrast, patrimonialism is suspicious of bureaucracies; after all, to exactly whom are they loyal? They might acquire powers of their own, and their rules and processes might prove obstructive. People with expertise, experience, and distinguished résumés are likewise suspect because they bring independent standing and authority. So patrimonialism stocks the government with nonentities and hacks, or, when possible, it bypasses bureaucratic procedures altogether. When security officials at USAID tried to protect classified information from Elon Musk's uncleared DOGE team, they were simply put on leave . Patrimonial governance's aversion to formalism makes it capricious and even whimsical-such as when the leader announces, out of nowhere, the renaming of international bodies of water or the U.S. occupation of Gaza.\n\nAlso unlike classic authoritarianism, patrimonialism can coexist with democracy, at least for a while. As Hanson and Kopstein write, \"A leader may be democratically elected but still seek to legitimate his or her rule patrimonially. Increasingly, elected leaders have sought to demolish bureaucratic administrative states ('deep states,' they sometimes call them) built up over decades in favor of rule by family and friends.\" India's Narendra Modi, Hungary's Viktor Orbán, and Trump himself are examples of elected patrimonial leaders-and ones who have achieved substantial popular support and democratic legitimacy. Once in power, patrimonialists love to clothe themselves in the rhetoric of democracy, like Elon Musk justifying his team's extralegal actions as making the \"unelected fourth unconstitutional branch of government\" be \"responsive to the people.\"\n\nNonetheless, as patrimonialism snips the government's procedural tendons, it weakens and eventually cripples the state. Over time, as it seeks to embed itself, many leaders attempt the transition to full-blown authoritarianism. \"Electoral processes and constitutional norms cannot survive long when patrimonial legitimacy begins to dominate the political arena,\" write Hanson and Kopstein.\n\nEven if authoritarianism is averted, the damage that patrimonialism does to state capacity is severe. Governments' best people leave or are driven out. Agencies' missions are distorted and their practices corrupted. Procedures and norms are abandoned and forgotten. Civil servants, contractors, grantees, corporations, and the public are corrupted by the habit of currying favor.\n\nTo say, then, that Trump lacks the temperament or attention span to be a dictator offers little comfort. He is patrimonialism's perfect organism. He recognizes no distinction between what is public and private, legal and illegal, formal and informal, national and personal. \"He can't tell the difference between his own personal interest and the national interest, if he even understands what the national interest is,\" John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term, told The Bulwark . As one prominent Republican politician recently told me, understanding Trump is simple: \"If you're his friend, he's your friend. If you're not his friend, he's not your friend.\" This official chose to be Trump's friend. Otherwise, he said, his job would be nearly impossible for the next four years.\n\nPatrimonialism explains what might otherwise be puzzling. Every policy the president cares about is his personal property. Trump dropped the federal prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams because a pliant big-city mayor is a useful thing to have. He broke with 50 years of practice by treating the Justice Department as \" his personal law firm .\" He treats the enforcement of duly enacted statutes as optional-and, what's more, claims the authority to indemnify lawbreakers . He halted proceedings against January 6 thugs and rioters because they are on his side. His agencies screen hires for loyalty to him rather than to the Constitution.\n\nIn Trump's world, federal agencies are shut down on his say-so without so much as a nod to Congress. Henchmen with no statutory authority barge into agencies and take them over. A loyalist who had only ever managed two small nonprofits is chosen for the hardest management job in government. Conflicts of interest are tolerated if not outright blessed. Prosecutors and inspectors general are fired for doing their job. Thousands of civil servants are converted to employment at the president's will. Former officials' security protection is withdrawn because they are disloyal. The presidency itself is treated as a business opportunity .\n\nY et when Max Weber saw patrimonialism as obsolete in the era of the modern state, he was not daydreaming. As Hanson and Kopstein note, \"Patrimonial regimes couldn't compete militarily or economically with states led by expert bureaucracies.\" They still can't. Patrimonialism suffers from two inherent and in many cases fatal shortcomings.\n\nThe first is incompetence. \"The arbitrary whims of the ruler and his personal coterie continually interfere with the regular functioning of state agencies,\" write Hanson and Kopstein. Patrimonial regimes are \"simply awful at managing any complex problem of modern governance,\" they write. \"At best they supply poorly functioning institutions, and at worst they actively prey on the economy.\" Already, the administration seems bent on debilitating as much of the government as it can. Some examples of incompetence, such as the reported firing of staffers who safeguard nuclear weapons and prevent bird flu , would be laughable if they were not so alarming.\n\nEventually, incompetence makes itself evident to the voting public without needing too much help from the opposition. But helping the public understand patrimonialism's other, even greater vulnerability-corruption-requires relentless messaging.\n\nRead: This is what happens when the DOGE guys take over\n\nPatrimonialism is corrupt by definition, because its reason for being is to exploit the state for gain-political, personal, and financial. At every turn, it is at war with the rules and institutions that impede rigging, robbing, and gutting the state. We know what to expect from Trump's second term. As Larry Diamond of Stanford University's Hoover Institution said in a recent podcast , \"I think we are going to see an absolutely staggering orgy of corruption and crony capitalism in the next four years unlike anything we've seen since the late 19th century, the Gilded Age.\" (Francis Fukuyama, also of Stanford, replied: \"It's going to be a lot worse than the Gilded Age.\")\n\nThey weren't wrong. \"In the first three weeks of his administration,\" reported the Associated Press , \"President Donald Trump has moved with brazen haste to dismantle the federal government's public integrity guardrails that he frequently tested during his first term but now seems intent on removing entirely.\" The pace was eye-watering. Over the course of just a couple of days in February, for example, the Trump administration:\n\ngutted enforcement of statutes against foreign influence, thus, according to the former White House counsel Bob Bauer , reducing \"the legal risks faced by companies like the Trump Organization that interact with government officials to advance favorable conditions for business interests shared with foreign governments, and foreign-connected partners and counterparties\";\n\nsuspended enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, further reducing, wrote Bauer, \"legal risks and issues posed for the Trump Organization's engagements with government officials both at home and abroad\";\n\nfired , without cause, the head of the government's ethics office, a supposedly independent agency overseeing anti-corruption rules and financial disclosures for the executive branch;\n\nfired , also without cause, the inspector general of USAID after the official reported that outlay freezes and staff cuts had left oversight \"largely nonoperational.\"\n\nBy that point, Trump had already eviscerated conflict-of-interest rules, creating, according to Bauer , \"ample space for foreign governments, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to work directly with the Trump Organization or an affiliate within the framework of existing agreements in ways highly beneficial to its business interests.\" He had fired inspectors general in 19 agencies , without cause and probably illegally. One could go on-and Trump will.\n\nC orruption is patrimonialism's Achilles' heel because the public understands it and doesn't like it. It is not an abstraction like \"democracy\" or \"Constitution\" or \"rule of law.\" It conveys that the government is being run for them , not for you . The most dire threat that Putin faced was Alexei Navalny's \" ceaseless crusade \" against corruption, which might have brought down the regime had Putin not arranged for Navalny's death in prison. In Poland, the liberal opposition booted the patrimonialist Law and Justice Party from power in 2023 with an anti-corruption narrative .\n\nIn the United States, anyone seeking evidence of the power of anti-corruption need look no further than Republicans' attacks against Jim Wright and Hillary Clinton. In Clinton's case, Republicans and Trump bootstrapped a minor procedural violation (the use of a private server for classified emails) into a world-class scandal. Trump and his allies continually lambasted her as the most corrupt candidate ever . Sheer repetition convinced many voters that where there was smoke, there must be fire.\n\nEven more on point is Newt Gingrich's successful campaign to bring down Democratic House Speaker Jim Wright-a campaign that ended Wright's career, launched Gingrich's, and paved the way for the Republicans' takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994. In the late 1980s, Wright was a congressional titan and Gingrich an eccentric backbencher, but Gingrich had a plan. \"I'll just keep pounding and pounding on his [Wright's] ethics,\" he said in 1987. \"There comes a point where it comes together and the media takes off on it, or it dies.\" Gingrich used ethics complaints and relentless public messaging (not necessarily fact-based) to brand Wright and, by implication, the Democrats as corrupt. \"In virtually every speech and every interview, he attacked Wright,\" John M. Barry wrote in Politico . \"He told his audiences to write letters to the editor of their local newspapers, to call in on talk shows, to demand answers from their local members of Congress in public meetings. In his travels, he also sought out local political and investigative reporters or editorial writers, and urged them to look into Wright. And Gingrich routinely repeated, 'Jim Wright is the most corrupt speaker in the 20th century.'\"\n\nRead: Why Meta is paying $25 million to settle a Trump lawsuit\n\nToday, Gingrich's campaign offers the Democrats a playbook. If they want to undermine Trump's support, this model suggests that they should pursue a relentless, strategic, and thematic campaign branding Trump as America's most corrupt president. Almost every development could provide fodder for such attacks, which would connect corruption not with generalities like the rule of law but with kitchen-table issues. Higher prices? Crony capitalism! Cuts to popular programs? Payoffs for Trump's fat-cat clients! Tax cuts? A greedy raid on Social Security !\n\nThe best objection to this approach (perhaps the only objection, at this point) is that the corruption charge won't stick against Trump. After all, the public has been hearing about his corruption for years and has priced it in or just doesn't care. Besides, the public believes that all politicians are corrupt anyway.\n\nBut driving a strategic, coordinated message against Trump's corruption is exactly what the opposition has not done. Instead, it has reacted to whatever is in the day's news. By responding to daily fire drills and running in circles, it has failed to drive any message at all.\n\nAlso, it is not quite true that the public already knows Trump is corrupt and doesn't care. Rather, because he seems so unfiltered, he benefits from a perception that he is authentic in a way that other politicians are not, and because he infuriates elites, he enjoys a reputation for being on the side of the common person. Breaking those perceptions can determine whether his approval rating is above 50 percent or below 40 percent, and politically speaking, that is all the difference in the world.\n\nDo the Democrats need a positive message of their own? Sure, they should do that work. But right now, when they are out of power and Trump is the capo di tutti capi , the history of patrimonial rule suggests that their most effective approach will be hammering home the message that he is corrupt. One thing is certain: He will give them plenty to work with."

      "text": "The Death of Scandal\n\nShocking revelations often used to lead to meaningful governmental reforms. But not in the age of Donald Trump.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nAs President Donald Trump proceeds with his seemingly endless attacks on laws and democratic norms, the question for many has become: What will turn the tide? They may imagine that conditions are ripe for a major scandal-some transgression, previously hidden but then revealed, that is so outrageous, so beyond the pale, that it will rally even those across the political divide.\n\nIn the past, that is the work that scandal often did. Exposure of serious official misconduct, the lifeblood of scandals, would create openings for reform. As bad as these scandals were-and the underlying story was usually bad, sometimes very bad-scandals contained within them the germ of change. But today, old-fashioned scandals are harder and harder to come by.\n\nWatergate is in many ways the textbook example of a scandal and its reforming potential. It had it all: covert and illegal actions by a president in contravention of laws and norms, the revelation of the scandalous activities, and, eventually, bipartisan agreement on corrective action and reform. Those reforms included extensive new regulation of money and politics, protection against the abuse of surveillance power to spy on American citizens, and authority for independent investigations of possible executive-branch criminal misconduct.\n\nJonathan Rauch: One word describes Trump\n\nThis cycle of scandal and bipartisan reform is hardly imaginable today. In the Trump administration, what might have been deemed scandalous at another time, in another presidency, is instead a governing program. The components of the program-\"radical constitutional\" claims about presidential power, White House direction of investigations against political opponents, the abandonment of constraints on profiting from the office-are openly avowed and openly pursued. What was hidden until exposed in the Richard Nixon years is proclaimed in these Trump years as a show of presidential resolve and as the vindication of an electoral mandate. Nixon had resigned and left his office before he told an interviewer that, by definition, no presidential action can violate the law. Trump expressed the same view -that no president can violate the law if he is striving to save the country-in the first weeks of his second term. He is redefining the presidency, resetting expectations of his office.\n\nThe death of scandal is a blow to the mechanisms for defending a democracy. More than periodically useful in uncovering corruption, scandal is an essential feature of liberal democracy . It is certainly, the sociologist John Thompson writes, \" more common [in such systems] than in authoritarian regimes or in one-party states.\" This is because, in democracies, scandal is possible only because there is intense electoral competition, a free press, and protections from reprisal for news organizations, the political opposition, and others that allege and often expose corruption in the government in power. But when democratic norms fray or collapse, scandal collapses with them. In this way, the collapse of scandal is both cause and effect of democratic decline: It makes reform less possible, and it indicates erosion of the conditions that made such revelations possible in the first place.\n\nTrump is directly attacking those conditions. He is maintaining and in some instances escalating lawsuits against news organizations. He has fired inspectors general who serve as \"watchdogs\" in 17 executive-branch agencies. Trump has fired the head of the Office of Special Counsel, whose responsibilities include enforcement of the whistleblower statutes, and replaced him with a former Republican member of Congress who is also the secretary of Veterans Affairs-effectively making it a part-time position. He is exploiting the fractured and polarized media environment to create alternative realities, rendering it very difficult for any sort of unified narrative of scandal to emerge and take hold. A sterling example is his redefinition of the January 6 assault on the Capitol as \" a day of love ,\" complete with pardons for most of those convicted for their involvement.\n\nThe corrective power of scandal was already weakened during the first Trump term. In those years, Trump did not hide his pursuit of profit while in office, and he made efforts to control the Department of Justice for his own personal and political purposes-though nothing like what we are seeing today. These and other actions of the time ignited major controversies and led to two impeachments, but none entailed revelations of actions he was denying. He proclaimed \"perfect\" the call to the president of Ukraine at issue in the first impeachment, and in the second, his rally and video communications related to the attack on the Capital could not have been more public. After Trump left office, reforms to constrain his version of the presidency were proposed in abundance but went nowhere.\n\nEven where scandal does not yield statutory reform, it can serve to reinvigorate weakened norms. An example that may now seem quaint is the furor over the George W. Bush administration's midterm firing of nine U.S. attorneys. The firing was public; the motive was the stuff of scandal: It emerged that the White House had been deeply involved in the dismissals, acting on concerns that these law-enforcement officials were insufficiently committed to rooting out alleged Democratic Party voting \"fraud.\" The attorney general denied any questionable motivation and agreed that \"it would be improper to remove a U.S. attorney to interfere with or influence a particular prosecution for partisan political gain.\"\n\nBut the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility jointly took up the matter and concluded, \"The Department's removal of the U.S. Attorneys and the controversy it created severely damaged the credibility of the Department and raised doubts about the integrity of Department prosecutive decisions.\" The Office of the Inspector General further judged that there was \"significant evidence that political partisan considerations were an important factor\" in the dismissals. It affirmed that department officials had a \"responsibility to ensure that prosecutorial decisions would be based on the law, the evidence, and Department policy, rather than political pressure.\" In part because of this scandal, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigned .\n\nThis was not all. A special counsel was appointed to consider whether the firings involved any violations of criminal law. She concluded that no violations had occurred but that the law did prohibit some forms of political interference in law enforcement. And she roundly affirmed department \"principles\" against \"undue sensitivity to politics.\" The Obama administration advised Congress of these findings and put a strong emphasis on the point: Its attorney general was committed to \"ensuring that partisan political considerations play no role in law enforcement decisions of the Department.\"\n\nRead: Trump says the corrupt part out loud\n\nThere is little reason to imagine that we would see a \"scandal\" concerned with \"undue sensitivity to politics\" in this presidency. The norms at the center of the U.S.-attorney scandal are not honored even in the breach, because the breach has been transformed into policy. As the legal scholar (and my collaborator on the Substack newsletter Executive Functions ) Jack Goldsmith has noted , the Trump White House's proclaimed policy of avoiding \"'the appearance of improper political influence' in law enforcement is doublespeak for the reality of heavy political influence in law enforcement, just as the Justice Department's ' Weaponization Working Group ,' which builds on Trump's ' Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government ' executive order, is in reality a playbook to weaponize DOJ law enforcement like never before.\" Officials appointed to high positions, including the U.S. attorney in D.C. and both the FBI's director and its recently named deputy director , have appeared eager to investigate those who were involved in investigations of Donald Trump.\n\nIn this environment, there seems to be one potential opening for scandal on the old model: the role of Elon Musk. Some of the elements of scandal are present in this case of a businessman, situated both inside and outside the government, who has been provided with apparently massive but undefined authority. It's never quite clear when Musk speaks for himself, for his businesses, or for the government. The administration has given varying accounts of his role in the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk himself has made the extraordinary claim that voters are at least an indirect source of his authority. Last month, he reposted on X : \"Dems keep saying 'No one elected Elon Musk.' Yes we did. Elon was very visible with Trump and we elected Trump to utilize Elon.\" Polls show that even among Republicans, Musk is a controversial figure. It is not impossible to imagine a reform at some point designed to impose limits, or at least greater accountability and transparency, on a president's use of a private citizen to assume major government functions.\n\nPerhaps the picture for reform even without the propulsive force of scandal will brighten if the administration fails to deliver on issues that bread-and-butter voters care most deeply about and they become less tolerant of \"long live the king\" presidential leadership. Monarchical ambition can founder on the price of eggs and bacon. It can also eventually run aground in conflict with a defining element of American political culture: distrust of government, a belief that it is, as the historian Garry Wills has written, a \" necessary evil , one we must put up with while resenting the necessity.\" Trump's aggressive claim that the president is the law is altogether new, and coming fast at the electorate. Perhaps in this limited time, the voters are waiting and seeing. Trump and his allies may not appreciate that they are testing, and may not prevail over, America's anti-government tradition. After all, they are the government now."

      "text": "Donald Trump, Tesla Salesman\n\nIn promoting Elon Musk's car company, Donald Trump showed just how far he'll go for his allies.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nIn 2023, Donald Trump posted that electric-car supporters should \"ROT IN HELL.\" Now he is showcasing Teslas on the White House lawn. Yesterday, the president stood with Elon Musk and oohed and ahhed at a lineup of the electric vehicles, saying that he hoped his purchase of one would help the carmaker's stock, which had halved in value since mid-December thanks to a combination of customer backlash and general economic uncertainty . (The stock has rebounded by 7.6 percent since yesterday.)\n\nTrump does not own shares in Tesla, as far as we know. He has said that he is supporting the carmaker because protesters are \"harming a great American company,\" and has suggested that people who vandalize Tesla cars or protest the company should be labeled domestic terrorists. But he also seems interested in helping his friend, the special government employee Elon Musk, maintain his status as the wealthiest man in the world. Yesterday's White House spectacle was, my colleague Charlie Warzel wrote , \"a stilted, corrupt attempt to juice a friend's stock, and certainly beneath the office of the presidency.\"\n\nIf any other government official had similarly promoted a friend's product (especially on hallowed White House grounds), they would have been in clear violation of the specific regulation restricting executive-branch employees from using their role to endorse commercial products or services, Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, told me. But the president and the vice president are exempt from that regulation, as well as from some of the other ethics rules that govern federal officials. Norms, in this case, are the primary lever for holding the commander in chief accountable.\n\nTrump has repeatedly demonstrated his appetite for overturning norms and pushing ethical bounds , so his latest stunt as a Tesla salesman is not altogether shocking. When Trump learned in 2016 that U.S. presidents are exempt from the conflict-of-interest rules that restrict other government officials, he seemed delighted. \"The president can't have a conflict of interest,\" he told The New York Times then. \"I'd assumed that you'd have to set up some type of trust or whatever.\"\n\nDespite the lack of legal restriction , modern presidents have generally moved assets into blind trusts , which are controlled by independent managers, in order to diminish any perception that they are profiting from the office (or that they are making policy decisions to boost their own investment portfolios). Trump has shuffled around his assets since taking office but in general has chosen to put his family in charge of managing them. Trump recently said that he'd transferred his shares of Truth Social into a trust controlled by his son Donald Trump Jr., a move that is \"irrelevant from an ethics point of view\" because the money could still flow to him, Clark told me. And with his own family controlling the trust, Trump likely knows exactly where his money is and can make decisions that would increase the value of his holdings.\n\nPresidential conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of them, can undermine public confidence (nearly two-thirds of Americans said they believe that all or most elected officials ran for office to make money, a 2023 Pew Research Center survey found). Trump may not be directly profiting off Tesla, but the problem with him hawking cars poses the same issue as other potential conflicts of interest: What's good for Truth Social or Trump's meme coin or Tesla is not necessarily what's good for the country, and Trump has so far not inspired confidence that he will prioritize the latter.\n\nMusk, too, hasn't assuaged concerns that he will separate his business interests from his role in the Trump administration: Musk's corporate empire relies on government contracts. And the federal firings he is overseeing through his DOGE initiative are already reshaping agencies that regulate his companies.\n\nAfter he sat in the Teslas and complimented them in front of cameras yesterday, Trump told the press that he would buy one of the vehicles and pay with a personal check . That relatively small financial commitment makes a big statement about the president and where his priorities lie: with the interests of his friend, the billionaire.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nToday's News\n\nEvening Read\n\nThe Man Who Owned 181 Renoirs\n\nBy Susan Tallman\n\nOf all the ways that today's plutocrats spend their billions, founding an art museum is one of the more benign, somewhere behind eradicating malaria but ahead of eradicating democracy.

      "text": "Musk Comes for the 'Third Rail of American Politics'\n\nDonald Trump promised to protect Social Security. Elon Musk didn't.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nTwenty years ago, President George W. Bush's second-term honeymoon was ending, and Social Security was to blame. Voters rebelled against his plan to partially privatize the popular retirement program and, the following year, stripped the GOP of its majorities in Congress. The events of 2005 cemented Social Security's reputation as the \" third rail of American politics .\" For the next two decades, Republicans didn't touch it.\n\nPerhaps Elon Musk wasn't paying attention. Back then, he had yet to vote in a U.S. election (or launch a rocket). Now, as a leader of DOGE, he's opened an unexpected crusade against Social Security.\n\nMusk recently called the program \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time\" and claimed that it's rife with waste and fraud. DOGE staffers have gained entry to the Social Security Administration and obtained sensitive taxpayer data, and the Trump administration has cut the agency's workforce by thousands. Earlier this week, Social Security officials announced changes that could make it harder for retirees to access their benefits. These moves-and Musk's rhetoric-have frightened voters, who have jammed congressional phone lines and town-hall meetings to register their concerns. And they've alarmed GOP lawmakers, who could pay for Musk's decisions in next year's midterms.\n\nRead: The GOP's fears about Musk are growing\n\nIf Musk wants to meet his goal of cutting $1 trillion in federal spending, he'll have to do a lot more than eliminate USAID, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and even the Department of Education. He knows the real money is in the three pillars of America's social safety net: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. \"Most of the federal spending is entitlements,\" he said earlier this month. \"That's the big one to eliminate.\"\n\nRepublicans have learned that going after these programs carries a huge electoral risk. Musk, apparently, has not. \"He doesn't think politically,\" Tom Davis, a former House Republican from Virginia who ran the party's campaign committee in the early 2000s, told me. His approach, Davis said, is \"ready, fire, aim.\"\n\nMusk has \"been quite successful in business, but he is clearly not very popular, and his DOGE actions are making him less popular,\" a senior GOP strategist told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid provoking a fight with the president or his wealthy lieutenant. \"He will end up being a heavy weight around the neck of not only President Trump but Republicans generally.\"\n\nMost elected Republicans have been careful to avoid criticizing Trump or Musk. But as DOGE has continued to assail Social Security, some have started feeling pressure from their constituents. Callers inundated Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan with concerns about Social Security cuts during a telephone town hall the Republican held earlier this month. He assured them the program would not be touched. \"I will admit that there have been times where Elon Musk has tweeted first and thought second,\" Huizenga told me, summarizing his message to constituents.\n\nTrump might be able to claim a mandate from voters to justify some of his early cost cutting; he's long criticized foreign aid , for example. But during the 2024 presidential campaign, he repeatedly vowed to preserve entitlements, even when some in his party wanted to trim them. Republicans have relied on those promises to try to reassure voters that their benefits are safe. \"I think President Trump has made it very clear that he does not want to touch Social Security,\" Representative Glenn Grothman of Wisconsin, a Trump ally, told reporters at the Capitol last week. \"We are not cutting Social Security.\"\n\nMusk's offensive against Social Security, however, has made those claims harder to sustain. And Trump himself has amplified some of Musk's most specious charges about the program. During the president's address to Congress earlier this month, he said his administration had identified \"shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud\" in Social Security. But the examples he cited-people born in the 19th century supposedly still getting checks-were almost certainly data-processing errors that reflected the program's antiquated computer systems , not fraud.\n\nRead: What Trump and Musk want with Social Security\n\nThe administration's attempts to reduce fraud could jeopardize legitimate recipients. Beginning next month, people will no longer be able to call the Social Security Administration to file for benefits or update their banking information. Instead they'll have to do so on the agency's website or-if they can't verify their identity online-visit an SSA office in person. The new requirements could be a particular hardship for older beneficiaries who live in rural areas-a constituency that leans heavily Republican.\n\n\"If they kill the ability to phone Social Security with questions, that will cause real problems with seniors,\" the GOP strategist warned. \"This would give Democrats an opening.\"\n\nPolling backs up the strategist's claims. In a survey released yesterday, the Democratic firm Blueprint read respondents a list of 20 different facts about Musk and what he has done with DOGE, then asked which ones they found concerning. The four examples that respondents worried about most all involved possible cuts to Social Security. \"This is what Democrats need to get through their heads: It's all Social Security right now,\" Evan Roth Smith, Blueprint's pollster, told reporters during a briefing.\n\nWhat Trump and Musk are doing now is far different from what Bush proposed two decades ago. His plan called for structural changes to Social Security that would allow recipients to put their benefits into private investment accounts, which Bush argued could yield more earnings for beneficiaries while extending the fiscal solvency of the program. Davis was serving in the House when the public rejected Bush's idea. He offered a reminder that Trump and Musk might want to consider: \"When you move too far, too fast in politics,\" Davis said, \"the voters pull you back.\""

Hopefully we won't have to use it for that purpose, but you have to have it, and if it ever happens, they won't know what the hell hit them.\"\n\nTrump made the announcement from the Oval Office with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his side. Hegseth claimed the new jet will ensure America's air dominance for future generations.\n\n\"America is going to have generations in the future of air dominance because of this sixth generation fighter,\" Hegseth declared, adding that this \"sends a very direct, clear message to our allies, that we're not going anywhere, and to our enemies, that we will be able to project power around the globe unimpeded for generations to come.\"\n\nThe new aircraft will be manned, like its predecessors, and will \"serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nTrump joked the jet's build is so secretive, the military decided against showing a clear photo of it at Friday's announcement. Instead, a poster board offered a glimpse at its cockpit and landing gear.\n\nCritics have questioned whether such a program is necessary as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most-advanced jet, the F-35, reported the AP.

District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander ruled that Social Security officials are barred from sharing Americans' personal information with DOGE staffers and its \"affiliates\" for two weeks.

Dudek told the Post that government attorneys will file an affidavit asking Hollander to clarify language in her ruling, which he criticized as being \"ambiguous,\" \"overly broad\" and \"weirdly written.\" If she is unable to clear things up, Dudek threatens he will \"just start to shut it down,\" referring to SSA, adding that he does not \"have much of a choice here.\"\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Trump Gets Law Firm He Targeted With Executive Order to Do Free Work for Him\n\nDonald Trump announced Thursday that he was rescinding his executive order against a law firm that sued alleged Jan. 6 rioters, but with several catches, among them that the firm must do $40 million of free work for the administration.\n\nLast Friday, Trump's order rescinded federal government contracts held by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. The order cited a pro bono suit against suspected Jan. 6 rioters and the re-hiring of Mark Pomerantz, who worked in the Manhattan's district attorney's office during its investigation of Trump, as cause for presidential action. The order also accused the Manhattan firm of race and gender discrimination.\n\nIn addition to revoking contracts, Trump ordered the same for firm members' active security clearances.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was amid those drastic measures that Trump announced that he was able to extract considerable value from the firm in exchange for dropping the order.\n\nIn his statement on Truth Social, Trump said in part that the firm \"will take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society, whether 'conservative' or 'liberal.'\"\n\nHe continued that it will \"not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies,\" and, most stunningly, \"will dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump's term to support the Administration's initiatives, including: assisting our Nation's veterans, fairness in the Justice System, the President's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, and other mutually agreed projects.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Perkins Coie, another firm in Trump's crosshairs via executive order, sued the administration , claiming the presidential act was \"an affront to the Constitution and our adversarial system of justice.\"\n\n\"Its plain purpose is to bully those who advocate points of view that the president perceives as adverse to the views of his administration, whether those views are presented on behalf of paying or pro bono clients,\" the suit stated. \"Perkins Coie cannot allow its clients to be bullied.\"\n\nwilliam.vaillancourt@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

She owes me a totally discredited Pulitzer Prize for her bad reporting.\"\n\nTrump yelled: \"The Fake News is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE...And Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!\"\n\nMusk also addressed The Times' report that he would be briefed on the nation's China war plans. He said on X on Friday that he looked forward to \"the prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information to NYT.\"\n\n\"The New York Times is pure propaganda,\" he added.\n\nFreelance Writer\n\nGot a tip?

A spokesperson for DHS, which is under the leadership of Kristi Noem , claimed to Bloomberg the office was impeding immigration enforcement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS' mission,\" spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.\n\nThe office was created as part of the 2002 Homeland Security Act. Migrant Insider reports that 90 federal workers from the office have now lost their jobs and will be paid through May 23.\n\nAn official told Bloomberg the office was integral to revealing the scope of family separation and reunification issues during Trump's first White House stint.\n\nAlso axed on Friday, according to Bloomberg, was the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman-an independent group within DHS that Congress established in 2019 \"to promote safe, humane conditions\" in immigration detention.\n\nMcLaughlin claimed the office, created after allegations of inhumane conditions at detention facilities in Trump's first term, had \"misused taxpayer funds by facilitating complaints that encourage illegal immigration.\"\n\nScott Shuchart, a former official in the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, told Bloomberg it was \"dangerous\" to ax his former office while immigrant detention is ramping up.\n\n\"People die in ICE custody,\" he emphasized. \"People die in CBP custody.\"\n\nThe office closures are likely chilling for migrants like Jerce Reyes Barrios and his family.\n\nBarrios, a professional soccer player from Venezuela, was among the 261 individuals who were abruptly deported to El Salvador over the weekend for allegedly being affiliated with the Tren de Aragua gang.\n\nBarrios' attorney has insisted he has no affiliation with the Venezuelan gang. She says he was singled out because he threw up a common hand gesture in a selfie-which means \"I love you\" in sign language-and had a tattoo on his arm that was inspired by his favorite soccer team, Real Madrid.\n\nThe attorney added that Barrios was sent to a foreign prison-without counsel or family being alerted-despite him entering the U.S. legally and having no criminal record or removal order. The 36-year-old father has an asylum hearing scheduled in the U.S. for next month, his attorney said, because he was tortured by the dictator Nicolas Maduro's regime for attending a demonstration against it.\n\nLoved ones of others sent to El Salvador-where reports say their heads were promptly shaved and all communication denied-have also alleged due process was skipped.\n\nThe federal district judge James Boasberg agreed with those claims. He ordered the deportation flight to be called off on Saturday, but the flight was already in the air and DHS officials claimed it was too late to turn the plane around.\n\nA legal battle over the deportations to El Salvador is still playing out in court.\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Since returning to office in January, Trump has already slashed the Education Department's workforce in half and cut $600 million in grants. Education journalist Jennifer Berkshire says despite Trump's claims that he is merely returning power and resources to the states, his moves were previewed in Project 2025. \"The goal is not to continue to spend the same amount of money but just in a different way; it's ultimately to phase out spending ... and make it more difficult and more expensive for kids to go to college,\" Berkshire says. She is co-author of the book The Education Wars: A Citizen's Guide and Defense Manual and host of the education podcast Have You Heard .\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Trump signed an executive order Thursday to start dismantling the Department of Education, though the agency can't be formally shut down without congressional approval. Since taking office, Trump has already slashed the department's workforce in half and cut $600 million in grants. Trump's executive order instructs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin shutting down the agency.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : My administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department. We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It's doing us no good. We want to return our students to the states, where just some of the governors here is so happy about this. They want education to come back to them, to come back to the states. And they're going to do a phenomenal job.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For the signing ceremony, Trump created a fake classroom inside the White House, flanked by schoolchildren sitting at desks. They were given fake executive orders to sign, as well.\n\nMany groups have criticized the move to shut down the department. Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said, quote, \"Let's be clear: Before federal oversight, millions of children - particularly those with disabilities and those from our most vulnerable communities - were denied the opportunities they deserved,\" she said. Gerald Griggs, the president of Georgia's NAACP , also criticized Trump's move.\n\nGERALD GRIGGS : Everybody says they want to support children, they have a right to life. But what happens after they're born? They have to be educated. And if you're cutting the Department of Education, whose sole purpose is to provide a quality education for all of Americans, but particularly those that are in public schools, I think this is ill-fated and will be very detrimental to this state and the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The White House says several critical programs will continue, including student loans and federal Pell Grants.\n\nWe go now to Gloucester, Massachusetts. We're joined by Jennifer Berkshire, co-author of the book The Education Wars: A Citizen's Guide and Defense Manual . She's also host of the education podcast Have You Heard . Her recent piece for The Baffler is headlined \"Cruel to Your School: Trump's war on public education.\"\n\nJennifer Berkshire, thanks so much for being with us. Why don't you start off by explaining what the Department of Education does?\n\nJENNIFER BERKSHIRE : Well, first of all, thanks so much for having me.\n\nAnd when it comes to the Department of Education, it's so easy to venture into the weeds and to get lost in those programs and the acronyms. But when you quoted Keri Rodrigues, she was exactly right. Those programs, things like Title I, they were set up in order to smooth out the vast disparities that we've long had in this country, the disparities between kids based on race, where they live. And so, the Department of Education provides 10% of education funding around the country, primarily to low-income schools and rural schools.\n\nAnd when you think about the real focus of the efforts of the Trump administration to weed out what they would call woke or DEI , this is really it. It's anything that the government does to make the country more equal. That's why they're going straight at these programs, and it's also why public education as an institution is so vulnerable right now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about children with disabilities. You know, there's the whole discussion of DEI , of diversity, equity and inclusion, but it really actually is DEIA - diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility. Can you explain, Jennifer?\n\nJENNIFER BERKSHIRE : Yes, absolutely. So, people don't realize just how recent it is in this country that students with disabilities are guaranteed the right for a free and appropriate education. You can still meet people who came of age in the '70s and had, you know, siblings who didn't have - a school could just turn them away because they had a disability. And because we have a law on the books called IDEA - Linda McMahon did not know what it stands for, but it is the Individual with Disabilities Education Act. And so, basically, students have a right, that's enforced through the Department of Education.\n\nAnd so, it's no coincidence at all that in those layoffs that you mentioned, they went really hard at the division that enforces civil rights. The overwhelming majority of civil rights complaints are from parents who are seeking services and access for kids with disabilities. And basically, the department is saying now, \"You know what? We are no longer going to enforce your right. Instead, we're going to turn what's left of our civil rights division into a sort of a weaponized lean machine that goes after alleged acts of antisemitism,\" and then also things that they suspect of having to do with gender ideology.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Trump vowing to fully preserve popular programs like Pell Grants?\n\nJENNIFER BERKSHIRE : That was a real tell, I thought, that you heard him talk about preserving programs that the Department of Education now oversees, things like Title I and funding for special education and Pell Grants, because he knows that getting rid of these programs would be very politically unpopular. And so he's sort of talking about it in the same way that they're talking about Social Security and Medicare. Like, we see them offstage mucking about, but we're being assured that there won't be any interruption in essential services.\n\nBut as we know from reading the playbook - that would be Project 2025 - the goal is not to continue to spend the same amount of money but just in a different way; it's ultimately to phase out spending. It's to privatize the loan portfolio and make it more difficult and more expensive for kids to go to college. And these are things that I think are really unpopular with American voters across party lines, which is why you don't hear the Trump folks really, you know, admitting where their ultimate destination is.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jennifer Berkshire, how does this executive order fit into the broader war on public education?\n\nJENNIFER BERKSHIRE : It was really telling to see who Trump picked to join him in that weird scene where he signed the order. So, you have the kids at the desk, but then you have some of his favorite governors. Now, why are they his favorite governors? Because they are all in states that either have or are in the process of implementing what are called universal school vouchers. So, this means that the state now picks up the tab for parents to send their kids to private religious schools. And most importantly, like, that money is not going to pay the cost of kids who are leaving public schools. It's now going to pay the tuition for parents who already send their kids to private religious schools, which means that increasingly, in states like Ohio and Indiana, you have the government paying for the very wealthy to send their kids to private religious schools.\n\nSo, why would this be your vision? Because if Trump had wanted to assemble, you know, like, the states that are doing the best on, say, standardized tests, this would not be the crew you'd have. Right? Florida was so unhappy with how it fared on the latest round of what we call the Nation's Report Card that the secretary of education wrote to complain that the test was rigged. And think about somebody like Indiana, your governors there. Indiana stopped investing in public education, K-12 and higher education, 15 years ago. And as a result, college attendance has plummeted, and the state is doing really poorly economically. I think it's actually very indicative of where Trump sees us heading, which is to a sort of a meaner, less prosperous, more divided and inequitable future. And you saw it right there on that weird set.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And how this relates to Project 2025 and Christopher Rufo, Jennifer?\n\nJENNIFER BERKSHIRE : Yeah. So, there, basically, they have laid out the playbook. And it's really important to pay attention to what they've been telling us all along. I see so many commentators scratching their heads, wondering, you know, \"What are they up to? Why are they focused on these programs?\" But we've got, say, a Christopher Rufo out there saying that his goal is to see the percentage of kids who attend college drop by half. Right? That tells you something about the vision that's out there.\n\nWhen Trump talks about returning education to the states, he's talking about the vision that was laid out in Project 2025. And that is really sending funding back to the states in the form of block grants that they can do whatever they want with. Well, we know what they want to do with the money, because we saw who was on that stage yesterday. They want to devote an increasing percentage of their education dollars to private and religious schools that don't have to accept all kids. It's a real step backwards, and it's one that I think that we should all reject.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, what causes you most alarm as President Trump shutters - promises to shutter the Department of Education, though somehow needs congressional approval at the very end?\n\nJENNIFER BERKSHIRE : What gives me most alarm is what a poor job the Democrats have been doing speaking up on behalf of public education as an institution and reminding us why we need it and what we stand to lose when it disappears. And I'm hoping that as we start to possibly see some signs of life among the Democrats, that they will lean into this issue. So, that both gives me hope, but it also causes me not a slight amount of despair right now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jennifer Berkshire, co-author of The Education Wars: A Citizen's Guide and Defense Manual . We'll link your new article in The Baffler , \"Cruel to Your School: Trump's war on public education.\"\n\nComing up, an update on Mahmoud Khalil.

But first we talk about the Supreme Court. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nSupreme Court Justice John Roberts has issued a rare statement Tuesday criticizing calls by President Trump and his allies to impeach federal judges that rule against him. Chief Justice Roberts wrote, quote, \"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" unquote.\n\nChief Justice Roberts' statement came after Trump repeatedly attacked U.S. District Judge - that's federal judge - James Boasberg, who ordered the Trump administration to stop using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants. It has only been used three times before in U.S. history, and those times during war. On Saturday, the administration ignored Boasberg's order to turn around three deportation flights bound for a maximum-security privately run prison in El Salvador.\n\nIn one social media post, Trump called for the impeachment of Boasberg, who he described as, quote, \"Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge\" and \"a troublemaker and an agitator.\" Now, this is the federal judge who ordered the release of Hillary Clinton's emails, just to give you a sense of who Boasberg is.\n\nNumerous Trump officials have openly threatened to defy court orders. This is Trump's so-called border czar Tom Homan speaking on Fox News.\n\nTOM HOMAN : I'm proud to be a part of this administration. We're not stopping. I don't care what the judges think. I don't care what the left thinks. We're coming.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : White House adviser Stephen Miller appeared on CNN Monday and said Judge Boasberg had no authority to make his ruling on the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.\n\nSTEPHEN MILLER : This judge violated the law. He violated the Constitution.\n\nKASIE HUNT : So, again - so, do you think -\n\nSTEPHEN MILLER : He defied -\n\nKASIE HUNT : - that the White House is above federal -\n\nSTEPHEN MILLER : - the system of government that we have in this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : During a hearing on Monday, Judge Boasberg accused the administration of adopting an approach of, quote, \"We don't care, we'll do what we want,\" unquote.\n\nThis all comes as the Trump administration continues to face more setbacks in court. On Monday, a federal judge blocked President Trump's transgender military ban. Another federal judge ruled Elon Musk's efforts to dismantle USAID likely violated the Constitution in multiple ways. Trump responded to the Musk ruling on Fox News.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : We will be appealing it. We have rogue judges that are destroying our country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As fears of a constitutional crisis grow, we're joined by Elie Mystal, The Nation 's justice correspondent. His new piece is headlined \"Trump Is Trying to Create His Own Personal Legal Strike Force.\" Elie is also author of the upcoming book, Bad Law: Ten Popular Laws That Are Ruining America .\n\nElie, thanks for coming back to Democracy Now! What is happening right now with this presidential attack on judges?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : We live in a fascist dictatorship. That's what's happening right now. That's what it feels like. This is where we are. There is not a coming constitutional crisis; we are in the constitutional crisis right now. Because what do we have - how can we call ourselves a democracy, how can we call ourselves a nation of laws, if one man, and one man alone, Donald Trump, is able to defy the other two branches of government? That's what we have here. And that's what Trump promised to do, and that's what he is, in fact, doing.\n\nAmy, you played the clip - you mentioned John Roberts's statement, and you rightly pointed out that it is rare for John Roberts to say anything at all. But let's look at what the man said, and let's look at what the man didn't say, right? It was one of the weakest statements that he could have possibly made. He's running around with his - you know, clutching his pearls over, like, \"Don't impeach federal judges. That's wrong.\" He didn't say nothing about actually following the orders given by those federal judges that Roberts doesn't want impeached, right? He didn't say anything about Trump's blatant violation of multiple federal court orders. He didn't say anything about that at all.\n\nSo, again, Roberts is not your friend. Roberts is not the one coming to help us. He's as afraid as - I believe that Roberts is as afraid of Trump as the rest of the government is. And that's, again - I don't know any definition of fascist dictatorship other than the one we are all experiencing right now.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Elie, in terms of the qualitative difference between the current situation and past confrontations between the executive branch and the courts, of course, back in the 1800s, there was a famous battle between Andrew Jackson and the Supreme Court over the relative sovereignty of the Native American peoples, and FDR had his conflicts with the court. But this is, as you say, multiple federal judges all around the country coming up, ruling against the Trump administration. What's your sense of the difference between this and all prior historical battles?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Well, here, the Trump administration is directly saying - you just played that ghoul Stephen Miller directly saying that the federal judges don't have authority over this administration. Right? So, that's number one. That's the biggest break from the past. They're not even pretending to acknowledge the authority of the federal judiciary to restrain or control this administration, right? So, that's number one.\n\nNumber two, when you look at those historical examples, you're talking, for the most part, about military funding, right? You're talking about, you know, Andrew Jackson saying the judges made this order, now let him enforce it, as he's committing genocide against the Native Americans. You're talking about Teddy Roosevelt sending the Navy halfway out into the Pacific and saying, like, \"Congress, I'm sure you will fund them to bring them back, won't you?\" You're talking about the executive branch executing its large control - you know, the commander-in-chief exercising his large control over the American military. This ain't that. Right? This isn't a military situation.\n\nThis is Congress-appointed money for USAID , put the money back on - turn the money back on, and Trump saying, \"No, I ain't. Absolutely not.\" This is a judge saying, \"Turn the planes around and bring those people back,\" and Trump saying, \"Nope, won't do that, either.\" This is straight-up - again, this is straight-up authoritarianism. This is straight-up one man's and one man's whim alone controls the country. As you played, you've got his border czar out there literally saying he's not going to respect judicial opinions. You've got Stephen Miller saying that. You've got Trump saying that. And that's what's different from the past.\n\nIf anybody thinks that there's a equivalency here, I will just - I'd like to just remind people that I am old enough to remember when the Supreme Court unconstitutionally, in my mind, outlawed abortions. I'm old enough to remember that. I'm old enough to remember President Joe Biden not - not - going into Texas and being like, \"Abortions for everybody!\" Right? I remember Joe Biden respecting the Supreme Court's ridiculous order when it came to a woman's right to choose. And so, I would just contrast Biden's restraint when it came to judges versus what we're seeing from the Trump administration.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I also wanted to ask you about Trump's weaponizing of the Justice Department, even though he claims the Justice Department was weaponized against him. In his speech last week at the Great Hall at the Justice Department, he said, quote, \"As the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\" And he was there with the head of the FBI , Kash Patel, and Attorney General Pam Bondi in attendance.\n\nELIE MYSTAL : Yeah, I mean, this is - again, this is Trump doing what he promised to do. This is a dictator acting like a dictator, right? This is a man personally taking control of the law enforcement apparatus of the United States to go after his political enemies. That's what he promised to do. That is, in fact, what he's doing. I'm surprised people are surprised. What did you think the man was going to do? Follow the law? He even promised to do that. So, like, why are people surprised that he's not doing it now, right?\n\nHe went to the DOJ - and, look, Juan, to be clear, I don't have any pearls to clutch. I'm not one of these people who's like, \"Oh god! He talked to the attorney general! Why?\" even though, again, if we're going to look historically, there is supposed to be a wall of separation between the DOJ and the president of the United States. Again, to go back to Joe Biden, he wouldn't even call Merrick Garland to follow up on whether or not he was doing anything about the people who attacked the Capitol on January 6th.\n\nBut putting that aside, Trump went to the DOJ to declare, to announce, to confirm that he intends to use the Department of Justice to go after his political enemies, especially the lawyers. Trump called out a number of lawyers during that speech - Jack Smith, Andrew Weissmann, Norm Eisen - specifically saying that he is going to use his lawyers at the DOJ - because they're his now, not ours. They work for him, not the people of the United States of America. Trump made that entirely clear. He's going to use his lawyers to go after the lawyers he believes stand up and oppose him. That was the upshot of his speech at the Department of Justice.\n\nAnd what did Pam Bondi do? What did Kash Patel do? They sat there, and they clapped like seals. They clapped like the good little sycophants they are. And we can assume that they will carry out Trump's unlawful, lawless orders to bring political prosecutions against the lawyers that Trump believes oppose him.\n\nHe said at one point during that speech, \" CNN and MSDNC write 97.6% bad about me.\" Grammatically, that's normal Trump. But politically and legally, he's saying that you should be able to go after the media for writing bad things about him. Again, if this isn't authoritarianism, if this isn't dictatorship, if this isn't fascism, than I don't know what those words mean.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Elie Mystal, I wanted to ask you about the judge's rulings that the administration directly defied. You have the case of the detainees being sent to El Salvador to a supermax prison, when the judge directly said, \"Turn those planes around.\" And there was one still on the tarmac. And you have the case of Dr. Rasha Alawieh, the Brown University professor, the kidney specialist. Another judge said she is not to be deported. They deported her anyway. If you can respond to these two cases, and then the case of Mahmoud Khalil, who is now calling himself a political prisoner? He's in an ICE detention facility in Jena, Louisiana. He was one of those who protested the U.S. support for the Israeli war on Gaza. Can you talk about all of this?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : So, Amy, people have told me from the jump, from November 5th, when he was elected, that the courts would save us, that the courts would restrain him, that the courts would be the final guardrail preventing his military dictatorship. And I have said from the jump that the courts will not save us, that they cannot save us, because they cannot enforce their own decisions. The executive enforces the courts' decisions. And if you have an executive like Trump who is willing to ignore court orders, then there's nothing courts can do.\n\nSo, part of my question, Amy, is to turn it around back on the other people who were telling me for months that the courts would save us: What do y'all got now? What's your plan now? Now that the courts have issued their order and Trump has ignored their orders, what's plan B? Because plan A was the courts saving us, and that was never going to work.\n\nMy response to Trump violating a court order, violating multiple court orders, is the people have to lead, because the courts will not do it. The courts cannot do it. You want to free Khalil? We need to go to Jena and free Khalil. Like, that's what it takes. It's not going to happen because a judge writes something down on a piece of paper. Trump is just going to ignore it. And we saw that with the Venezuelans that he deported illegally after a court told him to turn the plane around. And we saw it with the doctor, who he deported, what he said, \"too quickly\" for the courts to rule at all.\n\nAnd again, I'll turn it back on John Roberts, who didn't say boo about that. Right? And all the smoke from, like, \"Oh, don't impeach my judges,\" didn't say boo about Trump refusing to turn the planes around, under a direct court order to do so. This is the fascism we are living under. This is what it feels like, folks.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you so much, Elie, for being with us. Elie Mystal is The Nation 's justice correspondent.

Last Monday she was arrested outside her workplace in Colorado by ICE agents who were reportedly \"laughing in her face\" as they took her to the Aurora ICE jail run by the for-profit GEO Group. As this goes to print, she remains locked up, facing deportation.\n\nFor almost 30 years Jeanette Vizguerra has built a life in this country, becoming a well-known organizer and activist for immigrant rights and other social justice causes. Her arrest signals a clear trend targeting activists as part of President Donald Trump's promised mass deportation campaign.\n\nJeanette and her husband and six year-old daughter fled Mexico in 1997 after he was threatened with murder at gunpoint. They settled in Colorado. There she worked as an SEIU labor organizer, volunteered with the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition and the American Friends Service Committee ( AFSC ), and founded the activist organizations Dreamer's Mothers in Action-Colorado, Abolish ICE Denver, and Sanctuary4All. She did all this while working numerous jobs and giving birth to and raising three more children, all born in the US.\n\nIn 2009 she successfully fought deportation following a routine traffic stop. Then, in 2017, during the first Trump administration, she was targeted for deportation, and took sanctuary in a Unitarian church in Denver, living there with her three young children. She received a stay of removal, but then, upon its expiration in 2019, returned to sanctuary. She received additional deportation stays during the Biden administration, but those have expired, leaving her vulnerable to Trump's deportation crusade.\n\nAt a rally on Tuesday, as high winds drove a mix of freezing rain and snow into the crowd of close to 100 supporters rallying outside the walls of the GEO ICE jail in Aurora, Colorado, Jeanette managed to address the crowd by phone from inside. Her daughter Luna held the phone up to a microphone:\n\n\"I'm hopeful I'm going to be able to leave here and continue my fight and for others, because inside here there are many injustices. There are a lot of women whose cases are not being reviewed, and I'm going to try to help them, even being here in detention.\"\n\nTo those who know Jeanette, it comes as no surprise that she was actively organizing inside the prison walls.\n\n\"The reason why they might be targeting Jeanette, she's long been a leader,\" Jennifer Piper of AFSC said on the Democracy Now! news hour. \"She was among the first in the country to make her deportation case public in 2009 and really exposed the cruelty of our deportation machine, which is vast in the United States. No matter who the administration was, Jeanette has always stood and will continue to stand for justice and for dignity for all people.\"\n\nPiper says there's increasing fear among immigrants of the Trump administration \"disappearing\" people.\n\nMargaret Cargioli, an attorney with the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, speaking on Democracy Now!, described the case of an LGBTQ asylum seeker from Venezuela. Only after he failed to arrive at an immigration hearing on Monday did she learn that he had been sent by ICE to El Salvador's notorious supermax \"Terrorism Detention Center,\" or CECOT . Watchdog groups in El Salvador report at least 350 people have died in prisons there since 2022, and torture is reportedly common inside CECOT .\n\n\"We are seriously concerned for his well-being, his safety....There was no order of deportation. There was no order of removal. He was sent there unlawfully. He still has a pending immigration court hearing. It's coming up very soon. And he has a right to seek asylum. What happened here is extremely unusual and concerning.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has invoked the more than two century old 1798 Alien Enemies Act, last used during WWII , to send over 130 Venezuelans alleged to be members of the \"Tren de Aragua\" gang, without evidence, to CECOT .\n\nTrump is using the extreme right-wing government of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele as a brutal detention contractor. As with many of Trump's executive actions, this is being challenged in court. Trump's open defiance of Judge James Boasberg's court order halting use of the 1798 law to round up migrants is pushing the United States into a constitutional crisis.\n\nThe detentions, deportations and disappearances are stoking fear in the immigrant community, which is certainly one of its main objectives.\n\nOne who remains undaunted is Jeanette Vizguerra.\n\n\"Over her entire case, her entire fight...her struggle and her leadership, her community have made the impossible possible,\" the AFSC's Jennifer Piper said.\n\nJeanette Vizguerra should be an example to citizens and non-citizens alike.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

He also responds to Trump's \"illegal\" invocation of the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and his attempt to deport foreign-born university students and faculty. Trump's sweeping efforts to make the United States hostile to immigrants \"creates danger for everybody,\" warns Raskin. Finally, Raskin responds to recent divisions within the Democratic Party over a GOP spending bill. He urges congressional Democrats to present a \"unified plan\" and \"common strategy\" for resisting a Republican supermajority loyal to Trump.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The United States is moving closer to a constitutional crisis as the Trump administration refuses multiple court orders while the president vows to take revenge on political enemies and escalates his attack on the press.\n\nOn Saturday, the U.S. deported 137 Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which was last used to justify the arrest and internment of 30,000 Japanese, German and Italian nationals during World War II.\n\nMeanwhile, Columbia student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil remains locked up in an ICE jail in Louisiana for taking part in student protests against Israel's war on Gaza. A second Columbia student protester has also been arrested.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump spoke at the Department of Justice and threatened to take revenge on his political enemies.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the department of injustice. But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over, and they are never going to come back. They're never coming back. ... So, now as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In a moment, we'll be joined by Democratic Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland, but first let's turn to a part of his response to Trump's speech. Raskin spoke outside the Department of Justice Friday.\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : In the 18th century, the American Revolution overthrew the kings, the lords and the feudal barons to establish a nation where we would have a nation where all would be equal under the law. As Tom Paine put it, in monarchies, the king is law, but in the democracies, the law is king. But, amazingly, we now have a president in the 21st century who believes he's a king, and he believes that the king is the law once again.\n\nThe first seven weeks of this radical experiment in neomonarchism has been a disaster for the rule of law and for the Constitution and for the First Amendment. There have been 120 federal cases filed against Donald Trump all over the country, and he has lost already in more than 40 courtrooms across the land, where temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions have been issued against his lawless attack on the Constitution.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland speaking outside the DOJ on Friday, responding to Trump's speech. He's joining us now from Takoma Park, Maryland. Congressmember Raskin is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and a former constitutional law professor.\n\nDuring Trump's first presidency, Raskin served as a floor manager and the Democrats' lead prosecutor for Trump's second impeachment after the January 6th Capitol insurrection. He was also a member of the House January 6 committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. In January, Biden gave preemptive pardons to Raskin and other members of the January 6th House committee. Earlier today, President Trump claimed the pardons are invalid because, he said, they were done by autopen.\n\nCongressmember Jamie Raskin, welcome back to Democracy Now! Why don't we start there, with President Trump saying all the pardons that he issued that were done by autopen are invalid? That would include you. Your response?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : First of all, thank you for having me, Amy, and that was the first time I got to hear a clip from our press conference. What you couldn't hear there was the constant berating and heckling of MAGA counterprotesters who showed up. We were being drowned out by a guy with a bullhorn. I wanted to borrow his bullhorn, because we didn't have a sound system with us. But I appreciate your running that clip where we went and appeared opposite Donald Trump.\n\nSo, but I had not seen that Donald Trump is claiming that the pardon rendered by President Biden was somehow illegitimate because of the kind of pen that was used. This sounds like classic Donald Trump stuff. You know, the pardons, of course, were necessary because of Trump's promises to prosecute Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney, less so the rest of us, but they had already made their moves against Liz Cheney. And I have no reason to think that those were not valid any more than the humiliating and atrocious pardons that Donald Trump gave to nearly 1,600 insurrectionists, including violent felons who viciously attacked our police officers on January 6th.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you can talk about this almost unprecedented speech? It is very rare for a president to go to the Department of Justice and give a speech like this. I think Clinton did around some anti-crime bill, which many would dispute was actually an anti-crime bill. Obama went to say goodbye to the attorney general. But to give an hour address naming names of targets, talking about the press as enemies of the people, if you can respond, overall, to what he said?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, it was a typical rambling and hate-filled diatribe by Donald Trump. No speech like that has ever taken place at the U.S. Department of Justice, which has existed since 1870, when it was set up to try to enforce the Reconstruction amendments to the Constitution against the Ku Klux Klan and against white supremacists and insurrectionists and secessionists.\n\nBut nobody has ever taken a sledgehammer to the traditional boundary between independent criminal law enforcement, on the one side, and presidential political will and power, on the other. But here Trump made it clear that he views these people as his lawyers. They are reporting to him, according to his corrupt unitary executive theory. And far from staying out of the business of deciding who will be prosecuted and who will be let go, he's going to superintend the whole machinery of the Department of Justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to a clip from President Trump speaking at the Department of Justice.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I believe that CNN and MSDNC , who literally write 97.6% bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they're really corrupt, and they're illegal. What they do is illegal. ... These networks and these newspapers are really no different than a highly paid political operative. And it has to stop. It has to be illegal. It's influencing judges, and it's entered - it's really changing law, and it just cannot be legal. I don't believe it's legal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that is President Trump speaking at the Justice Department. Of course, he has sued ABC . He has sued CBS . He has sued The Des Moines Register . Because he has the backing of the wealthiest person on Earth, Elon Musk, he could do endless lawsuits. And whether or not they win, that's not the point. But he could just wipe out one news institution after another, Congressmember Raskin.\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, he's obviously frustrated because he's losing everywhere in court on everything from the birthright citizenship executive order, which is blatantly unconstitutional, to the spending freeze to the sacking of thousands of probationary employees. And so, he's frustrated, so he says it's got to be illegal for the media to be covering his defeats and to be trying to expose the various constitutional violations of his administration. Of course, it's completely lawful and protected by the First Amendment.\n\nAnd he's just operating out of the authoritarian playbook, which says that the first thing you do when you get in is you crack down on the free press. And he's been doing that in numerous ways. He's been ordering the FCC to go after ABC , CBS , NBC , anybody who displeases him in any way. But he's also been personally suing media entities. There was a shakedown of $15 million against ABC because he was unhappy with coverage there. And now he's got a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS , not even because of anything they said about him, but because he thought that the coverage of Kamala Harris was too positive.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It was about, right, a 60 Minutes interview, which in all news media you do an hour an interview, and you play 10 minutes, so things like her sneezing were taken out. And he said that was used to affect the - try to use to affect the election.\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Of course, Fox News operates completely as an ideological arm of the Republican Party and of the Trump cult, and there's nothing unconstitutional about that. You know, it's totally fine for a newspaper entity to be endorsing Harris or Trump or what have you. So, he's just absolutely confused on the point.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the naming of names, everyone from, oh, Norm Eisen to the organization CREW , that sues over corruption in government, to the Democratic lawyer Marc Elias to the prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, Pomerantz who worked for Alvin Bragg. He named him, as well, the Manhattan DA. What it means for the president of the United States to name check these people and talk about going after them?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, Trump has embarked upon exceedingly unpopular policy moves, including, you know, an $888 billion cut to Medicaid, increasing the tax on Social Security, coming from Elon Musk, gutting federal departments and agencies promoting environmental protection, promoting health research, promoting anti-disease campaigns. And so, the only way to try to protect these maneuvers is to shut down a free press and disable the lawyers who are in court every day holding them to account.\n\nAnd understand, Amy, we are winning in court every single day against the lawlessness, most recently against this completely illegal move to deport people outside of the provisions of immigration law by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which requires that America be at war or be in the midst of an invasion. And we are not being invaded, and the Congress of the United States, which I have the privilege of serving in, has not declared war on Venezuela.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's go into that, Trump invoking that 18th-century law in order to deport Venezuelan nationals from the United States. On Saturday, they flew, the Trump administration, more than 260 immigrants, including 130 people accused, but not convicted, of being a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump has labeled a terrorist organization. The flights came despite a temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ordered any of these deportation flights that were currently in the air to be turned around. One of them was still on the ground. The Washington Post reports the three flights bound for El Salvador arrived after the judge's order. It looks like Salvador, this maximum-security prison, which is ultimately run by the Trump ally Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, guilty of mass human rights abuses - it looks like this judge is holding a hearing today about why they disregarded his ruling. Can you talk about the significance of this? The same thing happened with the Brown University professor, the kidney doctor, who was sent back despite the judge ruling she should be allowed to at least be - her case be heard, and she should not be deported.\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : James Boasberg is an excellent judge in the District of Columbia, federal judge. He's also very conservative. And this is a pattern we note now, that it goes across Democratic and Republican appointees. The same with a bunch of prosecutors who have resigned rather than participate in a corrupt scheme like the effort to absolve and exculpate Mayor Adams.\n\nBut Boasberg's order was completely flouted and violated by the Trump administration and by the president of El Salvador, who gloated and basically mocked the judicial order online, saying, \"Oopsie... Too late.\" And I think that was retweeted by - I think it was Elon Musk who retweeted it with some glee. But, look, you're messing with federal court judges who intervene in a situation like this only when they believe there is imminent harm to people being threatened and when they think that there is a probable likelihood of success on the merits of the case. And I think it was shown, to his satisfaction, that there was all kinds of imminent harm being threatened by these deportations outside of the immigration law system that we've got by invoking the Alien Enemies Act from 1798, which was last used during World War II to round up Japanese and Japanese American citizens in the internment.\n\nAnd so, I don't know. It will be very interesting to see what Judge Boasberg does at this point, because as the president of El Salvador, the corrupt and human rights-violating president of El Salvador, said, \"Oopsie... Too late,\" when it was very clear they had the order to bring those people back and let them go through the normal process. We have no idea who was part of the contingent being deported.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Rubio, the secretary of state, retweeted the \"Oopsie.\" Now I want to ask you about Mahmoud Khalil. There have been mass protests across the country for this Palestinian graduate student who was here on a green card - his wife, eight months pregnant, she is a U.S. citizen - to be released. Can you talk about what's happened to him? He's now still in Louisiana ICE detention. What you're calling for?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, we're calling for respect for the rule of law and for the First Amendment and for due process, and nothing more than that. I would hope, I would assume that people who support the freedom of speech and due process would be saying this is a completely unacceptable situation.\n\nFirst of all, when he was picked up, they were saying that he had a student visa, which he did not. He's a permanent resident, a green card holder, who has all of the same First Amendment rights that a U.S. citizen has. And so, you can disagree with his speech; you can agree with his speech. But in any event, he was picked up for his speech, not given due process under our immigration law system, and then deported and taken out of state. And that's just an intolerable situation.\n\nAnd if it can be done to him, it can be done to every other permanent resident. And indeed, because he's never been charged with anything, there have never been criminal charges, and he's not being charged with anything now, it creates danger for everybody, both noncitizens and citizens alike. And, of course, that's the history of this, Amy. If you go back to the Alien and Sedition Acts from the 1790s, Thomas Jefferson was able to observe, along with other people who were the targets of the Alien and Sedition Acts, that the attack on immigrants very quickly becomes an attack on citizens, as the incumbent party thinks that they're absolutely invulnerable and they can jail people and prosecute people just for being in the political opposition.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, can you talk about some of the things you're calling for, calling on people to submit an open records request to DOGE for your own data, for people's own data, to see what they have on you, like Social Security, student loans, etc., the meaning of this? And your overall, as a constitutional lawyer - the role of the richest man on Earth, of Elon Musk, firing thousands of people, using his own social media platform X to do this? What role does he have in the U.S. government?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, we don't know exactly what role he has. That's an excellent question, because they're very slippery and elusive about this. Sometimes the president describes him as the head of DOGE , as the leader of DOGE . In court, they've said he's not involved in an administrative capacity with DOGE ; he's just an adviser to the president. So we'd like to know.\n\nWe did get this victory in court last week, where a federal judge determined that DOGE is a federal agency, and they cannot slime away from that reality. It is a federal agency. That means that they are subject to FOIA and to the Privacy Act.\n\nAnd I immediately sent in a request for all of the private records of mine, private data of mine, that DOGE has. And under FOIA and under the Privacy Act, we all have that right to find out what information they've got from Social Security, from the Department of Education, if there's college loans, if there's military service. Whatever it might be, all of that belongs to the people since the Privacy Act of 1974. So, I sent it in. I put it up online. I think more than 8,000 or 10,000 people have followed. And we're going to launch a campaign this week, because more than 300 million people have that right, and people need to understand that you've got a right to the data, not Elon Musk and DOGE . And we want to know what's happened to it. Has it gone to his artificial intelligence private business, to Grok? Has it been shared with other third parties? The people have a right to know that.\n\nAnd so, you know, my grandfather was in politics, and he told me when I was a little boy, he said that duck hunting is a lot of fun, until the ducks start shooting back. And I think people are going to insist that our rights be vindicated within American constitutional democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Congressmember Raskin, your comments on what Chuck Schumer, the ranking Democratic member in the U.S. Senate, did, both supporting what was going to be called - the Trump administration threatened to call it the \"Schumer shutdown,\" but, actually, not so much that as having said to the end he would not go along with it, then switching, and the rifts in the Democratic Party now?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, I took a very strong position against that continuing resolution, which was packed with more efforts to dismantle the American social safety net, attacks on Medicaid, attacks on healthcare. And it also provided - and this was very troubling to me - retroactive validation, at least implicitly, of all of the assaults on the federal agencies and on the federal workers. So there was no way I could go along with it. Schumer took an opposite position after different twists and turns in his journey.\n\nBut I've got to say, Amy, what troubled me the most resembled what troubled me the most about what happened to us when Donald Trump showed up for the joint session of Congress. It's that we did not have a unified plan across the House and the Senate within the Democratic Party to decide what to do. And I had said I would stick with any unified plan we had. We could boycott it. We could hold up signs. We could stage a walkout, whatever. But we needed to have a plan. We needed to call a play. And I think that's the real political sin here, that House and Senate Democrats are acting like we occupy different galaxies. We've got to get together and decide what our common front and what our common strategy is. I'm an old, washed-up football quarterback. It's like going out onto the field without any play at all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, do you think Schumer should step down as the ranking Democrat of the Senate?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : You know, they're going to go through that. I think we're going through a period of tremendous upsurge and ferment and change in terms of political leadership across the board. And because we've been so separated, the Senate and the House Democrats, I really know very little about the internal dynamics that led to what took place there. So, I'll reserve judgment on that. But I will say this is a moment where new political leadership is popping up everywhere, and that's all to the good.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, former constitutional law professor, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nComing up, we'll speak to the ACLU , which sued President Trump after he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for the first time since World War II. Back in 30 seconds.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Folk musician Nora Brown with Stephanie Coleman singing \"The Unicorn\" last week at the Kennedy Center. In the middle of their performance, they unfurled banners saying \"Reinstate Queer Programming\" and \"Creativity at the Kennedy Center Must Not Be Suppressed\" in protest of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center.

Let's start off by you responding to President Trump releasing these tens of thousands of pages on the JFK assassination, an attempt to show that the administration is, quote, \"the most transparent administration in history.\" Your thoughts on this and how this all came about?\n\nPETER KORNBLUH : Yeah, there's really three parts to the whole discussion of the JFK papers that have come out this week. One is the content that has been revealed in these long-held secret documents. We are getting to the final secrets that for all these years the CIA and the FBI and others have resisted releasing since the JFK law was passed back in 1992, so many years ago.\n\nAnd that's the second part of the discussion, the law itself, a precedent-setting law forcing the declassification of information, documentation, secrets, that probably would have stayed classified for eternity, had not this law been passed and forced them into the public domain.\n\nAnd the final part of the discussion about these papers is Donald Trump's efforts to politicize and weaponize his decision to finally fully implement the law. He is now casting himself as the transparency president. And, of course, if you look at what he's done during the first two months he's been back in the White House, he's been anything but transparent, and he is systematically shutting down the American public's right to know what is being done in its name, but really without its knowledge.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where does Tulsi Gabbard fit into this picture?\n\nPETER KORNBLUH : Well, she is now the unqualified head of national intelligence. She is director of national intelligence. She's the highest intelligence officer in the country, even overseeing CIA , FBI , NSA , all the intelligence services. She's a coordinator of intelligence.\n\nAnd she came out this week and said that Donald Trump is ushering in a new era of maximum transparency. I mean, this is really one of those alternative facts that we got used to during the first Trump administration, because in these first two months, you know, President Trump has started to simply erase websites that the U.S. government had on various issues, from climate change to education to, you know, to civil rights. He is basically firing the staffs of major information facilities, including the National Archives itself, reducing the ability for us to access historical documents. And, of course, there's much that's going on in secret, and the Freedom of Information Act offices are being reduced, and all the agencies, as well. So, overall, the public's access to information is being gutted, frankly, being challenged by this administration. And, you know, the release of the JFK documents has proved beneficial for him to spin the idea that he's all about openness and transparency.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I'm wondering if you can talk about who DCI John McCone is and his involvement in everything from the Vatican to \"the Agency's covert financial support to political parties in the fight against communism,\" unquote.\n\nPETER KORNBLUH : John McCone was a very famous, accomplished businessman. He was on the board of ITT , one of the biggest corporations in the world in the early '60s. After the failure of the Bay of Pigs, John F. Kennedy fired the Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles, basically pushed him to retire, and Kennedy appointed John McCone in his place to be director of central intelligence. So, McCone shows up in a lot of these documents that have been declassified, because he was director of central intelligence at the time of the Kennedy assassination, and many of the documents are from that era, 1961 through 1963, '64, '65. So, a number of the documents are there.\n\nAnd one of the great documents that my organization, the National Security Archive, posted this week is a document from what was called the \"Family Jewels,\" reports from inside the CIA on the CIA's own misconduct and criminality from the early 1970s. And one of McCone's top aides, Walter Elder, wrote a document, a report to Director William Colby in 1973, that kind of recounted all the questionable misconduct that he was aware of. And among that, the revelations in that document that came out this week, was that John McCone was involved in various communications with the Vatican that, according to Elder, would raise eyebrows, could and would raise eyebrows, according to the document, and that he was in touch with two popes during those years. This opens the door to kind of a whole history that is unknown of CIA connections to the Vatican and to what degree the Vatican was assisting CIA covert operations around the world. And that is a history that really is unknown and begs for revelation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about what you learned about Cuba in the Kennedy assassination files that have been released? I mean, you who knows so much about it. What really shocked you and surprised you in these tens of thousands of pages, if you've gotten through all of them or most of them?\n\nPETER KORNBLUH : Well, nothing shocked me or surprised me, because we already have an extraordinarily infamous history that we know about, deriving mostly from the Church Committee investigations of the mid-1970s. And many of those documents that the Church Committee saw on Cuba, on efforts to assassinate Castro, on covert operations against Cuba, you know, many of those are included in this Kennedy collection, because Cuba was, you know, identified by the right-wingers as part of the conspiracy against Kennedy. And then, on the left, you know, the idea was that the CIA killed Kennedy because he abandoned them at the Bay of Pigs. But all the conspiracy theories have Cuba in the middle of them, one way or another, so a lot of the Cuba documents were included in the JFK collection.\n\nAnd we've learned, you know, new details. We've learned how the CIA goes about contaminating a boatload, a cargoload of sugar exports from Cuba to the USSR , how they managed to get into a warehouse where the sugar was stored before it was being loaded on the boat, contaminated 800 bags, and wrote about in its reports on its successes against Cuba, you know, how this entire expensive load of sugar would get to the USSR , and when it was all put together, it would be completely ruined. And everybody who drank sugar or used it in their coffee or put it in their meals would hate it. And this would, you know, basically destroy Cuba's ability to send sugar to the USSR . I mean, those are incredibly interesting details.\n\nWe've learned that many countries, that we didn't know about, were supporting secretly CIA covert operations against Cuba. And that's going to be very important -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Which countries, Peter?\n\nPETER KORNBLUH : Well, the countries ranged from Canada to Mexico to Greece and Spain and England and a number of others. You know, again, this is old history from the early '60s, but it certainly will be interesting for, you know, the citizens of those countries to know that history and perhaps push to learn more about it from their own governments.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Peter, can you talk about how Oliver Stone's movie blockbuster JFK led to Congress passing the 1992 JFK Act, and how your organization, the National Security Archive, played a role in sorting through the millions of documents that have been released since then about JFK's assassination?\n\nPETER KORNBLUH : You know, the JFK Act, Records Act, is so important, and I can't stress this enough. It should be a precedent, should be a model for other major declassifications of collections of documents. And the entire law and the whole ability of us to access these documents today derives from a conspiracy-laden movie that Oliver Stone made in the early 1990s simply called JFK . Many of your audience, many in your audience, I'm sure, saw the movie.\n\nThe movie was about a district attorney in New Orleans, James Garrison, and his efforts to prosecute a local businessman there for killing JFK , and then his expansion of his conspiracy theories to include the CIA and the FBI . His efforts to prosecute people there led to, I think, the suicide of one of the defendants and the acquittal, in like less than an hour, of another defendant.\n\nAnd so, it was all bogus. It was just a malicious, cruel and baseless prosecution. But conspiracy theorists kind of, you know, found it compelling, and Oliver Stone thought it was good enough to cast Kevin Costner as James Garrison and make a whole movie about it.\n\nAt the very end of the movie, a scroll comes up on the dark screen saying that none of the documents relating to the investigation of Kennedy and the Kennedy assassination have been declassified and that there were an estimated 5 million pages that were still secret after 30 years. And this outraged the American public. I mean, I think the movie captured the conspiracy-minded sense that, you know, secrecy was bad, and something was being hidden about who really killed John Kennedy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Because at the time, it was 30 years after the assassination.\n\nPETER KORNBLUH : Yes, it was just short of 30 years after the assassination when the movie came out. That's right. And, you know, it was incomprehensible that the secrecy was still there. In fact, the secrecy itself was contaminating the American public, society, our institutions. There was no confidence in government, very similar to what we have now that's being stoked by President Trump.\n\nAnd so, to try and rebuild the confidence, the Congress realized that it had to be transparent and pass a law that really forced the declassification, the full declassification, of these documents, millions of pages, creating an independent board to oversee them, defining a Kennedy assassination-related record in very broad terms, that has led to including all these CIA and FBI records that we might not otherwise have seen. And, you know, this is extremely important. It has yielded so much incredible information. It literally has lifted the shroud of secrecy over CIA covert operations around the world in a way that we never would have learned about without this particular law.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Peter Kornbluh, if you could give Trump a list of government documents that you want to see declassified, what would be some of the top documents you want out?\n\nPETER KORNBLUH : Well, we'd like to see declassified, at least in part, all the documents that he took when he left office after his first term, that he took to Mar-a-Lago and that he attempted to keep, even after the U.S. government, the National Archives, had asked him to return them. We would like to see the -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And he apparently, by the way - you heard that he apparently took those documents back now and sent them back to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPETER KORNBLUH : Yes, they've been returned to him, and which, in itself, raises a lot of issues, legal issues, about highly classified records being not secure at his estate in Florida.\n\nWe would like to know about what his conversations with Vladimir Putin were about. You'll remember an incident where he had a private conversation in Europe with Putin, and the interpreter was there, and he took the interpreter's notes afterwards and walked off with them. We would like those notes. We would like any memcons, memoranda of conversation, of all the conversations he's had with Vladimir Putin.\n\nWe would certainly like to see many of the discussions that he had in the Oval Office about January 6th, both before, during and after. There's quite a record.\n\nIn my case, I would like to see the documents that he used to put Cuba on the terrorism list, which - where it doesn't belong. I think those were politicized. And someday we'll get those declassified, I hope.\n\nAnd, of course, we'd like to know about his, you know, covert policies, and we'd like to know what's going on today vis-à-vis covert operations against Cuba and Venezuela and many other countries.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Peter Kornbluh, I want to thank you so much for spending this time, senior analyst for Latin America at the National Security Archive, co-editor of the recent report , \" CIA Covert Ops: Kennedy Assassination Records Lift Veil of Secrecy.\" We will link to your piece coming out in The Nation magazine today. And if you want to see Part 1 of our discussion with Peter, go to democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.

The Impeach Trump Again campaign is being led by the advocacy group Free Speech for People. \"This president has already committed multiple abuses of power since assuming the presidency, and the framers designed the Constitution to ensure that we would not have a monarch or a tyrant govern this nation,\" says the group's president, John Bonifaz. \"When we see these abuses of power, we have to invoke this impeachment clause.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nMore than a quarter of a million people have signed a petition to support an impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump, who was twice impeached during his first term. The Impeach Trump Again campaign is being led by the group Free Speech for People.\n\nThis comes as Texas Democratic Congressmember Al Green has threatened to soon introduce new articles of impeachment against Trump. Last week, Congressmember Green was removed from the House floor for protesting Donald Trump's congressional address. He was then censured by the House. Green spoke on Democracy Now! on Friday.\n\nREP . AL GREEN : Impeachment is a remedy for a runaway president who believes that there are no guardrails, who believes that the Supreme Court has placed him above the law, and who is now very close to a point where he will not honor court orders. When he does that, Ms. Goodman, he at that point will become a dictator. We are this close. When he goes over that line, that second, that scintilla of a second, he will become a dictator, and we will be under a dictatorship. I refuse to wait until that happens before I act, so I will act in defense of the Constitution and for the people of this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined now by John Bonifaz, president of Free Speech for People, organizing the Impeach Trump Again campaign. During Trump's first term, he co-authored the book The Constitution Demands It: The Case for the Impeachment of Donald Trump .\n\nSo, he was impeached twice during the first term. We're not even talking about a hundred days into his second term. Why, John?\n\nJOHN BONIFAZ : Thank you, Amy, for having me.\n\nWe're launching this campaign because we believe it's critical that we invoke this impeachment clause of the Constitution at this moment in history. This president has already committed multiple abuses of power since assuming the presidency. And the framers designed the Constitution to ensure that we would not have a monarch or a tyrant govern this nation. They set up three coequal branches of government: the Congress, the executive branch, the judiciary. But they also put in this extra guardrail, the impeachment clause, and it's designed to deal with that lawless president who abuses the power of the office.\n\nAnd those multiple abuses of power keep piling up every day. We've documented at ImpeachTrumpAgain.org many of these abuses, including his abuse of the pardon power, where he, on day one, effectively pardoned 1,500 of his fellow insurrectionists who had attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021, to try to stop the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nWe have also documented the way in which he issued an executive order to end birthright citizenship. We know that this is a constitutional right. You cannot erase a part of the Constitution with an executive order. Two separate federal courts have found this to be unconstitutional. But it's also an abuse of power.\n\nHe has usurped the power of Congress by freezing funds that have been duly appropriated by Congress. Only Congress has the power to appropriate funds. And he's gone ahead and frozen those funds. And now courts have demanded that he release those funds, and he's defying those court orders - an attack on the judiciary, an attack on the Congress.\n\nThe list goes on. And the point of impeachment power is to ensure that we do not have this kind of lawlessness coming out of the Oval Office, and that's why we launched this campaign.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: But, John, how do you - how would you respond to critics who, even though they may agree with you on the violations by Trump, say that in the last two impeachments, even when Democrats had a majority in Congress, they could not move forward against Trump; now with Republicans in charge of both houses, this will virtually go nowhere?\n\nJOHN BONIFAZ : Well, Juan, the important point here is to start building the case for why this president must be impeached and removed from public office. The fact is that when we see these abuses of power, we have to invoke this impeachment clause. You know, we know the votes are not going to be there today to start impeachment proceedings. But the point is that we, as a people, must demand that our members of Congress stand up and defend our Constitution at this critical moment in history. We commend Congressman Al Green for standing up and demanding that impeachment proceedings begin against this president. And we believe all members of Congress who still believe in the Constitution and our democracy must stand with him.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in terms of what would be the next steps - let's say you keep building this petition - what would be the - I know Congressman Green has said he would introduce articles of impeachment, but what would be your sense of whether you're having some progress on this issue?\n\nJOHN BONIFAZ : Well, first, we see the progress with the 250,000-plus people who've already joined this campaign in less than two months, signing up at ImpeachTrumpAgain.org . And we want those numbers to continue to grow, and we believe they will.\n\nBut Congressman Green has pledged that he will introduce articles of impeachment, and we're working with him and his office on that. And when he does so, they can be a privileged resolution requiring a floor vote, as he did in 2017. He was the first member of Congress to stand up in the last Trump administration. And we will see those numbers grow, as well. Members of Congress will have to be put on record with a floor vote on articles of impeachment as to where they stand. Do they stand on the side of the Constitution and their oath to protect the Constitution and our democracy, or do they stand on the sidelines in the face of this lawlessness from the Oval Office?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Before you go, John, you're also working on other issues, like abolishing super PACs. I think that Elon Musk has promised to raise something like - or, he's attempting to raise - $100 million for three pro-Trump super PACs. Of course, he could just give that himself, as the world's richest man.\n\nJOHN BONIFAZ : Yes. It's important to remember that super PACs did not get created by the Supreme Court. People think it got created out of Citizens United , and that's not true. Super PACs were created by a federal appeals court ruling out of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which wrongly held that because, in their view, independent expenditures cannot corrupt, that unlimited donations to political action committees cannot corrupt. That's patently untrue, as we now know. Fifteen years after that decision, we see the history of how unlimited donations to super PACs, from the Elon Musks and others, have dominated our elections and corrupted the political process.\n\nSo, we are engaged, with others, in working to abolish super PACs. And the state of Maine recently passed a ballot initiative - 74% of the voters enacted it - to abolish super PACs in their state elections. Professor Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School was a catalyst for this initiative, along with his group Equal Citizens. And we're working with him and the state Attorney General's Office to help defend that critical law and create a new test case for the opportunity to abolish super PACs nationwide.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Axios is reporting Elon Musk has told the White House he plans to give $100 million to President Trump's political operation.\n\nJOHN BONIFAZ : It's rampant corruption. It's absolutely an obscene situation that we have now, where billionaires have this opportunity to dominate our government and our politics. And we have to put an end to it. And abolishing super PACs is one important step forward. And we believe there will be congressional legislation, soon to be introduced, that will deal with that, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the role of Hawaii, what they're doing as a model, as you see it?\n\nJOHN BONIFAZ : So, in Hawaii, the state Senate just unanimously and with bipartisan support passed our model legislation to end multinational corporate spending. This is another whole problem with our system of money in politics, which allows foreign-influenced corporations to now dominate our politics and send, through the corporate form, foreign investment into our politics. So, Hawaii has passed this model legislation that we've been advancing across the country through the state Senate, and now it's on to the White House. And we hope Hawaii will become the next state to pass this law.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : John Bonifaz, we want to thank you for being with us, president of Free Speech for People. The group's petition to Impeach Trump Again has gathered 250,000-plus signatures.\n\nComing up, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has been sent to The Hague after he was arrested under a warrant from the International Criminal Court for committing crimes against humanity.

      "text": "Trump revokes legal status of 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans\n\nMove takes effect on 24 April as president weighs also stripping parole status from some 240,000 Ukrainians in US\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it would revoke the temporary legal status of more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans welcomed into the US under a Biden-era sponsorship process, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register and signed by the homeland security chief, Kristi Noem.\n\nThe order cuts short a two-year \"parole\" program - known as CHNV - under Joe Biden that allowed 532,000 people who had arrived in the US since October 2022 with financial sponsors to obtain two-year work permits to live and work in the US. Noem's notice said they will lose their legal status on 24 April.\n\nThe new policy affects people who are already in the US and who came under the humanitarian parole program. It follows an earlier Trump administration decision to end what it called the \"broad abuse\" of the humanitarian parole, a long-standing legal tool presidents have used to allow people from countries where there is war or political instability to enter and temporarily live in the US.\n\nDuring his campaign, Donald Trump promised to deport millions of people who are in the US illegally, and as president he has also been ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the US and to stay.\n\nUnder the new policy, parolees must depart before their parole termination date if they have no lawful basis to stay in the US.\n\n\"Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status,\" DHS said.\n\nTrump said on 6 March that he would decide \"very soon\" whether to strip the parole status from some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US during the conflict with Russia. Trump's remarks came in response to a Reuters report that said his administration planned to revoke the status for Ukrainians as soon as April.\n\nBiden launched a parole entry program for Venezuelans in 2022 and expanded it to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans in 2023 as his administration grappled with high levels of illegal immigration from those nationalities. Diplomatic and political relations between the four countries and the United States have been strained.\n\nThe new legal pathways came as Biden tried to clamp down on illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border .\n\nThe Trump administration's decision to strip the legal status from half a million immigrants could make many vulnerable to deportation if they choose to remain in the US. It remains unclear how many who entered the US on parole now have another form of protection or legal status.\n\nThe order has already been challenged in federal courts. A group of American citizens and immigrants sued the Trump administration for ending humanitarian parole and are seeking to reinstate the programs for people of the four nationalities.\n\nLawyers and activists raised their voices to denounce the government's decision.\n\nFriday's action is \"going to cause needless chaos and heartbreak for families and communities across the country\", said Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit at the end of February. She called it \"reckless, cruel and counterproductive\"."

After his call with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Trump said that the two men had agreed to a partial ceasefire on \"energy and infrastructure\" targets, indicating that Russia would not target bridges, hospitals, railways or other civilian structures.\n\nHours later, a Russian drone slammed into a Ukrainian hospital. Russia's readout of the call said that it had agreed to a halt on strikes on \"energy infrastructure\", suggesting that everything else was fair game.\n\nBy Wednesday, the White House press secretary was dodging the question of what was discussed, pointing reporters to the administration's readout without clarifying if Trump had misunderstood their discussion.\n\nThat day, Trump surprised the world by announcing that the US was proposing an American-led privatisation of Ukrainian power plants in order to provide a new security guarantee to the Ukrainians. Trump ordered his national security adviser Mike Waltz and secretary of state Marco Rubio to provide an \"accurate\" readout of the call (in itself a curious distinction). In it, they said Trump had told Zelenskyy that \"American ownership of those plants could be the best protection for that infrastructure.\"\n\nNot so fast, said Zelenskyy on Thursday. The power plants are national property and \"belong to all Ukrainians\". A takeover bid had never come up.\n\n\"If the Americans want to take the station from the Russians and they want to invest there and modernise it, that is a completely different issue,\" he said. \"In terms of ownership [of the nuclear power plants], we definitely did not discuss this with President Trump.\"\n\nThe discrepancies are adding up and Ukraine is looking to protect itself from a potentially catastrophic misunderstanding. On Thursday, Zelenskyy also announced that he would send a team of negotiators to Riyadh in order to supply US negotiators with a list of energy infrastructure that it wanted to be included in a partial ceasefire.\n\n\"I don't want there to be a different understanding of what the parties will agree on,\" Zelensky said.\n\nTrump has a habit of describing complex and sometimes compromising conversations in exultant, hyperbolic terms. He famously described one 2019 phone call with Zelenskyy as \"perfect\". During it, he suggested that Ukraine launch an investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter in exchange for future military support.\n\nTrump's recent phone calls, particularly with Putin, have been held in a similar black box. After they spoke this week , the Kremlin said it had demanded a cessation of foreign military aid with Ukraine as part of any long-term peace. That was never discussed, Trump claimed.\n\n\"We didn't talk about aid, actually, we didn't talk about aid at all,\" Trump said. \"We talked about a lot of things, but aid was never discussed.\"\n\nThe US president has sought to control the information that comes out of his private discussions with foreign leaders. And in his recent discussions, particularly with Putin, the White House has not made clear which advisers were present on the calls.\n\nOnly Steve Witkoff, a real-estate mogul and friend of Trump's, has spoken directly about the call, saying it was \"epic, transformational\" and he was \"proud to be an American sitting there listening to it\".\n\nNext week's exercise in shuttle diplomacy in Riyadh may prove a moment when Trump can no longer paper over the cracks. \"There are going to be proximity discussions meaning one group's going to be in this room, one group in this room and they'll sit and talk go back and forth sort of like shuttle diplomacy in a hotel,\" said General Keith Kellogg, the Trump envoy to Ukraine . \"And that's how it's going to work and then we'll find out where everybody stands.\"\n\nThere is a degree of gullibility to the US approach as their business-facing dealmakers begin to encounter veteran Russian diplomats. When Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov met with US negotiators in Riyadh, they brought decades of experience and pointed to draft agreements to help shape the discussions. The US negotiators appeared outflanked.\n\nWitkoff has said he believes that Putin is \"acting in good faith\" and that after the Trump-Putin phone call to prevent attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, the Russian military had shot down seven of their own drones. Some members of Russia's ultrapatriotic right have ridiculed him in subsequent days as gullible.\n\n\"The west believed that nonsense and that's great,\" said Mikhail Zvinchuk, a popular Russian military blogger and propagandist, during an online stream. \"Mr Witkoff said he was impressed by Russia's commitment to peace.\"\n\nPutin's negotiating team in Riyadh is to be led by a former FSB general who headed the department gathering intelligence on Ukraine, and Grigory Karasin, a former diplomat who negotiated the Minsk accords between Russia and Ukraine\n\nThose agreements sought to halt the conflict between Ukraine and Russian-backed proxy forces in the country's south-east. But they were seen as deeply disadvantageous to Ukraine and were plagued by the details of which side had to provide which guarantees and in which order. Ultimately, they collapsed.\n\nOne question as Witkoff, Waltz, and Rubio prepare to travel to Riyadh for the high-stakes meetings on Monday is whether they can summon the expertise to wrangle the details of an 11-year-old conflict with some of Russia's most experienced negotiators sitting across the table."

      "text": "Columbia University capitulates to Trump demands to restore $400m in federal funding - as it happened\n\nChanges include allowing security officers to arrest students and a new official for Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department. This blog is now closed.\n\nDonald Trump is delivering his speech from the Oval Office, seated at his desk next to what appears to be an image of the F-47 fighter jet.\n\nIt's a little hard to make it out, though.\n\nDonald Trump has now shifted to defense, unveiling the F-47 fighter jet program, which he promises will deliver a \"state of the art\" stealth jet.\n\n\"The F-47 will be the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built. An experimental version of the plane has secretly been flying for almost five years, and we're confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other nation,\" Trump said.\n\n\"The F-47 is equipped with state-of-the-art stealth technology. It's virtually unseeable and unprecedented power, the most power of any jet of its kind ever made.\"\n\nIts designation may be an homage to Trump, who is the 47th president.\n\nDonald Trump is speaking now in the Oval Office with defense secretary Pete Hegseth by his side, but began by elaborating on how he will implement his executive order yesterday ordering the dismantling of the Department of Education.\n\n\"I've decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, terrific person, will handle all of the student loan portfolio,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans, tens of thousands of loans, pretty complicated deal, and that's coming out of the Department of Education immediately.\"\n\nHe added that the Department of Health and Human Services \"will be handling special needs and all of the nutrition programs and everything else.\"\n\nDonald Trump spent much of this week touting his efforts to secure a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine. But as the Guardian's Andrew Roth reports, what Trump says and what his negotiating partners understand are often two different things:\n\nDonald Trump's shuttle diplomacy between Russia and Ukraine has at times resembled a game of broken telephone, and the US president's disregard for the details suggests the ceasefire he seeks is further off than his bullish statements may suggest.\n\nConsider the events of just the last week. After his call with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, Trump said that the two men had agreed to a partial ceasefire on \"energy and infrastructure\" targets, indicating that Russia would not target bridges, hospitals, railways or other civilian structures.\n\nHours later, a Russian drone slammed into a Ukrainian hospital.

The power plants are national property and \"belong to all Ukrainians\". A takeover bid had never come up.\n\nReporters at the Pentagon have spotted Elon Musk leaving, after what the New York Times reports was an 80-minute meeting with defense secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nIt is unclear if Musk, who leads Donald Trump 's department of government efficiency initiative and has business interests in China, was briefed on the military's plan for a potential war with Beijing. But the Times reports that Musk's meeting with Hegseth did not take place in a secure Pentagon conference room where it was originally scheduled to take place.\n\nDonald Trump and defense secretary Pete Hegseth are scheduled to at 11am deliver a joint address from the Oval Office, but the White House did not say what it will concern. The Wall Street Journal seems to have uncovered the answer: they will announce a new fighter jet program.\n\nThe new jet will be the most expensive in history, and operate alongside drones, according to the Journal, which adds the plane is geared towards fending off China's air force in the event of a war.\n\nHere's more, from the Journal:\n\nThe piloted planes are to be fielded in the 2030s and would fight alongside semiautonomous drones, as the Pentagon seeks to gain a technological edge over U.S. adversaries.\n\nThe future of the program had been in doubt after the Biden administration opted to leave the final decision on how to proceed to the incoming Trump administration. Elon Musk , the billionaire and Trump ally, has publicly campaigned against manned aircraft, which he said were \"obsolete in the age of drones.\"\n\nMusk arrived at the Pentagon Friday morning for sensitive discussions about China.\n\nAir Force officials have argued that piloted planes are still vital for fighting the wars of the future, especially if they incorporate cutting-edge designs, sophisticated sensors, more powerful engines and control the semiautonomous drones that operate with them.\n\n...\n\nFielding the plane will be expensive, as the new fighters could cost as much as several hundred million dollars each. The Air Force's current Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters cost about $80 million.\n\nThe F-35, which has been a Musk target, is a multi-role plane that is designed mainly for air-to-ground combat. The new fighter has been described as an air-to-air fighter that would replace the F-22 and would be able to fly in heavily defended environments.\n\nDonald Trump is so excited about the reciprocal tariffs he plans to impose on 2 April that he has taken to calling it \"Liberation Day\".\n\nAs he did in a Truth Social post this morning:\n\nApril 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!! For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\n\nBut a recent poll conducted for the Guardian shows that Americans are generally freaked out by the prospect of the United States imposing tariffs on countries worldwide, including a hefty share of Republicans:\n\nDonald Trump is partaking in some royal intrigue with a social media post declaring his love for Britain's King Charles and saying he would welcome a reported \"secret offer\" billed as easing tensions with Canada.\n\nOn Truth Social , the president linked to a story in UK tabloid the Sun, which says:\n\nKING Charles will reportedly make a \"secret offer\" to Donald Trump during his State visit.\n\nThe Royal proposal is said to potentially reduce tensions between the White House and Canada.\n\nPlans are allegedly in the works to make the USA the next \"associate member\" of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe international association, which currently boasts 56 states, could welcome the US as a new member.\n\nIn February, a Tariff war began between the two countries with Trump signing orders to impose near-universal tariffs on goods from Canada entering the United States.\n\nThe US President revealed Canada could avoid higher taxes if it joined the United States of America as its 51 state.\n\nCanada, of which the King is head of state, is part of the Commonwealth of Nations and including America may dampen the current conflict.\n\nTo which Trump responded:\n\nI Love King Charles. Sounds good to me!\n\nBut trade tensions with Canada are likely to grow worse on 2 April, when an exemption from 25% tariffs he imposed on the country expires.\n\nJournalists at the Pentagon have spotted Elon Musk arriving for a visit where he will reportedly be briefed on the military's plan for a potential war with China.\n\nDonald Trump and defense secretary Pete Hegseth have both denied the reports that details of the military's strategy against China will be shared with Musk.\n\nThe US government appears to have complied with a federal judge's request for a high-level official to confirm that it is considering invoking a nation security exemption to avoid sharing details of migrant deportation flights that may have violated a court order.\n\nJustice department attorneys have been in a legal standoff with James Boasberg , a federal judge who over the weekend told the Trump administration not to allow three planes carrying suspected Venezuelan gang members to fly to El Salvador. The planes arrived anyway, and Boasberg has since been demanding details of the aircrafts' itineraries to determine if his order was violated.\n\nThe justice department has said the Trump administration may determine the information is a \"state secret\" that it cannot reveal to the judge. Yesterday, Boasberg demanded that the administration have \"a person with direct involvement in the Cabinet-level discussions\" submit a declaration. That declaration has now arrived, from Todd Blanche , a deputy attorney general, who confirmed his \"direct involvement in ongoing Cabinet-level discussions regarding invocation of the state-secrets privilege.\"\n\nThe government now has until next Tuesday to decide whether to invoke the privilege. Here's more on the back-and-forth between the judge and the Trump administration:"

      "text": "Trump makes rare admission of Musk's conflicts of interest after Pentagon visit\n\nPresident says plans for potential war with China would not be shared with billionaire due to his business interests\n\nDonald Trump said on Friday that plans for possible war with China should not be shared with Elon Musk because of his business interests, a rare admission that the billionaire faces conflicts of interests in his role as a senior adviser to the US president.\n\nTrump rejected reports that Musk would be briefed on how the United States would fight a hypothetical war with China , saying: \"Elon has businesses in China. And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that.\"\n\nThe reference to Musk's businesses - which include Tesla , an electric vehicle manufacturer trying to expand sales and production in China - is an unusual acknowledgment of concerns about Musk balancing his corporate and government responsibilities.\n\nTrump had previously brushed off questions about Musk's potential conflicts of interest, simply saying that he would steer clear when necessary.\n\nThe president said that Musk visited the Pentagon on Friday morning to discuss reducing costs, which he has been working on through the so-called \"department of government efficiency\" (Doge).\n\nThe defense secretary, Pete Hegseth , said Musk was there \"to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations\".\n\nMusk said while leaving the Pentagon that he was ready to do \"anything that could be helpful\". He also refused to answer questions as to whether he received a classified briefing on China as part of the visit.\n\nAs a key adviser to Trump and the head of Doge, Musk has exercised broad powers in the two months since Trump returned to the White House, conducting mass layoffs and slashing budgets across the federal government. But while the Pentagon was also in line to be a target for job cuts, Musk has yet to play any role there, including in defense intelligence and military operations.\n\nA senior defense official told reporters on Tuesday that roughly 50,000 to 60,000 civilian jobs would be cut in the defense department.\n\nMusk's involvement in any US plans or dealings with China would raise not only security concerns but questions over a significant conflict of interest, as he has considerable economic interests in China as the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, which also has contracts with the US air force.\n\nIn the early hours of Friday morning, Musk denied the reports that he would be briefed on war with China, calling it \"pure propaganda\" and threatening to find those who leaked the information.\n\n\"I look forward to the prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information,\" he wrote. \"They will be found.\"\n\nMusk repeated his demand for such prosecutions upon arrival at the Department of Defense on the outskirts of Washington DC on Friday morning. He left the Pentagon about 90 minutes after arriving.\n\nA Pentagon spokesperson, asked by email to explain the true purpose of Musk's briefing given administration denials that it would involve putative war plans with China, referred the Guardian to a statement posted on social media by Hegseth.\n\nIn a Friday meeting at the White House to announce new air force fighter planes, Trump and Hegseth both firmly rejected reports that Musk was shown any Pentagon plans regarding a potential conflict with China during his visit earlier that day.\n\n\"They made that up because it's a good story to make up. They're very dishonest people,\" Trump said about the New York Times reporting. \"I called up Pete [Hegseth] and I said: 'Is there any truth to that?' Absolutely not, he's there for Doge, not there for China. And if you ever mentioned China, I think he'd walk out of the room.\"\n\nHegseth echoed Trump's notion that the visit was focused on discussing government efficiency initiatives and innovation opportunities, adding that there were \"no Chinese war plans\".\n\n\"We welcomed him today to the Pentagon to talk about [the 'department of government efficiency'], to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations. It was a great informal conversation,\" he said.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nHegseth suggested the reporting was deliberately intended to \"undermine whatever relationship the Pentagon has with\" the Tesla CEO.\n\nHowever, some military experts have still expressed concern about Musk's level of access to sensitive information.\n\nWesley Clark, retired general and former Nato supreme commander, told CNN in an interview on Friday afternoon that the administration has been \"cutting a lot of corners in a lot of areas\".\n\n\"It's no problem giving him a general impression, we do this for contractors, but the conflict of interest - I'm more interested in his interests abroad, he talks to Putin, he has business in China, he has other considerations and those can impact things,\" Clark said.\n\n\"I'm more worried about Elon Musk coming into the Pentagon and saying 'I'm high tech and I have smart people in Silicon Valley and these generals do not know anything'. You have got to be really careful about jumping on the next shiny object.\"\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, the meeting was set to take place not in Hegseth's office, where informal meetings about innovation would normally take place, but in a secure conference room known as \"the Tank\", which is typically used for higher-level meetings. Musk was to be briefed on a plan that contains 20 to 30 slides and details how the US military would fight a conflict with China.\n\nOfficials who spoke anonymously with the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal offered up potential reasons why Musk was receiving the briefing. The Times suggested that Musk, in his Doge capacity, might be looking into trimming the Pentagon's budget and would need to know what military assets the US would use in a potential conflict with China.\n\nOne source told the Journal that Musk was receiving the briefing because he asked for one.\n\nThough Musk has a \"top-secret\" clearance within the federal government, lawyers at SpaceX advised him in December not to seek higher levels of security clearances, which would probably be denied due to his foreign ties and personal drug use.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed reporting"

      "text": "Trump's order to dismantle education department sparks outrage: 'See you in court'\n\nPoliticians and teachers unions condemn president's effort to axe department, which can only be done by Congress\n\nTeachers unions and Democratic politicians joined in denouncing Donald Trump 's executive order aimed at eliminating the US Department of Education, with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) saying simply: \" See you in court .\"\n\nTrump's move was long trailed, so much so that Randi Weingarten, the head of the AFT - which represents 1.8 million teachers - put out her statement the day before the order was signed. Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents 200,000 members, teachers and other education workers mostly in New York City, said : \"We will join our national union and public education allies to protect students and educators. We are working with our partners to file lawsuits to stop this executive overreach.\n\n\"In the meantime, we will hold the federal government accountable for providing the resources our school communities have been promised under the laws of our country.\"\n\nElizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said : \"Trump is telling America's public school kids that their futures don't matter.\"\n\nReferencing Elon Musk , the world's richest man, whose drastic cuts to federal budgets and staffing are prompting outrage , Warren said: \"Billionaires like Trump and Musk won't feel it when afterschool programs are slashed, class sizes go up, and student aid gets cut. It'll be working parents, students and teachers who pay the price.\"\n\nRashida Tlaib, a congresswoman from Michigan, said Trump's order was \"really alarming to me because the majority of Americans will tell you they don't want to give up on the Department of Education, they don't want to give up on our education system\".\n\nPolling shows the majority of people in the US oppose dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nThis week, a survey from the advocacy group New America found 55% of respondents against eliminating the department. Another group, Third Way released a poll showing majority support among Republicans for issues including improved accountability for federal funding in higher education - a core responsibility of the education department.\n\nEliminating the department has long been a goal of some parts of the Republican right. On Friday, Margaret Spellings, education secretary under George W Bush, who expanded the department's role, told the Associated Press that Republicans in Congress traditionally voiced support for elimination while voting against it, mindful of how federal funds reach schools in their districts.\n\n\"It was always a little bit of a wink and a nod deal,\" Spellings said . \"Donald Trump has called the bluff.\"\n\nThe Department of Education's role is primarily financial, dispensing federal funds nationwide. It also upholds civil rights protections such as Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nTrump's order will not eliminate the department entirely. Created by Congress in 1972, it can only be eliminated by the same body.\n\nJohn King Jr, who was education secretary under Barack Obama, told NBC : \"I think what you're going to see is bipartisan support in Congress for maintaining the vital functions of the department\" - including, he said, \"directing resources to vulnerable students, low-income students and students with disabilities, funding the Pell grant program and the student loan program that makes it possible for Americans to access higher education, and civil rights enforcement, which has been the historical role of the department\".\n\nAfter Trump signed his order, Linda McMahon, the wrestling impresario turned education secretary charged with wrecking her own department, hailed what she called a \"history-making action\" and said: \"We are sending education back to the states where it so rightly belongs.\"\n\nKing called that \"a rhetorical move\". He continued: \"The reality is that most decision making about education happens at the state and local level, but there is a crucial federal role that goes back to the civil rights movement ... Laws were put in place because we needed the federal government to step in to make sure that students weren't discriminated against, and that role continues.\n\n\"We need the federal government to say to a state: 'You can't ignore the needs of your English learners.' To say to a district: 'You can't leave Black students or Latino students out of access to advanced placement classes or extracurricular activities at your school. That civil rights role has to be protected.\""

      "text": "Trump is abandoning democracy and freedom. That creates an opening for Europe  - and Britain\n\nWhether it's sweeping up disgruntled US scientists or rejoining the EU, a bold Starmer must capitalise on Trump's extremism\n\nT hanks to Donald Trump , a vacancy is opening up in the international jobs market. For decades, if not centuries, and always imperfectly, the US offered itself to the world as the guarantor of democracy and the land of the free. Now that it's pivoting away from that job description, there's an opportunity for someone else to step in.\n\nThe evidence that the US is moving, even galloping, away from basic notions of democracy and freedom is piling up. Just because the changes have happened so fast doesn't make them any less fundamental. We now have a US administration that blithely ignores court rulings , whose officials say out loud \"I don't care what the judges think\" . In a matter of weeks, it has become an open question whether the US remains a society governed by the rule of law.\n\nIn the name of defeating \"woke\" and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, even historic efforts to advance civil rights are disdained or banished into the memory hole: this week it emerged that an army webpage celebrating Harry Truman's 1948 order to integrate the military had disappeared, along with several others honouring distinguished Black soldiers. When asked about it, the press secretary at the Pentagon said: \"DEI is dead at the defense department.\" As for the Department of Education, this week Trump moved to abolish it altogether .\n\nBut if the US is being upended by the Trump hurricane, so is everywhere else in its path, including those places that once looked to the US with admiration. We can all see the coercion of Ukraine into accepting a supposed peace that will require it to surrender its territory to Vladimir Putin and its minerals to Trump . Less visible is the way in which the scything of the US federal government by Trump and Elon Musk is aiding Putin's assault on Ukraine's most vulnerable people - its children.\n\nAmong the US projects cut is a state department initiative to collect evidence of Russian war crimes, including the abduction of more than 20,000 Ukrainian children , many of them sent to Russia for forced adoption. Now there are fears that that information, which might have helped find the children and eventually reunite them with their parents, has been lost, destroyed by the Musk chainsaw. Captain America thought he was a superhero; turns out he's the villain's accomplice.\n\nNow it is those contemptuous of democracy who look to the US for inspiration. This week, Benjamin Netanyahu broke a ceasefire he had agreed with Hamas, resuming devastating airstrikes on Gaza, killing hundreds of Palestinians, in part because he doubtless presumed Trump would give him no grief. But he also sacked the independent-minded head of Israel's domestic intelligence agency , the Shin Bet, the latest move in his ongoing attempt to remove every legal or constitutional constraint on his power. If that reminds you of someone, there's good reason. \"In America and in Israel, when a strong rightwing leader wins an election, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people's will,\" Netanyahu tweeted on Wednesday. \"They won't win in either place! We stand strong together.\" Trump's authoritarian power grab is providing cover for others to do the same.\n\nThis new role for the US, as a beacon of anti-democracy, is having some unintended consequences. Canada was on course to elect a Conservative government; now, by way of a backlash, the Liberals under Mark Carney look set to ride an anti-Trump wave to victory . However it operates, Trumpism is becoming a key determinant of politics the world over.\n\nPerhaps especially in Britain. For most of the last century, the US has been Britain's foremost ally. Put more baldly, London has all but relied on Washington for its own defence. Britain's military and intelligence systems are intricately integrated with those of the US; its nuclear capability is not operationally independent. These last two months, it has become obvious that that is no longer sustainable: Britain cannot rely on a US that behaves more like an enemy than a friend.\n\nThat, in turn, creates a new political fact - we are in an age of rearmament - that will be the organising principle of Rachel Reeves's spring statement next week. It will require either deep cuts or new taxes. Trump has scrambled Britain's finances.\n\nBy itself, that represents a monumental change. But it won't end there. Almost everything we do will need to be rethought. Much of that is cause for alarm - how can Nato function when its mightiest member has become an adversary? - but it also creates opportunities for Britain, if we are only willing to seize them.\n\nTake, as just one example, Trump's war on science. The US has long been the world leader in almost every field of research. But Trump and Musk are slashing or closing one research hub after another, whether at the National Institutes of Health or the Environmental Protection Agency , which could lay off thousands of talented scientists. The administration is threatening academic freedom, forcing US universities to bend to Trumpism or lose funding . This week, a French scientist travelling to the US for a conference was denied entry because, according to the French government, his \"phone contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration's research policy\". You read that right: the man was subjected to a random check at the airport, US officials went through his laptop and phone, found private messages speaking ill of the president and sent him back home.\n\nThis is an opening for Britain, which should be promoting itself as a haven for free, unhindered scientific inquiry. The EU has already spotted the chance, and is devising a plan to lure US scholars . But the UK has the advantage of the English language; it should be first in line. Some see the opportunity, but sadly the UK government is not among them: petitioned to reduce upfront visa costs for overseas scientists, which is an average of 17 times higher than for comparable countries, ministers this week said no .\n\nBut science is only one area where Britain could be taking up the slack. Trump is silencing the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe: the BBC should be given the relatively modest funds required to step in and do the job instead, thereby boosting British soft power at a stroke.\n\nThe first step is understanding that the world has changed and that the old shibboleths no longer apply. It's absurd that Britain, home to Europe's biggest arms industry , is, thanks to Brexit, shut out of the new €150bn (£125bn) EU defence procurement fund , the latest example of how standing apart from its neighbours amounts to reckless folly in the Trump era.\n\nWhat the moment calls for is great boldness. It means Keir Starmer having the courage to tell the country that everything has changed and that we will have to change, too. Yes, that will involve painful sacrifices to pay for rearmament, and the breaking of political taboos, including listening to the majority of Britons who tell pollsters it's time we rejoined the EU.\n\nIt adds up to a vision of a Europe that includes Britain, stepping into the space the US is vacating, guaranteeing and promoting free speech and democratic accountability at the very moment the US is abandoning those ideals. Trump has blasted the door open. All we have to do is walk through it.\n\nOn 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as they discuss Trump's presidency on his 100th day in office , live at Conway Hall London, and live streamed globally.

Nevertheless, at the White House, Trump repeated his campaign promise to \"send education back to the states\".\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill denounced the executive order and warned it could leave in jeopardy millions of low-income families, who rely on federal funding in schools.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the US House minority leader, said in a statement: \"Shutting down the Department of Education will harm millions of children in our nation's public schools, their families and hardworking teachers. Class sizes will soar, educators will be fired, special education programs will be cut and college will get even more expensive.\"\n\nHere are the key US politics story from Thursday:\n\nThe executive order targeting the education department, which has been expected for weeks, directed McMahon to take all necessary steps to shut down key functionalities.\n\nTrump added at the signing ceremony that he hoped McMahon would be the last education secretary.\n\nRead the full story\n\nThe United States has for the first time refused a request by Mexico for water, alleging shortfalls in sharing by its southern neighbor.\n\n\"Mexico's continued shortfalls in its water deliveries under the 1944 water-sharing treaty are decimating American agriculture - particularly farmers in the Rio Grande valley,\" the state department said. The 1944 treaty has come under growing strain in recent years due to the pressures of the climate crisis and burgeoning populations in parched areas.\n\nRead the full story\n\nThe US attorney general announced charges against three people she accused of \"violent destruction of Tesla properties\", amid protests and controversy over Tesla owner Elon Musk 's role in slashing US government staffing and budgets under Donald Trump .\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Pam Bondi said : \"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended.

      "text": "Columbia University caves to demands to restore $400m from Trump administration\n\nMeasures include empowering security officers to arrest people, and reassigning control of Middle East department\n\nColumbia University has yielded to a series of changes demanded by the Trump administration as a pre-condition for restoring $400m in federal funding the government pulled this month amid allegations that the school tolerated antisemitism on campus.\n\nThe university released a memo outlining its agreement with Donald Trump 's administration hours before an extended deadline set by the government was to expire.\n\nColumbia acquiesced to most of the administration's demands in a memo that laid out measures including banning face masks on campus, empowering security officers to remove or arrest individuals, and taking control of the department that offers courses on the Middle East from its faculty.\n\nThe Ivy League university's response is being watched by other universities that the Trump administration has sanctioned as it advances its policy objectives in areas ranging from campus protests to transgender sports and diversity initiatives.\n\nThe Trump administration has warned at least 60 other universities of possible action over alleged failure to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism. It has also targeted at least three law firms that the president says helped his political opponents or helped prosecute him unfairly.\n\nAmong the most contentious of the nine demands, Columbia agreed to place its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department under a new official, the memo said, taking control away from its faculty.\n\n\"In this role, the Senior Vice Provost will review the educational programs to ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced,\" the memo read, explaining that the review would start with the Center for Palestine Studies; the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies; the Middle East Institute; and other university programs focused on the Middle East.\n\nThe new official would also be in control of the review process for hiring the university's non-tenured staff and for approving curricular changes.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania and a \"proud\" graduate of Columbia, called it a sad day for the university.\n\n\"Historically, there is no precedent for this,\" Zimmerman said. \"The government is using the money as a cudgel to micromanage a university.\"\n\nZimmerman said the White House actions had apparently already had a chilling effect on higher education because officials at other universities failed to band together and speak out.\n\nThe White House had yet to respond to Columbia's memo as of Friday evening, and the status of the funding remained unclear.\n\nThe sudden shutdown of millions of dollars in federal funding to Columbia University this month had already been disrupting medical and scientific research at the school, researchers said.\n\nScientists and doctors who had been awarded grants by the National Institutes of Health after months or years of work described receiving unusual notices by email last week saying their projects had been terminated because of \"unsafe antisemitic actions\".\n\nCanceled projects included the development of an AI-based tool to help nurses detect the deterioration of a patient's health in hospital two days earlier than other early warning systems.\n\nThe administration also canceled funding for a study designed to improve the safety of blood-transfusion therapies for adults, children and newborns, and research on uterine fibroids, which are non-cancerous tumors that can cause pain and affect women's fertility.\n\nThe demand had raised alarm among professors at Columbia and elsewhere, who worried that permitting the federal government to dictate how a department is run would set a dangerous precedent.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives last year criticized at least two professors of Palestinian descent working in the department for their comments about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe school has also hired three dozen special officers who have the power to arrest people on campus and has revised its anti-discrimination policies, including its authority to sanction campus organizations, the memo said.\n\nFace masks to conceal identities are no longer allowed, and any protesters must now identify themselves when asked, the memo said.\n\nThe school also said it is searching for new faculty members to \"ensure intellectual diversity\". Columbia plans to fill joint positions in the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and the international affairs school in an effort to ensure \"excellence and fairness in Middle East studies\", the memo said. The sudden shutdown of millions of dollars in federal funding to Columbia University this month was already disrupting medical and scientific research at the school, researchers said.\n\nColumbia has come under particular scrutiny, following the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled its campus last year, when its lawns filled with tent encampments and noisy rallies against the US government's support of Israel.\n\nRepublican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives last year criticized at least two professors of Palestinian descent working in Columbia's Middle Eastern studies department for their comments about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza."

One such filing accused the judge of \"continuing to beat a dead horse\" with his requests for more information from the Justice Department, which only responded in part, alleging that the judge's orders were \"immaterial.\"\n\n\"I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my order, who ordered this and what the consequences will be,\" Boasberg said during an approximately 90-minute hearing.\n\nThe judge acknowledged that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was \"incredibly troublesome\" and \"unprecedented.\"\n\nIt was \"awfully frightening\" to think of the broader consequences of Trump's actions, Boasberg said.\n\nThe judge's comments come as the Trump administration mulls whether to invoke the state secrets privilege in order to thwart the judge's demands for more information on the migrant flights.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a former personal attorney for Trump, said in a sworn statement Friday that Cabinet-level officials were discussing the possibility of doing so.\n\nOn Thursday, Boasberg ordered the Justice Department to confirm that such discussions were taking place and to make a final decision by March 25. In the same order, Boasberg told the Trump administration its responses to his orders thus far had been \"woefully insufficient.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The Law Firm Paul Weiss Chooses Cowardice In Confrontation With Trump\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, a nearly 150-year-old law firm, bent the knee to President Donald Trump Thursday evening when it struck a deal to get rid of the president's executive order apparently punishing the firm for once employing a lawyer who worked on a case targeting the president.\n\nTrump's executive order purported to ban the law firm from government contracts, restrict its lawyers from federal buildings and require clients to disclose their employment of the firm when seeking government contracts. It would have been an existential blow to the firm, which operates a broad multinational practice that encompasses everything from mergers and acquisitions to white-collar defense to civil rights and free speech litigation. The deal to make the order go away, as described in a statement posted by Trump on Thursday, requires the firm to restrict its diversity, equity and inclusion practices and provide $40 million in pro bono services to the administration. In effect, the firm has not simply paid off, but joined the administration.\n\nPaul Weiss' acquiescence is the latest example of a great menace stalking the country in the early days of Trump's second term: cowardice.\n\nLet's be clear about what happened here, Trump's mafioso government extorted the firm to give up its historic support for civil rights and join itself to enacting his autocratic agenda. The firm could have challenged this illegal extortion, as the firm Perkins Coie, also targeted by the administration , has done with success so far , but instead it chose Vichy-style collaboration.\n\n\"We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss,\" Brad Karp, Paul Weiss chairman, said in a statement included in Trump's post. \"We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.\"\n\nThis is particularly galling from a firm with a laudable history of standing up for civil rights and the advancement of minority groups. Paul Weiss was the first mixed Jewish and WASP law firm in New York City. It was the first American law firm to employ a Black associate, a Black woman associate and first to make a woman a partner. The firm also worked alongside former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Brown v. Board of Education case that ended formal segregation in schools, fought for more inclusive immigration laws during and after the Holocaust and defended free speech rights in a landmark case involving D.H. Lawrence's novel \"Lady Chatterley's Lover.\"\n\nTo protect its present pecuniary interests, the firm has now decided to throw that history in the gutter by accepting surrender to Trump's anti-DEI initiatives.\n\nAcquiescing to the Trump administration's anti-DEI pressure campaign should not be seen in the light of the debate over the merits or demerits of DEI that preceded this administration. Instead, it should be understood as the Trump administration understands it: a frontal assault on civil rights law and desegregation.\n\nAdministration allies have all but admitted as much, as conservative activist Chris Rufo did in an interview with The New York Times' Ross Douthat .\n\nThe administration's actions are also very clear on this. Just look at what the Department of Defense is doing.\n\nLinks to web pages about Black, Latino and female military servicemembers buried at Arlington Cemetery have been deleted from parts of the cemetery's web site. Web pages touting the accomplishments of Black servicemembers, including baseball great Jackie Robinson, were taken down and affixed with the label \"DEI\" in the page's URL. (The administration reversed course and restored some pages, including Robinson's, following outrage from sports media on Thursday.)\n\nThe General Services Administration also removed a requirement for contractors to not operate segregated facilities if they wanted to obtain contracts.\n\nThis is what eliminating DEI means to the Trump administration. And now, that's what it means for Paul Weiss.\n\nThe firm has already begun to accept the Trump administration's principles. Some time after the executive order came down, but before the firm allowed itself to be extorted, the firm took down a web page and links to its Center to Combat Hate. The firm launched the center in May 2024 to perform litigation alongside civil rights groups \"to confront and redress hate-driven violence and intimidation\" in order to \"foster a more just and equitable society.\" All links to it, including on the social media web site LinkedIn, are now dead.\n\nPaul Weiss is not alone among elite institutions in choosing a whimper, not a bang when threatened by the Trump autocracy. Universities are largely bending over backwards to protect their own financial interests. Administrators at Columbia University are considering allowing itself to be extorted into giving up the university's autonomy in order to keep $400 million in grants that the administration is using as leverage. The administration is also targeting the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University with similar extortion efforts to seize control of their operations, with dozens of others likely to follow suit.\n\nNonprofits are being cowed into deleting references to diversity and inclusion, transgender people and changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico, sometimes after facing direct threats from the administration.\n\nCorporations are sucking up and paying up to the administration in pursuit of government contracts, protection from investigation or prosecution and any number of corrupt acts they can extract from the nation's mob boss. In some cases, corporate leaders, particularly in Silicon Valley, have fully embraced autocratic theories of government as a way to further enrich and empower themselves.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

They have forgotten that liberalism and democracy do not just provide rights that protect their private interests, but demand public duties of citizens to uphold them. Those who choose otherwise accept their own corruption.\n\nThese elite institutions cannot, and will not save liberalism. Nor will they save democracy.

It singled out the work of Mark Pomerantz, who previously worked at the firm and who oversaw an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office into Trump's finances before Trump became president.\n\nTo avoid those consequences, the White House said Paul, Weiss had agreed to \"take on a wide range of pro bono matters that represent the full spectrum of political viewpoints of our society,\" to disavow the use of diversity, equity and inclusion considerations in its hiring and promotion decisions and to dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in free legal services to support Trump administration policies on issues including assistance for veterans and countering anti-Semitism.\n\nIn a statement issued by the White House, Karp said: \"We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss.

      "text": "There's A Reason Trump Is Always Pointing His Finger At People - And It's Surprisingly Powerful\n\nSenior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost\n\nChristopher Hart , a professor of linguistics at Lancaster University in the U.K., noticed something early on about how U.S. President Donald Trump communicates: The man loves to point, and it has a surprisingly powerful effect on his followers. (More on that later.)\n\nUnlike a lot of politicians, Trump ― always a bit of a showman, given his reality TV background ― connects with his supporters at political rallies with a combination of rhetoric and gestures. It's not just during speeches that he'll strategically point his fingers; he'll point to a political ally after they introduce him on the campaign trail, or to a member of the administration he wants to boost, like he did here at the White House in 2018 with outgoing spokesperson Hope Hicks .\n\nHe homes in on his enemies by pointing, too, like he did in the final presidential debate against Hillary Clinton in 2016, pictured below. It's a kind of \"can you believe this person?\" index-finger indictment.\n\nHe's given to pointing to himself, too ― or to the branding on a Trump hat.\n\nAnd if there's a solar eclipse, he'll definitely point and stare at that bad boy , even if scientists warn against doing so without protective eyewear.\n\nHart, the aforementioned researcher, is intrigued by Trump's penchant for pointing because, while a decent amount of research has been devoted to how politicians use their words to influence followers, few have studied the ways nonverbal cues can cultivate a following.\n\n\"I am interested in the gestural performances of right-wing populists specifically, so Trump was an obvious place to start,\" Hart told HuffPost.\n\nIn a recent study published in the journal Social Semiotics , Hart analyzed a campaign rally and found that Trump defaults to a pointing gesture more than once per minute, which is a lot.\n\n\"Trump is not the only politician to make use of pointing gestures, but I was surprised at just how frequently he points,\" he said. \"There is something about the live setting of the campaign rally that seems to invite a density of pointing gestures for him.\"\n\nTo carry out his study, Hart looked at a 60-minute video recording of a presidential campaign rally held in Buffalo, New York, on April 18, 2016. The high-energy rally ― viewable on YouTube ― was attended by more than 11,000 people in Trump's home state.\n\nWhen Trump points outward, away from his body, he's either referring to the audience directly (\"you\") or to enemy third parties (\"they,\" \"them,\" or specific individuals or groups like the media or protesters).\n\nWhen the president points at his followers, he's engaging with them, drawing them further into the fold. When he points to his critics ― media in the stands or protesters who've gotten into the event ― he's \"othering\" them, singling them out as an object of scorn.\n\nTrump's always pointing, Hart found, even absent of speech: \"He does it to great effect, either as a show of appreciation toward individual audience members or as part of theatrical routines, like pointing to the top of an imagined border wall.\"\n\nAnd when he points, his crowds of supporters eat it up, Hart said.\n\nOf course, Trump's pointing reflects his experience in the entertainment world: Before \"The Apprentice\" made him a reality TV star, he was a frequent guest on WWE , where wild gesticulating and other theatrics ― head-licking , head-shaving ― are commonplace.\n\n\"The way he points and singles out audience members is definitely characteristic of live entertainment,\" Hart said. \"He's including himself with the audience, as a man of the people.\"\n\nAs for Trump's habit of pointing to himself, Hart figures that's done to demonstrate sincerity or build a quick emotional rapport with his audience. He similarly points downward when speaking about a location ― \"this country\" or \"Buffalo\" ― to connect a broader political message to the specific location of the rally: Don't worry, you ― or your city ― will directly benefit from this political agenda.\n\nWhy does any of this matter? Because something as simple as finger-pointing speaks to how Trump gained his unprecedented populist following.\n\n\"The way Trump uses pointing gestures breaks with the ways politicians normally communicate, making for an energized and entertaining performance,\" Hart said. \"That's a large part of his appeal.\"\n\nPrevious studies have shown that politicians traditionally rely on a \"restricted gestural code\" ― a small, stable set of gestures ― presumably having been told that minimal movement conveys confidence, assertiveness or intellectual precision, Hart said.\n\n\"An example of this is the ' thist ,' in which the thumb is placed horizontally over a clenched fist,\" Hart said. \"Other gestures are avoided perhaps for fears that they will distract audiences from the main message.\"\n\nIn the wrong hands, though, that can all feel stiff and overly rehearsed. At worst, it distances the politician from the way the rest of us communicate, Hart said. Think of how stilted Richard Nixon came across when juxtaposed with the cool, calm, collected body language of John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential debate. (Kennedy would of course go on to win.)\n\nStiff body language \"is not the case for populist politicians whose gestures seem to be more spontaneous, conversational in style and genuinely charismatic,\" Hart said. \"They often reflect, albeit in an exaggerated form, the way ordinary people interact. It's part of the populist playbook.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Trump Ramps Up Attacks On Judges, Calls Out Justice John Roberts\n\nReporter\n\nPresident Donald Trump took to social media on Thursday to further air his grievances about \"radical left judges, \" aka anyone who imposes barriers to his mass deportation plans.\n\nTrump, who has been widely accused of violating the U.S. Constitution on numerous occasions , baselessly argued that rulings and decisions from judges who he disagrees with could \"very well lead to the destruction of our Country!\"\n\n\"These Judges want to assume the Powers of the Presidency, without having to attain 80 Million Votes. They want all of the advantages with none of the risks. Again, a President has to be allowed to act quickly and decisively about such matters as returning murderers, drug lords, rapists, and other such type criminals back to their Homeland, or to other locations that will allow our Country to be SAFE,\" Trump said on Truth Social .\n\n\"It is our goal to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and such a high aspiration can never be done if Radical and Highly Partisan Judges are allowed to stand in the way of JUSTICE,\" Trump continued. \"If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!\"\n\nTrump has often been critical of judges , or anyone who disagrees with him really. His latest post comes after he used the 1798 Enemy Aliens Act , which has not been used since World War II, on Saturday to expedite his mass deportation plans.\n\nThe Trump administration flew hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants, arguing they were dangerous gang members without providing evidence, to a prison in El Salvador against the orders of Judge James Boasberg, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C.\n\nBoasberg requested specific information about the migrant flights, but what Justice Department officials provided was late and \"woefully insufficient,\" according to Boasberg. Boasberg has doubled down on the demand for more information.\n\nIn another Truth Social post on Thursday, Trump accused Boasberg, who has ruled in favor of Trump on multiple occasions , of \"doing everything in his power to usurp the Power of the Presidency.\"\n\n\"He is a local, unknown Judge, a Grandstander, looking for publicity, and it cannot be for any other reason, because his 'Rulings' are so ridiculous, and inept. SAVE AMERICA!\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump had called for Boasberg to be impeached and referred to him as a \"Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Trump Says Jan. 6 Rioters Were Nothing Like Those 'Terrorist' Tesla Vandals\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nSpeaking Friday from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump suggested the Capitol rioters were tame compared with the people responsible for setting Tesla vehicles ablaze in protest of billionaire Elon Musk's meddling in the federal government.\n\n\"I view these people as terrorists just like others,\" Trump said of the Tesla vandals.\n\n\"When I looked at those showrooms burning, and those cars - not one or two, like seven, eight, 10 burning, exploding all over the place - these are terrorists,\" he said.\n\n\"You didn't have that on Jan. 6, I can tell you. You didn't have anything like that Jan. 6,\" Trump went on, referring to the 2021 riot that left several people dead.\n\nA police officer was among those who died either during the riot or directly afterward. Trump notably issued a mass pardon for hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters in the first days of his new term, regardless of whether their crimes involved physical violence.\n\nThe president suggested earlier on Friday that people who attack Teslas should be sent to prison in El Salvador , where his administration recently transported over 250 migrants.\n\nAttacks on Teslas ramped up across the nation and around the world after Musk made an arm gesture at Trump's inauguration rally that resembled a Nazi-era \"Sieg heil\" salute. (Musk denies the comparison.) The world's richest man has since taken on a prominent White House role guiding the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has pressured agency leads into making sweeping, unpopular cuts to the federal workforce and government services.\n\nDramatic footage of burning Teslas in Las Vegas went viral this week. Similar incidents have been reported at a Tesla dealership in Missouri , a charging station in Canada , a service center in Oregon , a dealership in Colorado and a charging station in South Carolina , among other places.\n\nTrump and his administration officials have been heaping praise on Musk in response to the backlash, with Trump even briefly transforming the driveway of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue into a Tesla showroom last week. In a made-for-TV moment, the president said he was purchasing one of Musk's vehicles.\n\nThis week, Attorney General Pam Bondi promised \"serious charges\" and harsh punishments for the individuals behind a recent high-profile string of arson attacks on Tesla dealerships, calling their actions \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nBondi said Thursday that three individuals had already been charged in connection with various Tesla attacks, although her office did not specify what those charges were.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The Progressive Legal Group That Keeps Taking On Trump In The Courts - And Winning\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― More than 5,000 people got their jobs back at the U.S. Department of Agriculture this month after a government employee oversight board concluded they had been illegally fired by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe decision by that panel, the Merit Systems Protection Board, came after it restored the jobs of six other federal employees who had been similarly fired by DOGE.\n\nMeanwhile, this month, a federal judge blocked DOGE from firing the president of a small federal agency, the U.S. African Development Foundation, in a lawsuit that provides the clearest details yet on how DOGE operates and how it may be routinely breaking the law.\n\nAll of these legal challenges came from the same group, a well-funded progressive legal organization, Democracy Forward.\n\nAt a time when the flood of litigation against President Donald Trump's early actions is nearly impossible to keep up with ― his administration has already been hit with more than 130 legal challenges in the span of two months ― Democracy Forward has emerged as a leading legal organization that's been slowing, if not stopping, some of Trump's recklessness through the courts.\n\nThe group doesn't just stand out for the number of lawsuits it's been filing, which include more than 28 legal actions and 67 investigations since Trump was sworn in. Democracy Forward has shown it can move quickly to step in amid Trump's chaotic, and often illegal, efforts to dismantle entire agencies, freeze federal spending, and fire thousands of federal employees. It has intervened on behalf of individual people, unions, nonprofit groups, health care professionals, educators, veterans groups and religious groups.\n\nAnd importantly, it's been winning.\n\nOn Saturday, Democracy Forward and the American Civil Liberties Union challenged Trump's expansion of war time powers to deport immigrants using the centuries-old Alien Enemies Act. Within hours, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing Trump from removing some people through this act ― and later that day, broadened the scope of his order to cover all immigrants in danger of removal under the act.\n\nIn another case brought by Democracy Forward, a federal judge last week reaffirmed the court's nationwide preliminary injunction (i.e., a temporary court order to preserve the status quo) that halted Trump's efforts to arbitrarily terminate federal grants relating to diversity, equity and inclusion, and accessibility programs. The judge reaffirmed that not only can Trump not do that, but that this temporary halt applies to all agencies in the executive branch.\n\nThe group also secured the first and only nationwide order preventing Trump from imposing a sweeping freeze on trillions of dollars in federal spending, blocked a Trump administration policy enabling immigration enforcement officers to indiscriminately raid houses of worship, and this week prompted a federal judge to slam the Trump administration's defense of DOGE and grant a request by labor and economic organizations to get more details about the Elon Musk-led entity unlawfully accessing sensitive data at federal agencies.\n\nThe evidence the Trump administration put forward to avoid more transparency into DOGE's operations \"is not the panacea they hoped it would be,\" this judge concluded.\n\nA big reason this organization has been so adept at countering Trump in court is because it spent the last 18 months gaming out legal strategies for responding to countless policy plans laid out in Project 2025, the far-right policy blueprint that the Heritage Foundation put together in preparation for a second Trump presidency.\n\nDemocracy Forward staff indexed the entire 900-page policy playbook , broke it down into different categories, put it in a spreadsheet and meticulously laid out what legal actions they should prepare to take based on how the Trump administration was likely to proceed with various policies, whether it be through executive orders, statutes or regulations.\n\nThey also coordinated with more than 450 civil society groups and state attorneys general to prepare for different scenarios where certain groups would be impacted by Project 2025 policies, and figured out when they should team up to defend the rule of law.\n\nTrump tried to distance himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail because lots of its plans are extreme and unpopular. But the policy guidebook was put together by former Trump administration officials and staunch allies, so it's not surprising to see the president now moving aggressively to enact some of its proposals, like purging tens of thousands of federal workers for political reasons or abolishing the Department of Education.\n\nIn fact, late Thursday, Trump signed an executive order to dismantle the education department. Minutes later, Democracy Forward announced it would see him in court .\n\n\"Trump's playbook is a known playbook,\" Skye Perryman, Democracy Forward's president and CEO, told HuffPost in an interview. \"The Heritage Foundation wrote it down: Project 2025. We never believed it was a talking point or hyperbole. It is the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nDemocracy Forward also prepared for a second Trump presidency by gathering materials from his first administration to review what legal actions and litigation he previously pursued, whether they be related to his executive orders, immigration cases, impoundment or challenges to executive orders issued by former President Joe Biden.\n\nThe president has done some unexpected things in his second term, like tapping Musk to oversee DOGE and letting him gain access to millions of Americans' personal data. But Perryman said her organization was primed to respond to something chaotic, and in the case of DOGE, they sued on day one.\n\n\"This is like basic stuff,\" she said.\n\n\"They do not play within the rules. There is opportunity in their lawlessness,\" Perryman said. \"They make a lot of legal foibles.\"\n\nDemocracy Forward currently represents the American Federation of Teachers in two lawsuits, one that aims to halt DOGE's seizure of millions of people's sensitive data from the Social Security Administration, and another challenging a new Department of Education policy threatening to withhold federal money from schools teaching accurate history about slavery and diversity.\n\nAFT, which has more than 1.8 million members, had been preparing to fight Trump's executive order to dissolve the Department of Education when the department unexpectedly announced a new policy of stripping federal funds from schools that support diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, said Daniel McNeil, general counsel at AFT. So the teachers' group asked Democracy Forward if they wanted to team up to fight that, too.\n\n\"They already had something ready to go,\" McNeil said. \"It took working through the entire weekend to get it done, but they weren't fazed at all by the fact that something else happened.\"\n\nAFT is working with other legal groups suing the Trump administration, he said, and they're also doing good work. What's unique about Democracy Forward's model, though, is that they have their own attorneys doing the litigating versus hiring outside firms, and they have experts on staff, like someone who previously worked in the general counsel's office at the Department of Education. They've also just been anticipating specific legal fights, he said.\n\n\"Of all the groups that were warning about Project 2025, they were systematically planning for the legal fight in the event that Trump were elected,\" said McNeil. \"For months in advance, they were thinking in a way that was like, 'How do we challenge an executive order that does X? Who is the right party to challenge if Y happens?' I think that's what makes them different.\"\n\nDemocracy Forward first launched in 2017, in response to what it described as the first Trump administration's \"unprecedented\" threats to democracy and the rule of law. By 2019, it had sued his administration more than 100 times and chalked up several wins, including forcing the administration to collect pay data from employers based on race, gender and ethnicity, and forcing the FDA to regulate e-cigarettes.\n\nBoth Democracy Forward and its nonprofit counterpart, Democracy Forward Foundation, are chaired by Marc Elias, who served as general counsel for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. The nonprofit is funded entirely by individual donors and philanthropic institutions. Its major donors include the Sandler Foundation, which gave $16 million from 2018 to 2023, and the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, which gave $5.6 million from 2021 to 2023.\n\nDemocracy Forward was operating with a budget of about $12.4 million in 2023, the most recent year its tax filings are available.\n\n\"Trump's playbook is a known playbook.\"\n\nThe organization has been hiring up for Trump's second term. Last month, it brought on more litigators, public affairs specialists and operations personnel ― several of whom are seasoned former federal staffers from agencies that Democracy Forward will likely be seeing in court amid its lawsuits against the Trump administration, including the Justice Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Interior Department.\n\nOne of its newest hires, Joel McElvain, was the acting deputy general counsel at HHS, where he was responsible for legal advice on all matters relating to Medicare and Medicaid statutes and the Affordable Care Act. Another recent hire, Michael Waldman, was special counsel at the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he advised the secretary on oversight matters and managed the department's responses to congressional inquiries.\n\nShawn Phetteplace of Main Street Alliance, a network of roughly 30,000 small business owners that support left-of-center policies, has worked with Democracy Forward for years and is currently represented by them in three cases against the Trump administration. One case relates to the Office of Management and Budget's freeze on billions of dollars on Jan. 27 in congressional approved federal grants being disbursed.\n\nThis funding freeze resulted in multiple small business owners having their money cut off, to the point where they weren't sure if they could continue to operate, said Phetteplace. Within hours of OMB announcing its new directive, Democracy Forward requested a temporary restraining order in federal court. A judge granted that order on Feb. 3, and by Feb. 25, the judge granted a preliminary injunction , blocking the nationwide freeze from taking effect, for now.\n\n\"They keep winning,\" Phetteplace said of Democracy Forward. \"For our members, this isn't theoretical. This is whether or not they stay in business.\"\n\nHe chalks up some of the group's success to the public-facing push it makes on the cases it's fighting. He gave the example of Main Street Alliance members reaching out to the group to talk about how their businesses were hurt by Trump's policies, and then how litigation has helped them. Democracy Forward has been incorporating those stories into its public statements as it moves forward with various lawsuits.\n\n\"They understand that it is really important to shape the public narrative around the issue and educate the public about the stakes,\" he said. \"That helps them make a stronger case.\"\n\nTo be sure, Democracy Forward has faced setbacks in stemming Trump's chaos, and that's due to at least some of its victories being temporary. Last month, it filed emergency litigation in response to Trump's plans to unilaterally defund the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a financial watchdog agency. Their quick legal action resulted in the administration backing off its plans , instead agreeing to wait until a related case was heard in court.\n\nA federal judge has since heard that case ― and this week denied the plaintiffs' request to halt the administration's plans for CFPB.\n\nTemporary wins are still wins. When a judge issues a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, it immediately blocks an action and buys time. Preliminary injunctions in particular can drag on for a long time. Democracy Forward and other groups have already demonstrated that collectively taking these legal steps has a real effect on slowing Trump's unlawful, everywhere-all-at-once approach to dismantling the federal government.\n\nDemocracy Forward chalked up another temporary, but significant, victory in one of its cases late on Thursday: A federal judge blocked DOGE workers from accessing Social Security systems, calling the Musk-led efforts at this agency a \"fishing expedition.\"\n\n\"This is a major win for working people and retirees across the country,\" said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, one of the plaintiffs in the case. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"\n\nSome Trump allies are mad at the success that Democracy Forward and other groups have found in the courts, particularly in cases where judges have issued nationwide injunctions halting some of the president's actions. In a nonsensical show of fealty to Trump, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) on Thursday vowed to introduce legislation to prevent U.S. district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions ― something that is, in fact, their jobs.\n\n\"That is not a power that I think district courts have,\" Hawley, a Yale Law School alum who knows better, claimed on The Charlie Kirk Show, a far-right podcast. \"Either the Supreme Court needs to intervene and make clear there's only one court that can issue rules for the whole country ... and/or, if they won't do that, Congress needs to legislate and make clear that district courts do not have the ability to issue these kinds of injunctions.\"\n\nFor her part, Perryman said one reason it's important to slow things down in the courts is because it creates transparency on what Trump is actually doing. Doing so gives Americans a better understanding of the illegality of his actions, she said, and forces his administration to keep answering for what it's doing.\n\n\"Understand that chaos is part of the strategy,\" she said.\n\n\"Every day in litigation, what we see in this administration is they back off,\" Perryman added. \"Because really, the purpose is to see what they can do quickly. They don't hold great conviction. There is opportunity in that.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Trump Announces Boeing Wins Contract For Secretive Future Fighter Jet\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing will build the Air Force's future fighter jet, which the Pentagon says will have stealth and penetration capabilities that far exceed those of its current fleet and is essential in a potential conflict with China.\n\nKnown as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.\n\nTrump announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth . Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"\n\nCritics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon's future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.\n\nMore than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.\n\nA fleet of about 100 future B-21 stealth bombers at an estimated total cost of at least $130 billion is also planned. The first B-21 aircraft are now in test flights.\n\nWith evolving drone and space warfare likely to be the center of any fight with China, Dan Grazier, a military procurement analyst, questions whether \"another exquisite manned fighter jet really is the right platform going forward.\" Grazier, director of the national security reform program at the Stimson Center, said $20 billion is \"just seed money. The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\"\n\nFew details of what the new NGAD fighter would look like have been public, although test versions are said to have been flown already. Renderings by both Lockheed Martin and Boeing have highlighted a flat, tail-less aircraft with a sharp nose.\n\nA separate Navy contract for its version of the NGAD fighter is still under competition between Northrop Grumman and Boeing.\n\nLast year, the Biden administration's Air Force secretary, Frank Kendall, ordered a pause on the NGAD program to review if the aircraft was still needed or if the program, which was first designed in 2018, needed to be modified to reflect the past few years of warfighting advances.\n\nThat review by think tanks and academia examined what conflict with China would look like with NGAD and then without it - and determined that NGAD was still needed. Kendall then left the decision on which firm would build the fighter jet to the incoming Trump administration, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide details on the decision-making.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Trump's Vision for America: I Am God\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTalia Lavin, journalist and author of \"Wild Faith,\" on the right-wing Christian ideology and characters guiding Trump.\n\nIn an address to Congress on Tuesday, President Donald Trump once again cast himself as a divine savior of the American people.\"I was saved by God to make America great again,\" he claimed as he recounted the failed assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nDuring his 100-minute speech, Trump made direct appeals to the Christian right, a major segment of his base: \"This will be our greatest era. With God's help over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher.\"\n\nHe framed a series of policy proposals - many attacking civil rights for minorities and trans people - as part of God's plan for the nation. He called on Congress \"to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children,\" proclaiming \"our message to every child in America is that you are perfect, exactly the way God made you.\"\n\nIn some ways, Trump is the kind of political leader the Christian right has been seeking for decades. He has fully championed the movement's long-held policy priorities: overturning Roe v. Wade , pushing prayer in schools , and curbing LGBTQ+ rights. Now he is taking their movement even further, embedding right-wing Christian ideology into every facet of federal policy.\n\nIt's a \"broad coalition across Christian denominations,\" says journalist Talia Lavin, \"whose goal is an extremely socially restrictive agenda.\" Lavin, author of \"Wild Faith: How the Christian Right Is Taking Over America,\" argues that today's Christian right is more receptive to authoritarianism than previous generations. \"They've reached a kind of acme or apotheosis of their power and influence, where that sort of attitude towards democracy has attained real relevance in the way we're governed.\"\n\nOn this week's episode of The Intercept Briefing, Lavin and Intercept reporter Jessica Washington examine the Christian right's growing influence, its long-term strategy, and what, if anything, can be done to curb their vision for the country.\n\nWashington warns that many liberals dismiss Trump's alliance to the Christian right as fringe, missing its deep political impact. \"While it's this convenient political organizing tool, it is also a deeply held belief,\" she says - one that rejects the idea that Black people and queer people have a rightful place in American leadership. Trump, she adds, validates the belief that only white Christian males are the true inheritors of the nation's legacy. \"Trump is both a product of and an accelerant of this movement.\"\n\nCountering the rapid lurch toward Christian nationalism, Washington argues, requires solidarity. \"We all have to band together and fight this together. And not allowing ourselves to be siloed into different issues. And recognizing that this is an attack on everyone who doesn't fit this very specific mold.\"\n\nLavin calls for active resistance - a \"joyous cacophony\" - to the Christian right's war on diversity, on the poor, and democracy: \"We're gonna be gender rebels. We're not going to accept the gutting of social services.

      "text": "Appeasement Is Failing: Why Fighting Back Against Trump Is the Only Option\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIf there's any lesson so far in Trump's second term, it's that playing nice isn't just bad optics - it's a losing strategy.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y., capitulated to President Donald Trump and the GOP over the budget this week , sacrificing one of Democrats' last pieces of leverage as Trump bulldozes the federal government and jails activists. Schumer defended voting yes on the GOP budget that would neuter the legislative branch, arguing that he had no choice but to give in or face a government shutdown. He's not the first to make that kind of decision.\n\nLeaders of businesses, universities, and nations across the globe face the same question: Should they fight Trump, or hope that by giving him what he wants he'll somehow do less harm?\n\nFar too often, these leaders have chosen appeasement over resistance - and, in return, gotten nothing.\n\nAt Columbia University, leadership has remained largely silent over the Trump administration's arrest of recent graduate Mahmoud Khalil , a Palestinian activist with legal permanent residency in the United States. The Trump administration has not charged Khalil with a crime , arguing instead that his pro-Palestinian campus activism made him a national security threat. Rather than publicly defending its students, Columbia on Thursday expelled, suspended, or revoked degrees of students protesting Israel's war on Gaza, sending a clear signal of where the university stands in regard to academic speech rights. The fact that the university opted to crack down on its students even after the Trump administration cut $400 million of federal funding is a sign the school is still trying to appease Trump rather than resist him. In a letter responding to the cuts , interim university president Katrina Armstrong wrote that Columbia was committed to \"working with the federal government\" and said that combating antisemitism is its \"number one priority.\"\n\nThe university had a similar response to the Department of Homeland Security raiding two students' rooms earlier this week. In a campuswide email , Armstrong refused to condemn the raids, writing that \"Columbia is committed to upholding the law.\" Now it appears that another student has been detained by immigration officials.\n\nYet despite these conciliatory efforts to placate an increasingly powerful president, the Trump administration continues to target Columbia and its students. On Thursday, the Department of Education threatened the school in a letter , demanding further crackdowns on student activism, a mask ban, increased authority for campus police, and that the university place its departments of Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies on receivership, which could cede control of those departments to an external authority.\n\nIf there's any lesson from the early months of the second Trump term, it's that playing nice with Trump isn't just bad optics - it's a losing strategy. Resistance to Trump has netted some early victories, particularly in the courts , where some cuts by Trump and Elon Musk have been put on ice, and in foreign trade, where some countries that responded in kind to the threat of U.S. tariffs have seen those fees delayed.\n\n\"Conceding to the authoritarian agenda won't save us. The more we willingly give bullies, the more they forcibly take,\" said Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., in a statement to The Intercept.\n\nRamirez argued that these capitulations go far deeper than giving into Trump on the budget; it's about Democrats ceding ideological ground on a range of issues without so much as a fight.\n\n\"Some of my colleagues have willingly conceded ground on immigration, cancer research, the rights to due process and free speech, Social Security, veteran benefits, environmental sustainability, and labor rights in the hope of gaining future protection or appeasing Musk and Trump,\" she said. \"Their mistake. Musk and Trump will continue taking more of our civil rights, programs, and resources unless we find the courage to stand our ground and fight back.\"\n\n\"Democrats cannot continue to move in a way that signals to the American people that they will not fight for them.\"\n\nRep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., agreed with Ramirez. \"The ultra-rich are buying off our democracy and moving us towards oligarchy and authoritarianism,\" said Lee, in a statement. \"Democrats cannot continue to move in a way that signals to the American people that they will not fight for them.\"\n\nAimee Allison, founder of She the People, an organization working to elevate the political power of women of color, argued that Democrats who have tried to placate Trump haven't gotten the scrutiny they deserve. \"We need to pay more attention to the cowardly capitulation of Democratic leadership and institutions to pave the way for Trump's misdeeds; Senate minority leader Schumer is exhibit one of failing the moment,\" she wrote to The Intercept. \"While the majority of democratic Senators pledge a no vote on cloture and refuse to cooperate with Republicans, he bends the knee. His weakness in the face of the bald-faced dismantling of our democratic institutions and the federal government is a liability.\"\n\nAllison said what happened with Columbia University was a perfect example of why appeasement failed.\n\n\"If the Columbia example teaches us anything, it's that capitulation does not gain time and doesn't gain power, and it certainly does not protect vulnerable people or our deeply held values,\" she said.\n\nJustin Hansford, a Howard Law professor and founder of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center, argued that capitulation had only emboldened Trump.\n\n\"The more that they cave in, the more damage that gets done,\" said Hansford. \"Not only has the caving not changed Trump's approach, he keeps ratcheting it up.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nBusiness leaders have also largely capitulated to Trump, rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and remaining silent about his ongoing trade war, even as tariffs threaten their bottom line.\n\n\"We get to determine the limits of presidential power by how much we push back.\"\n\nResistance is the only thing that's been effective thus far, argued Hansford. \"Thinking about situations in which people fought back. I mean, look at the lawsuits that froze attacks on DEI,\" said Hansford, pointing toward a lawsuit brought by Democracy Forward that led to a preliminary injunction of Trump's anti-DEI executive orders. Federal workers have also fought back and won, noted Hansford. Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to rehire thousands of federal probationary workers.\n\n\"The secret here is understanding how power works,\" said Hansford. \"If you do it, then he has the power to make you do it. If you take it to court, then he has to prove the limits of presidential power. In a real way, we get to determine the limits of presidential power by how much we push back.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "How Trump Twisted DEI to Only Benefit White Christians\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTrump's crusade against \"wokeness\" is co-opting the language of the civil rights movement to undo its legacy.\n\nAfter leaving the National Prayer Breakfast at the Capitol earlier this month, President Donald Trump and his entourage slipped into the imposing ballroom at the Washington Hilton, where the real show was about to begin.\n\nAt the \"unofficial\" event on February 6, organized by the powerful and insular evangelical group known as \"the Family,\" Trump took a victory lap before the crowd of largely white evangelicals. These were the voters who had thrust him into power, and they were eager to celebrate the rash of executive orders reversing decades-old civil rights advances.\n\n\"I don't know if you've been watching but we got rid of woke over the last two weeks. Woke is gone-zo,\" Trump said, to applause. \"We're a merit-based society now.\"\n\nWith an assist from Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Trump has made the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion a centerpiece of his new administration.  For all the crowing about his early success - much of it greatly overinflated - Trump has simply flipped the script: Instead of creating a level playing field, he launched DEI for white Christians.\n\nTrump's bid to dismantle the legacy of the civil rights movement while using its own language is part and parcel of the Christian right's playbook, according to Christine Reyna, a psychology professor at DePaul University who studies extremism.\n\n\"They've stumbled on a winning strategy, which is to portray white people as victims and portray their movement as a civil rights movement,\" Reyna said. \"And they've completely co-opted the strategies of the Black civil rights movement.\"\n\nAt the prayer event that morning, Trump announced the latest gift to his right-wing evangelical supporters: a task force on \"anti-Christian bias,\" helmed by his new Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\n\"[T]he task force will work to fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide,\" he said.\n\nTrump's war on \"woke\" is a realization of decades of political organizing that has always had civil rights in its crosshairs. Despite rhetoric about religious liberty, backsliding on civil rights and the far-right push to usher in a Christian theocracy are inextricably linked - and they always have been, according to Brad Onishi, a professor of religion at the University of San Francisco.\n\n\"There has been a war on the representation of rights of people they think don't deserve them or at least don't deserve to be at an equal seat of the American roundtable,\" said Onishi, himself a former evangelical Christian. \"It's something that's 60 years in the making.\"\n\nWhile discussions of the Christian right often focus on the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision as its origin story , the issue that truly launched the movement was integration .\n\nIn 1976, the Internal Revenue Service revoked the tax-exempt status of Bob Jones University, a fundamentalist college that banned interracial marriage on \"religious grounds\" and, until 1971, excluded Black applicants entirely.\n\nThe case, which eventually made its way to the Supreme Court along with similar efforts to desegregate religious institutions catalyzed white Christian outrage. Groups like the Moral Majority sprung up in defense of segregation , capitalizing on white evangelicals' feelings of grievance.\n\nAlthough later Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell Sr. would argue that Roe had been his breaking point, scholars have noted that the emergence of these efforts, including Falwell's, began before Roe and only incorporated anti-abortion stances into their platforms in the late 1970s.\n\nLike Trump, these organizations combined a promise of the restoration of Christianity to dominance in American political life with a staunch opposition to integration and other socially liberal trends in American life.\n\n\"The great white Christian flight from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party occurred primarily because the Democratic Party became the party defending the civil rights of Black Americans in this country,\" said Robert  P. Jones, founder of the Public Religion Research Institute and author of \"The Hidden Roots of White Supremacy and the Path to a Shared American Future.\"\n\nNow, said Jones, \"the two political parties have essentially sorted themselves along ethno-religious lines.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOver the last month, Trump has moved swiftly to turn white evangelicals' grievances into policy.\n\nIn a series of executive orders , the president undid decades worth of civil rights protections for marginalized communities, brick by brick. He froze the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, eliminated all DEI roles in the federal government, and dismantled equal opportunity executive orders barring racial discrimination in employment.\n\nOn the flip side, he formed the \"anti-Christian bias\" task force - announced with fanfare at \"the Family's\" prayer breakfast - and re-instituted the White House Faith Office , a bureau led by televangelist Paula White that consults religious leaders on policy.\n\nReyna, the DePaul professor, said that there's a legal benefit to couching the far right's movement in the terms of civil rights.\n\n\"What's especially powerful about this tactic is that civil rights laws already exist. They already are fundamental to our legal system,\" said Reyna. \"So if they could find a way to leverage those existing laws in order to protect whiteness in America, they're going to be more likely to be successful.\"\n\nTrump is by all accounts not a pious believer. He can, however, leverage evangelical grievances for support at the ballot box - and perhaps beyond.\n\n\"We essentially have kind of a MAGA-controlled Republican Party, that is, both in terms of its ideas and its demography, a white Christian Nationalist Party,\" said Jones, of the Public Religion Research Institute. \"The end game is the installation of an authoritarian regime that's about power and money and an oligarchy - and the ultimate end of that is the end of American democracy as we know it.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Latin America's New Right Ushers in Pan-American Trumpism\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe last right-wing American president before Trump galvanized a resurgent Latin American left. Where will the region go now?\n\nDonald Trump is a wild card in Latin America. Who will he galvanize more? His natural allies, including leaders who share many of his culture-war obsessions? Or politicians and activists who see in Trump the long history of U.S. conquest made flesh, who bristle at his threats to seize the Panama Canal and bomb fentanyl labs in Mexico?\n\nIn trying to answer these questions, it's helpful to take a moment to recall that Latin America, not too long ago, defied another controversial U.S. president on matters related to war and trade: George W. Bush.\n\nBy the time the Bush administration was gearing up for its 2003 invasion of Iraq, Latin America was beginning a remarkable run of elections. Leftists were coming to power in nearly every country south of Panama, many with ambitious agendas and outsized personalities. Among them were Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil, Néstor Kirchner in Argentina, and Evo Morales in Bolivia.\n\nFor a region that had long been under the sway of Washington, a run of dissent to Bush - dated, say, from Lula's first election to presidency in 2002 to Chávez's death from intestinal cancer in 2013 - was extraordinary and, for a time, extraordinarily successful. In Latin America, diplomats talked about a new \"polycentric world,\" while Beltway think tanks like the Council on Foreign Relations pronounced the Monroe Doctrine \"obsolete.\"\n\nA new generation of reactionaries draw energy from the tactics that animate Trumpism in the U.S.\n\nThe tide eventually turned. Where more traditional conservatives had found it hard to compete at the polls against politicians like Lula and Chávez, a new generation of reactionaries began to find their footing, drawing energy from the tactics and issues that animate Trumpism in the U.S. - an obsession with gender orthodoxy, a defense of patriarchy and Christian supremacy, and a love of cryptocurrency. Latin America's New Right stands opposed to \" wokeismo ,\" used, as it is in the U.S., as a catchall for a range of social policies aimed at lessening class, gender, and racial inequality.\n\nBy examining this rollercoaster of a Latin American quarter-century, we might gain some insight into what to expect from Donald Trump's second term, in Latin America and beyond.\n\nLatin America's leftist leaders of the aughts were resolute in their rejection of Bush's \"global war on terror,\" refusing to let their security forces participate in the CIA's transnational program of rendition and black-site torture. Brazil rebuffed U.S. demands to revise its legal code to make it easier to convict on terrorism charges; the governing Workers Party feared that such a move could be used, as one U.S. diplomat noted , to target \"legitimate social movements fighting for a more just society.\"\n\nIn 2005, Lula, Kirchner, and Chávez killed the much-anticipated Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, while Kirchner's take-it-or-leave-it negotiating strategy for restructuring of Argentina's national debt was held up as a model for lessening the debt burden of poor countries. Lula also worked to fortify the BRICS alliance as a counter to the World Trade Organization and resisted efforts to drive a wedge between Brazil and Venezuela.\n\nLatin American nations pushed for an end to economic sanctions on Cuba, denounced Washington's support of Israel's 2006 invasion of Lebanon, and complained that the prison camp the U.S. set up in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, was a mockery of international law. Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina ignored Washington's sanctions on Iran. Bolivia expelled the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2008 and USAID in 2014. Ecuador shut down a U.S. Air Force base. Most Latin American nations opposed NATO's 2011 bombing of Libya, which resulted in Muammar Gaddafi's downfall and execution.\n\nBeyond any single dissent, Brazil advocated for a \"Bolivarian\" interpretation of international law, organizing nations around alleviating poverty, global warming, food insecurity, and the ills of the drug war. Brazil, Lula's foreign minister said , has \"no enemies\" - notable, considering that Bush's neocons had marked out the entire globe as a battlefield. Venezuela reinforced Brazil's position, as Caracas worked with Cuba and Nicaragua to build an explicitly anti-imperialist bloc. High commodity prices, including for Chilean copper and Venezuelan oil, allowed governments to pursue ambitious social welfare programs, lifting millions out of poverty.\n\nBrazil waged a multifront campaign in the United Nations, WTO, and World Health Organization to break the monopoly on intellectual property held by pharmaceutical companies, insisting on its right to produce generic HIV/AIDS drugs and other \"essential medicines.\" Brazil won that fight , changing global norms and widening access to lifesaving treatment.\n\nLatin America's progressives began to lose their advantage, however, with the 2008 election of Barack Obama. Where Bush's braggadocio hardened hemispheric opposition, Obama's diplomats played a patient long game that brought the region back into the fold.\n\nObama stepped up domestic oil drilling and gas fracking, while encouraging Canada to increase its fuel and electricity exports into the United States. This was all done to greatly lower the cost of energy and to \" constrain \" Chávez, which it did.\n\nCoups in Honduras in 2009 and Paraguay in 2012 ousted moderate social democrats. Washington didn't orchestrate the overthrows, but Hillary Clinton's State Department did legitimate them and armed the men who carried them out.\n\nThose two small countries were low-hanging fruit. Brazil, with Venezuela contained, was the whole game.\n\nThere, Obama's Justice Department provided critical assistance to corrupt investigators leading a legal witch hunt against the governing Workers Party, resulting in Lula's imprisonment and the impeachment of his successor Dilma Rousseff. This \"lawfare\" campaign ultimately set the stage for the rise of the hard-right Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally in style and substance , who was elected president in 2018.\n\nThen, a federal judge in New York ruled that Kirchner's debt deal was invalid, obligating Argentina to pay its external debt in full. The judgment set loose the bond vultures on the country, sending its politics into a tailspin. Eventually, the pressure contributed to the 2023 election of Javier Milei, a self-declared anarcho-capitalist who never tires of shouting \"Viva la libertad, carajo\" - which roughly translates as \"Liberty, motherfucker.\"\n\nBolsonaro and Milei, along with El Salvador's Nayib Bukele, represent Trump's potential base of support in Latin America.\n\nDaniel Noboa, heir to a banana fortune, wouldn't have had a shot at Ecuador's presidency in, say, 2006, when Noboa's father ran and lost to Rafael Correa, a left economist. But the culture wars have given the oligarchy a new luster. Young Noboa has adopted a Trump-like persona, skilled at social media, selling himself as simultaneously pro-business and anti-establishment, pro-Israel and anti-woke. Having plastered the country with posters of his image alongside those of Trump, Marco Rubio, and Elon Musk, Noboa is running close behind the leftist Luisa González in a presidential election that will go to a runoff in April.\n\nMusk is a culture hero to men like Noboa, Milei, and Bukele; his fight against Brazil's efforts to regulate social media - carried out through legislation aimed at muting disinformation and limiting right-wing extremism - became a rallying cause for the region's conservatives. (Brazil so far has held Musk off, though Rumble and Trump's Truth Social have just filed a lawsuit in a U.S. court alleging illegal censorship.\n\nIn El Salvador, Bukele, a hip, baseball cap-wearing self-styled libertarian, presides over Dantesque displays of dehumanization: assemblies of hundreds of supposed gang members, their heads shaved, massed together naked and shackled. Held up as a model for not just for conservatives in Latin America, but up north , too, Bukele dispensed with due process, sparking the highest rate of incarceration in the Americas, higher even than the U.S. itself.\n\nPsychological campaigns to destabilize elected leftist and centrist governments by amplifying lies and manipulating the institutions of democracy - the press, the ballot box, and the law - are nothing new in Latin America. The CIA ran dozens of such operations in the region. What is novel about the New Right is the appearance of grassrootedness, the sense that pressure is building spontaneously from a multitude of sources, that the right represents not a defense of the status hierarchy but a desire for anti-systemic change.\n\nWhat is novel about the New Right is the appearance of grassrootedness.\n\nThe ties binding Latin America's New Right and its American counterparts are thickening, the result not of viral memes and social media posts but the organizing efforts of billionaire funders, conservative church leaders, libertarian activists, right-wing influencers like Steve Bannon , and political parties, such as Spain's Vox . Anti-vaccine predators target poor communities in Mexico the way they target poor communities in the U.S. Libertarians make common cause with anti-abortion and anti-trans activists, ultraorthodox Catholics, evangelical dominionists, Christian Zionists, and the Latin American branch of New Apostolic Reformation - recently highlighted as key to understanding Christian support for Trump.\n\nTrump could run the table in Latin America.\n\nWith former Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as his secretary of state and hard-liner Mauricio Claver-Carone his \"special envoy\" to Latin America, one could imagine a scenario where the U.S. takes Nicolás Maduro out; squeezes Cuba until it breaks; ousts Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua; keeps the Argentine peso artificially inflated to help Milei win congressional elections in October; and drives a deeper wedge between an already split left in Boliva, finally bringing about a rightist restoration in that lithium-rich nation. Both Chile and Colombia are governed by leftists with bad poll numbers . Who knows what conversations are being had to influence their upcoming elections.\n\nThen there is Brazil, where the charges against Lula have been thrown out, the investigation that led to his conviction shown to have been corrupt and politically motivated. Released from prison, Lula ran against and beat Bolsonaro in 2022, winning a third term as president. Bolsonaro responded to defeat by encouraging a putsch that would have kept him in power, including a plot to poison Lula . He's currently banned from running in Brazil's next presidential election, though his supporters have been lobbying Rubio to pressure Lula to find a way to to lift the ban and to let Nazis and antisemites post on Brazilian X.\n\nThis scenario - which includes not just a rollback of the left but a nurturing of a pan-American Trumpism - assumes coherence and patience that might be beyond Trump's capacity. Trump hasn't yet appointed ambassadors to Brazil and Colombia, nor an assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere. And the freezing of foreign aid to the region, including money earmarked for the security forces, limits Washington's room to maneuver.\n\nTrump will most likely, at least at first, pursue spasmodic action in the hemisphere. He's already flip-flopped twice on Venezuela. First Trump said Maduro had to go. Then it appeared that his administration made a deal where he could stay, and let Chevron pump oil. Most recently, however, he surprised Chevron by announcing he was revoking the company's waiver to work in Venezuela, apparently as part of a deal to keep Republican members of Congress in line during budget negotiations.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAs his presidency moves ahead, Trump will pick - according to his own impulses - fights with Latin America over China, migration, tariffs, deportation flights, and drug policy, and as he does, he'll blow the chance of building a unified hemispheric movement in his image. His repeated threats that he'll coerce Canada into becoming part of the U.S. has alienated him from Canadian conservatives. Colombians, according to one poll , mostly like Trump - but not if his continuing threats against Panama, which once was a Colombian province until the U.S. split it off in 1903 to build the canal.\n\nTrump's fickleness prevents him from putting forth a coherent foreign policy and building a durable international coalition. Yet this disadvantage is offset by the fragility of the Latin American left.\n\nFor now, activists continue to mobilize a wide variety of social movements aimed at making a fairer world and progressives continue to win elections. A rough regional count has more than 470,000,000 people, out of a total population of about 620,000,000, living in countries governed by presidents who call themselves socialists or social democrats.\n\nYet left politicians tread treacherous ground, unable to command the kind of rhetorical hegemony their comrades did two decades ago. Where Chávez energized the hemisphere's left, his hard-to-defend successor, Maduro, exhausts it, forcing Brazil, Colombia, and Chile to waste energy debating what to do about Venezuela.\n\nThe unity that existed when the region pushed back against Bush no longer exists.\n\nThe unity that existed when the region pushed back against Bush no longer exists. Each center-left country seems an island unto itself, their governments unable to pass their reform agenda and incapable of building stabilizing coalitions. Lula still works with the BRICS on efforts to find a currency other than the dollar to do business. \"Trump's tariff threats won't stop our determination,\" he said recently, to find a way to do business that \"doesn't depend on the dollar.\"\n\nHe is, however, boxed in at home, his popularity still frustratingly just a point or two above Bolsonaro, despite all of the latter's crimes. Lula may have to run again in 2026. If he does, it will be a sign of the center-left's weakness, not strength - an indication of Bolsonarismo's vitality and of its opponents' failure to offer an alternative, other than turning again to Lula, who will be 80 years old. Over the last few decades, a humane pope, raised in Peronist Argentina, has renewed progressive Christianity. The 88-year-old Pope Francis, though, is ill and weak, and ascendent Catholic reactionaries are giddy thinking he might not be long for the world.\n\nOnly Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum operates from a position of authority. Her expansion of the welfare state is enormously popular with Mexicans, with polls showing that a vast majority of the country backs her in her contretemps against Trump. Even as she delicately handles the U.S., she remains bold in putting forth a post neoliberal vision of social citizenship.\n\nElections are fought on a knife's edge, for the votes of citizens tired of crime, corruption, and inflation. In their weariness, the allure of being called to a fight is tempting. But it's mostly the New Right doing the mustering, filling the void created by the left's disorientation with politicized meaning. Left-wing hegemony has given way to an expansive right-wing conspiricism, a project of crypto-worldmaking ever more baroque in its details.\n\nAs in the U.S., Latin America's New Right composes its own demonology as it grows: globalists, Judith Butler , George Soros , climate scientists, reporters , government workers, especially teachers and public university professors, migrants, and imagined pedophiles . \"Con mis hijos no te metas\" - \"Don't Mess With My Kids\" - is the name of a Peruvian movement that has gained influence in the government, which last May decreed that intersex and transgender people were \"mentally ill.\" The phrase \"gender equality\" has been struck from Peru's school textbooks.\n\nMilei's support for Israel is as \" unwavering \" as is his backing of Trump, even if, for Milei, Trump's tariff policy poses a greater moral dilemma than Israel's genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe Argentine president's defense of \"freedom\" - by which he means market freedom - requires constant mobilization in support of causes at odds, at least in principle, with libertarianism, including laws restricting abortion; the persecution of transgender people ; collective mass incarceration ; and attacks on free speech, the right to protest and assembly, journalism, public education , and teachers. The point is to dominate public discussion, Milei says, to constantly expand the conservative imagination. Otherwise, the advantage will slip back to \"social justice\" activists.\n\nMilei, beloved by the editors of The Economist, has been recently implicated in cryptocurrency swindle. Argentine prosecutors have launched an investigation into the scam, and the evidence seems damning. The organizers of the con - apparently the same people who ran Melania Trump's coin sale - had channeled money to Milei's chief of staff, his sister Karina Milei. \"I control that n****,\" one of the accused in the scam texted, referring to the president. \"I send $$ to his sister and he signs whatever I say and does what I want.\"\n\nThe fragile imbalance between right and left power manifests in Latin America's stance toward Europe: As he did with Bush's earlier militarism, Lula has criticized the U.S. backing of Ukraine in its defense against Russia, insisting that only diplomacy can resolve a conflict decades in the making. For his part, Milei, when Joe Biden occupied the White House, pledged his undying support to Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"I was the first to defend Ukraine against Russia,\" he said ; \"You will always find me on the right side of history.\"\n\nMilei even announced that Argentina intended to join NATO, extending the North Atlantic military alliance to the South Atlantic, but then history changed sides. Now, courting Trump and needing Washington to approve a loan from the International Monetary Fund, Argentina has backed away from Zelenskyy, with Milei instructing his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain in a vote condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMilei seems unfazed by his faithlessness, holding himself up as a model for his own followers: \"Every day I relentlessly wage the culture war.\"\n\nViva la libertad, carajo .\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump Might Get Unfettered Surveillance Powers. How Did We Get Here?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFor a decade, Congress has failed to rein in the surveillance state. Now Trump is promising to use the government against his foes.\n\nIf Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, he will regain the keys to a global surveillance apparatus with few limits.\n\nPrivacy advocates have warned since Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 that the government's surveillance tools could be misused by presidents of any stripe. In the intervening decade, however, Congress has failed to rein in those powers.\n\nNow, Trump is preparing to retake office with a plan that includes deploying the military on domestic enemies . He would have at his disposal a program that compels American companies to cooperate with the National Security Agency, rules for \"foreign\" surveillance that changed at the stroke of a pen, and data peddlers who sell location information to the government .\n\n\"The only thing that really stands between a president misusing all of these authorities and not are the individuals who work in these agencies, who have sets of rules and standards that they follow,\" said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"But one of the things we have seen, on the side of President Trump, is that is something he is trying to eliminate.\"\n\nTrump spoke out loudly this spring against the reauthorization of a key spying law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\n\"KILL FISA, IT WAS ILLEGALLY USED AGAINST ME, AND MANY OTHERS. THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN!!!\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump was right that the law was used, by FBI agents who lied to a court to obtain warrants, to spy on his campaign. The debate raging in Congress when Trump sent out his message, however, centered on another part of the law that allows warrantless surveillance.\n\nUltimately, some Trump-aligned Republicans in Congress warmed up to the surveillance bill thanks to concessions that included a two-year \"sunset\" allowing Trump the chance to help rewrite the bill if he wins .\n\nStill on the books: a section of the law that allows \"backdoor\" searches of Americans' phone calls, emails, and text messages collected without a warrant because the government was ostensibly trying to collect foreign intelligence. The FBI alone conducted 200,000 such searches in 2022.\n\nAfter the Snowden revelations, advocates fought hard to pry open a window into warrantless surveillance. The view they gained has been troubling.\n\nThe FBI has violated its own rules thousands of times, including when searching for information on January 6 rioters and demonstrators protesting against the murder of George Floyd. The bureau also searched for information on 19,000 donors to a congressional campaign, according to a partially declassified document released in 2023.\n\nStill, the House of Representatives this year narrowly failed to approve a warrant requirement for searches about Americans, long one of the highest priorities for privacy advocates. The vote scrambled party lines, with some MAGA Republicans lining up with progressives in favor of a warrant.\n\nIf Trump wins, he would have a chance to haggle with Congress over the program. Many advocates, though, are skeptical that he would try to rein in warrantless surveillance. They note that he signed a similar spying law in 2018.\n\nPatrick Eddington, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former congressional aide, said he anticipates that Trump would try to purge perceived enemies rather than curb spying.\n\n\"He only hates the so-called deep state because the FBI went after him,\" Eddington said. \"So how do you solve that problem? You 'reform' the FBI. And I don't think there's any question that's what they have in mind.\"\n\nCohn said she fears in particular surveillance being misused to target immigrants - but she will fight for stricter limits on spying whether Trump or Kamala Harris is in office.\n\n\"I think EFF will be fighting this regardless of who wins the election,\" she said. \"The Democrats and Harris especially, they're not standing up for reforms of these things either. The Biden administration was supportive of this (FISA) extension.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAdvocates have won some victories since 2013, including greater oversight from a special surveillance court and more transparency. The latest reauthorization from Congress, however, includes a section that gives the government even greater power to compel companies to comply with its orders.\n\nApparently in an attempt to bring data centers under the law's reach , Congress rewrote it so broadly, critics say, that almost anyone could be forced to help the government spy.\n\n\"Whoever the next president is can go to the cleaning crew for the New York Times or The Intercept and compel them under gag without a warrant to 'facilitate' NSA access to those communication systems,\" said Sean Vitka, the policy director for Demand Progress. \"And it is incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., says he is trying to pass a \"fix\" for the law this year, but it is unclear whether he will succeed.\n\nWhile government critics have fought a decadelong battle for a warrant requirement in FISA, they warn there are other government authorities and emerging technologies that may pose just as big a threat.\n\nOne is Executive Order 12333 , signed in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, which is supposed to provide a framework for surveillance focused abroad.\n\n\"It's not a statute, it's not a law,\" Vitka said. \"In the executive branch's mind, it's the executive branch's own set of limits on its own inherent authority. However, the next president has a terrifying ability to rewrite those rules in secret and without notice.\"\n\nThen there is the government's growing reliance on private data brokers who have amassed massive quantities of data on ordinary Americans. Apps ranging from navigation to dating sell their data to the brokers, who turn around and sell it to the federal and local law enforcement agencies. The brokers' clients include the FBI , the DEA, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement .\n\nThe data also gets sold to private actors: One broker sold information about people who had visited Planned Parenthood clinics to an anti-abortion group.\n\nAs of now, the government argues that the information it buys from those brokers does not require a warrant.\n\n\"Even though you need a warrant to put a GPS tracker on a car for a month, they\" - courts - \"have not said the same thing about buying that information from a data broker scraping it out of your car or out of your phone,\" Vitka said.\n\nBeyond the programs that privacy advocates are already concerned about are the ones that haven't yet come to light.\n\nAdvocates noted that the Snowden revelations shocked the same members of Congress who had voted for the laws authorizing the surveillance, and that the George W. Bush administration used twisted legal interpretations to justify domestic surveillance for years before being exposed.\n\n\"It's been the failures of previous Congresses, Republican and Democrat, and previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, to recognize the absolutely toxic danger that a centralized, imperial presidency represents to the republic,\" Eddington said. \"We're perhaps on the cusp of seeing the effects of that, whether it's Trump or somebody like Trump down the road, being able to seize power and behave in fascistic, autocratic or even totalitarian ways.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "CIA Drove Spike in Media Leak Investigation Requests Under Trump\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRecords released by the Department of Justice provide new details about Trump's campaign against whistleblowers and leakers.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nNew data obtained by The Intercept adds considerable detail to what we already know about former President Donald Trump's relentless campaign against whistleblowers and leakers in the intelligence community. The Trump administration referred far more media leaks for criminal investigation each year than any of the previous 15 years, with the CIA accounting for the vast majority of such leaks, according to a trove of records released by the Department of Justice to the independent watchdog group Project On Government Oversight , or POGO, in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.\n\nThe DOJ records provide a previously unavailable level of detail on media leak referrals, including the originating agency, the date of the referral, and the classification level of the suspected disclosure. The records also show the CIA accounting for more than 64 percent of all referrals. The next most common agency, the National Security Agency, accounted for just 15 percent. The documents reveal a dramatic spike in the number of such leak referrals - called \"crime reports\" - from the CIA in 2017, when Mike Pompeo led the spy agency. Many of those referrals pertained to leaks that had taken place months and even years prior during the Obama administration, raising questions about why they were being revisited.\n\nAs The Intercept has previously reported , in 2017 the number of criminal leak referrals spiked to 120 - much higher than any other point since 2005. The number of referrals to Trump's Justice Department in 2018 was 88, with 71 in 2019, still considerably higher than the years before Trump became president. In the first three quarters of 2020, there were 55 referrals. More than twice as many leak referrals were sent to the Justice Department during the first three years of the Trump administration than in any other three-year period in the last decade-and-a-half.\n\nA database of \"crime reports,\" leaks or unauthorized disclosures of information referred to the National Security Division of DOJ since January 2007, and released in a FOIA lawsuit to the Project on Government Oversight.\n\nThere are likely several reasons for the CIA's outsize presence in the leak referrals, some more benign than others, according to current and former national security officials not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nA former CIA official pointed to the sheer frequency of leaks directly related to the Russia investigation. Media leaks about the Russia investigation were so commonplace that the former CIA official, upon being notified of one such leak in spring of 2017, recalled a senior CIA counterintelligence manager remarking, \"Well, that's another referral.\"\n\nThe former CIA official also pointed out that the agency simply produces so much \"originating\" intelligence - i.e., intelligence on which subsequent intelligence reports produced by other agencies are based - that leaks could appear to come from the CIA that might in fact have come from other entities using its intelligence. For example, the former CIA official recalled agency officials being in broad agreement that the leaks were largely coming not from Langley but from the House Intelligence Committee, which had access to CIA intelligence as part of its oversight duties. Other explanations for the relative prominence of the CIA in the leak referrals include, as one former senior FBI official who worked on leak cases bluntly put it, \"The CIA fucked up the [Aldrich] Ames case so bad\" that the embarrassing spy scandal resulted in the FBI's permanent presence in the CIA's counterintelligence center. And while the military could contribute referrals, it much prefers, as a senior Pentagon official put it, to keep leak investigations within the military justice system. However, these factors do not account for the rise of referrals under Trump.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAmid recent revelations of the Trump administration's efforts to obtain the communications records of reporters from CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, the new DOJ documents reveal the most complete picture yet assembled of a leak-hunting effort that dwarfs those of previous administrations. In the recently revealed cases, gag orders prevented news executives and tech companies from revealing the secret subpoenas. In May, President Joe Biden announced that he would not permit the seizure of reporters' records, apparently unaware that his own Justice Department was attempting to do just that and had obtained a gag order against the New York Times. After it was lifted, the Biden White House claimed that it knew nothing about the Times gag order, and the Justice Department soon announced a new policy regarding reporters in leak investigations.\n\n\"We need a full accounting of what happened in these three cases, and we need to know how these three secret record seizures are linked to the 2017 anti-leak initiative,\" said Gabe Rottman, a program director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Rottman has been tracking the government's attempts to prosecute sources and spy on journalists.\n\nAlthough only some leak referrals lead to investigations, and a small fraction are likely to result in criminal charges, the raw number of referrals under the Trump administration could mean that more prosecutions will eventually emerge. But even without a formal prosecution, a government investigation can seriously impact a federal employee's personal and professional life and cost a considerable sum in defense attorney's fees - and chill others from disclosing information.\n\nWhile the government redacted large swaths of information in the records, including the names of the news articles associated with each suspected disclosure, we were able to identify some articles that generated referrals and some that likely did. Some referrals have led to indictments, and several seem to line up with the prosecutions during the Trump administration of Reality Winner, Terry Albury, Daniel Hale, and Henry Kyle Frese.\n\nFrom the beginning of his presidency, Trump made no secret of his animosity toward the press and his eagerness to prosecute suspected leakers. \"I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks,\" Trump said during a February 2017 press conference . \"Those are criminal leaks.\"\n\nIn July 2017 , he said, \"I want the attorney general to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies, which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before at a very important level.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions obliged, announcing in August 2017 that \"referrals for investigations of classified leaks to the Department of Justice from our intelligence agencies have exploded\" and \"since January, the Department has more than tripled the number of active leak investigations compared to the number pending at the end of the last Administration.\"\n\nSessions elaborated further in a November 2017 congressional hearing that there were 27 investigations open at the time versus nine investigations opened into media leaks over the last three years under President Barack Obama. In 2017, the FBI also created a media leaks unit to deal with \"the complicated nature of - and rapid growth in - unauthorized disclosure and media leak threats.\" The media leaks unit was largely focused on leaks relating to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to the former senior FBI official.\n\nIn April 2019, Sessions's successor as attorney general, William Barr, staged a news conference on the Mueller report in which he again explained how much animus Trump continued to hold toward insiders who disclosed information to the press, especially in relation to the Russia investigation. Referring to actions by Trump that were described in the Mueller report as potential examples of obstruction of justice, Barr said that \"the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks.\"\n\nOn at least 123 occasions during his presidency, Trump tweeted or retweeted messages decrying leakers.\n\nData compiled from DOJ records of \"crime reports,\" leaks or unauthorized disclosures from 2007 to 2019. This doesn't necessarily mean the leaks were coming from within the CIA, but that the CIA was the originating agency of the leaked information.\n\nTrump's obsession with leakers was not lost on his subordinates. On January 12, 2017, eight days before Trump was inaugurated, then-Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee as it considered his nomination for CIA director. Facing a question from Sen. Angus King, I-Maine., regarding \"media reports that there were contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russians,\" Pompeo quickly pivoted, responding, \"There are a number of very serious things that have taken place. The leaks that have occurred as well I consider to be intensely serious, too.\"\n\nIn his first press interview after being confirmed as CIA director, in July 2017, Pompeo signaled that combating leaks was a high priority. He told the Washington Free Beacon that \"the media's insatiable demand for leaks presents enormous risks to the United States of America.\"\n\n\"I am confident that this administration is going to do its level best, once the secrets are out, to identify those who did them,\" Pompeo said.\n\nThis wasn't just rhetoric. The CIA under Pompeo's leadership sent a torrent of criminal leak referrals to the Justice Department regarding news stories that the agency believed relied on classified information. In 2017, the CIA sent 75 media leak crime reports to the DOJ - far more than any other year stretching back to 2007.\n\nYet a deeper look shows that, in a shift from normal CIA practice, most of the CIA's media leak referrals under Pompeo were based on alleged leaks that had occurred during the Obama administration.\n\nOver the 10 years prior to 2017, 93 percent of the CIA's referrals to the Justice Department occurred in the same year that the CIA opened a file on a suspected leak to the press. In 2017, that only occurred 41 percent of the time, suggesting that the agency conducted a look-back investigation under Pompeo to identify leaks.\n\nWhile he could not speak to referrals from the CIA specifically, David Laufman, a former Justice Department official, said in an interview that \"it did seem to me that in response to the White House's pressure to crack down harder on leaks, there was a surge in referrals, and that surge was accompanied by what can fairly be described as a higher percentage of weak referrals that did not merit even a recommendation to open an investigation.\"\n\nWhen agencies send referrals to the Justice Department, the department requests that they answer 11 questions to help it assess whether an investigation should proceed. The list includes questions such as whether the published material is true and whether it could be declassified for use during a prosecution. As a result, an investigation could indirectly confirm that a news story is true, and a prosecution could end up leading to more public revelations. These are potential disincentives for the government to investigate and prosecute.\n\nMost of the older media leak cases the CIA sent to the Justice Department in 2017 were originally opened by the spy agency in 2016, though some dated to 2014 and 2015. Generally, older cases are more difficult to prosecute since the memories of witnesses and suspects often fade and evidence can be harder to obtain.\n\nMike Pompeo, former director of the CIA and U.S. secretary of state nominee under President Donald Trump, listens during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, D.C., on April 12, 2018.\n\nIn April 2018, Pompeo became secretary of state. Within months, his senior aides launched leak investigations after news stories emerged detailing internal deliberations within the State Department, according to reporting by Axios, despite the fact that the information at issue was not classified. \"The unauthorized release of information, whether it's classified or not, is always a concern of the State Department,\" Pompeo's spokesperson said.\n\nThe records released to POGO show no criminal referrals from the State Department during the Trump administration, and in 2018 and 2019, the CIA shifted back toward the norm of sending media leak referrals to the Justice Department during the same year that the agency opened a case on the suspected classified leak.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment.\n\nThe political pressure on the Justice Department was acute. Investigators in the DOJ's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, the focal point for the government's criminal leak efforts when classified information is involved, reported frequent high-level meetings regarding leaks.\n\nThe Justice Department was \"pursuing leak investigations with considerable vigor,\" but under the Trump administration, \"the climate for undertaking this work certainly intensified,\" said Laufman, who supervised the Justice Department's investigations of media leaks from late 2014 through early 2018.\n\nAlthough he does not condone the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to the press, Laufman said the tension between protecting First Amendment activity and national security secrets is a \"classic collision of two separate and important constitutional interests\" that can be difficult to navigate even in normal times.\n\nLaufman emphasized that he did not recall any circumstances during his time at the Justice Department in which there was any pressure to overrule the assessment of a career attorney in a case involving the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to the press. \"We did not alter our standards for evaluating these referrals and for assessing whether investigations should be opened,\" he said. \"I have high confidence that career attorneys at the National Security Division - the line attorneys and their supervisors - who evaluate leak referrals and their prosecutorial merit will not allow political considerations to intrude on their work.\"\n\nBut it seemed to Laufman that the agencies were eager to demonstrate that they were \"on the team\" in supporting the administration's crackdown on leaks.\n\nAnd political appointees, who generally want to please the White House, can influence the makeup of cases that go before the Justice Department's career prosecutors who investigate leaks. \"It appears that in many agencies, politically connected appointees exercise substantial control\" over what leaks get referred to the DOJ, according to Columbia Law School professor David Pozen, who published a study of leaks in the government in the Harvard Law Review in 2013. And given that the DOJ often consults with the agency referring the matter over whether an investigation is warranted, \"the referral process can give an effective veto to the leadership of critical agencies,\" Pozen wrote.\n\n\"The drumbeat of complaints about leaks from the president and other senior officials may have incentivized agencies to file more criminal referrals with DOJ about suspected leaks, including many that in the past might have been ignored or handled administratively within the agency,\" said Steven Aftergood, an expert on government secrecy with the Federation of American Scientists who has previously obtained aggregate numbers of referrals.\n\nThe National Security Division of the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump's war on leakers was not without precedent. The Obama administration was severely criticized for its increased prosecutions of people for giving the press sensitive information. Obama's crackdown received broad support from the national security establishment.\n\nA handful of the referrals in the new FOIA records appear to correspond with the publication of material that former Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning provided to WikiLeaks and that former NSA contractor Edward Snowden provided to journalists. Those episodes showed that digital technology empowered insiders to rapidly download and distribute vast numbers of government records - a far cry from the days of Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo, who photocopied thousands of pages of the Pentagon Papers and then had to physically transport that multivolume secret history of the Vietnam War.\n\nOn February 22, 2010, four days after WikiLeaks published its first State Department cable regarding Iceland , which was provided by Manning, the State Department made one of its only criminal referrals in the period between 2007 through 2019. And on June 6, 2013, the same day The Guardian published its first story based on NSA records leaked by Snowden showing how surveillance programs were scooping up huge amounts of information on Americans' communications, the NSA made two criminal referrals to the Justice Department.\n\nThese bulk leak cases, in which large numbers of secret government documents were disclosed, particularly angered many in Congress and the national security establishment. They led to Espionage Act prosecutions, including the successful conviction of Manning. Snowden left the U.S. before his role in disclosing the records became public and currently resides in Russia, out of reach of U.S. law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe same day The Guardian published its first story based on Snowden records, the NSA made two criminal referrals.\n\nUsing the Espionage Act to prosecute journalists has generally been a line that the Justice Department has been wary of crossing. In 2010, former CIA case officer Jeffrey Sterling was indicted under the act for allegedly leaking to reporter James Risen, then at the New York Times, for material published in his book \"State of War.\" Risen refused to testify against or reveal his source and faced prison time as an alternative. The Obama administration renewed the Bush-era subpoena but eventually dropped the case, establishing a precedent that worried many in the press freedom world. In 2019, the Justice Department charged the head of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, with violating both the Espionage Act and an anti-hacking law for agreeing to help Manning crack a Defense Department password.\n\nOther referrals in the FOIA records seem to line up with articles that have not yet led to indictments. For instance, less than a month after USA Today disclosed new details of a massive secret warrantless surveillance program conducted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department in May 2015 - the only one it filed from 2007 through the end of 2019. The USA Today story noted that part of the intelligence program it exposed \" remained classified .\"\n\nUnlike in the case of Manning or Snowden, who each single-handedly provided vast numbers of records, USA Today's reporting relied on interviews with more than a dozen current and former government officials, and the broad outlines of the DEA program, which had been shuttered, had been previously reported.\n\nShortly after USA Today published details of a massive DEA surveillance program, the agency sent a criminal referral to DOJ.\n\nWhile technology has made bulk disclosures by people like Manning and Snowden possible, it has also made investigations of leaks easier, said Paul Rosenzweig, a former federal prosecutor. Agency computer systems log when users access or print out documents, and video surveillance systems track employees' physical movements at work. Such insider threat programs gained steam under Obama, especially after the Manning and Snowden disclosures, and supercharged agency electronic monitoring efforts. The ability to pinpoint people's locations through their cellphones; the ubiquity of email, social media, and other forms of digital communication; and the electronic trails left by web browsers have made formerly difficult leak investigations much easier. \"All the things that are making it easier to track dissidents, to people buying diapers at Target, to tracking spies ... those tools can be used to unravel who's leaking and their journalist contacts,\" said Rosenzweig, who co-edited a 2015 book on whistleblowers.\n\nAgencies have been quick to defend the insider threat programs as crucial to national security, but these surveillance programs, and the prosecutions arising from them, often conflate whistleblowers who expose government wrongdoing with terrorists and spies. As a federal watchdog warned in 2018, they threaten to chill lawful whistleblowing and investigations into corruption and other government wrongdoing.\n\nAlthough criticism of the Obama administration's crackdown had been mounting for years, it boiled over in 2013, when one especially alarming leak investigation came to light. Bipartisan outrage prompted Obama's Justice Department to take steps to scale back its aggressive criminal enforcement of media leak cases.\n\nDuring April and May 2012, the Justice Department and FBI secretly wiretapped more than 20 Associated Press phone lines. Although the department never explained why it wiretapped the phones, on May 7, 2012, the Associated Press published a report on how U.S. intelligence foiled a planned terrorist attack on civilian airlines using bombs hidden in underwear. Although an investigation was already underway, the AP's story led the CIA to file a media leak crime report with the Justice Department, according to Reuters .\n\nThe wiretapping became publicly known the next year. Around this same time, news also broke that Obama's Justice Department had described a Fox News reporter as an unindicted \"co-conspirator\" in an Espionage Act case in a court filing.\n\n\"These new revelations suggest a pattern of intimidation by the Obama administration,\" said Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, then the Republican majority leader in the House.\n\nThe criticism led the Justice Department to shift its posture. A July 2013 report by Attorney General Eric Holder said the DOJ \"will work with others in the Administration to explore ways in which the intelligence agencies themselves, in the first instance, can address information leaks internally through administrative means, such as the withdrawal of security clearances and imposition of other sanctions.\"\n\nA shift appears to have occurred. The new FOIA records show a decrease in media leak referrals to the Justice Department in the last two years of the Obama administration, particularly from the CIA.\n\nBut that didn't mean prosecutions and investigations were off the table. Though fewer in number, cases continued to be referred, and ongoing investigations continued, some which were years in the making.\n\nOne such Obama-era investigation zeroed in on retired Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright , who was sometimes called Obama's \"favorite general,\" for the disclosure of classified information to New York Times reporter David Sanger and Newsweek's Daniel Klaidman regarding a covert cyberattack on Iran's nuclear program.\n\nTwo weeks after Klaidman published an article on February 13, 2012, the NSA sent three referrals to the Justice Department alleging that \"Top Secret Codeword\" information had been disclosed to the press, according to the records POGO obtained. A week after the Times's Sanger published an article on June 1, 2012, Holder assigned the case to Rod Rosenstein, a U.S. attorney whose jurisdiction in Maryland included the NSA.\n\nTwo weeks after Newsweek published an article on a covert cyberattack on Iran's nuclear program, the NSA sent three criminal referrals to the DOJ, alleging that \"Top Secret Codeword\" information had been disclosed.\n\nFour-and-a-half years later, in October 2016, the Justice Department issued a press release announcing that Cartwright had pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents in connection with the unauthorized disclosure of top secret information to journalists.\n\nThe case against Cartwright - and another against former CIA director David Petraeus - was among the very few leak investigations against top officials that led to criminal charges. Many commenters have remarked on the disparity in treatment between lower-level employees who disclosed concerns who were prosecuted and the widespread impunity for senior appointees who leaked seemingly self-serving information. In one case, a top Obama appointee released classified materials to the filmmakers of \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" which dramatized the manhunt for Osama bin Laden and portrayed the Obama administration in a positive light. A McClatchy story reported that the Pentagon sent the Justice Department a referral in September 2012, which the records obtained by POGO also show. The case against that official did not lead to an indictment.\n\n\"The Justice Department's internal investigations are designed to serve the department's own interests and the interests of its high-ranking officials,\" said Mike Zummer, a former FBI agent and founder of Protect the FBI, a whistleblower advocacy group. \"Thus, DOJ internal investigators cover up wrongdoing by higher-level officials - unless under external pressure from the media or Congress - while they abuse their authority to intimidate lower-level employees and keep them from exposing embarrassing department misconduct.\"\n\nThe Cartwright case held some promise that there might not be impunity that time around. \"People who gain access to classified information after promising not to disclose it must be held accountable when they willfully violate that promise,\" said Rosenstein in an October 2012 statement.\n\nThree days before Trump's inauguration - and on the same day Cartwright was scheduled to be sentenced - Obama pardoned Cartwright. Obama also commuted Manning's 35-year sentence, which many had criticized for being excessively harsh, after she had served seven years.\n\nRetired Gen. James Cartwright, right, arrives for a hearing with attorney Greg Craig, left, on Oct. 17, 2016, in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe full effects of the Trump administration's crackdown on leaks of classified information may not be realized for many years. Many cases that led to indictments under Obama - such as that of NSA whistleblower Tom Drake - began when George W. Bush was president and took years to investigate. And recent revelations of the Trump administration's attempts to seize journalists' digital communication records and call records connected to members of Congress are leading to calls for more transparency and accountability, with the Justice Department's inspector general launching a review .\n\nAll governments attempt to manage and manipulate public opinion and perception, and perhaps nowhere is a president's power to shape public awareness more powerful than in the realm of national security.\n\n\"The purpose of the national security classification system is to protect national security from the damage that could result from disclosure of certain types of highly sensitive information - such as pending military operations, identities of intelligence sources, advanced weapon technologies, and so on,\" said Aftergood, the Federation of American Scientists expert. \"But the power to classify information, which is largely rooted in presidential authority, also implies the ability to shape and influence public awareness.\"\n\nUnauthorized disclosures to the press thus threaten to undermine the control the president and top political appointees have in that system. The desire to wield total control is why the Justice Department has for decades fought against legislation that would allow whistleblowers to go directly to Congress with classified information. Ironically, the lack of adequate whistleblower protections actually incentivizes unauthorized leaks.\n\n\"In a democratic country where the government is elected by its citizens, the contest for public support can easily become a battleground, and classification - or selective disclosure - can be a potent weapon,\" Aftergood said. \"So it's really fundamentally important that classification be practiced sparingly and with as much integrity as possible.\"\n\nThis need is compounded in an era awash with well-funded, deliberate political misinformation . Yet it'll be harder to know if the government is lying or otherwise obscuring the truth if knowledgeable voices on the inside are silenced partly by the fear that they'll face criminal investigation for revealing information that in many cases shouldn't be secret at all.\n\n\"Things can be complicated, and we need to perceive reality as accurately as possible,\" said Aftergood, who has studied government secrets for nearly three decades. \"Sometimes leaks can help.\"\n\nPOGO is a nonpartisan, independent watchdog group focused on government ethics, accountability, and transparency.

      "text": "Donald Trump Is Even More Unhinged Than We Thought\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe January 6 hearings may be the best congressional inquiry since the Church Committee's legendary investigation of the intelligence community in the 1970s.\n\nAn image of former President Donald Trump is displayed on a screen during a hearing of the House January 6 committee in Washington, D.C., on July 12, 2022. Photo: Doug Mills/The New York Times/Bloomberg via Getty Images At the end of Tuesday's hearing of the House January 6 committee, Rep. Liz Cheney revealed yet one more bombshell from a congressional investigation that has been full of them.\n\nAn image of former President Donald Trump is displayed on a screen during a hearing of the House January 6 committee in Washington, D.C., on July 12, 2022.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, Cheney said, called a witness who is planning to testify at a future House hearing, in an apparent attempt to influence their upcoming testimony. Cheney did not identify the witness but said that the committee was alerted about the call by the witness's lawyer. Trump called the witness in the last few days - after the committee's previous hearing, in which former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson delivered explosive testimony about Trump's volatile behavior on January 6. The committee has referred the matter to the Justice Department for investigation into possible witness tampering by Trump.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe January 6 committee's investigation into the insurrection and Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election has turned into perhaps the best congressional inquiry since the Church Committee's legendary investigation of the intelligence community in the 1970s. The House committee has patiently and meticulously laid out the evidence of Trump's illegal efforts to overturn the election and incite a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, making it clear, once and for all, that he was the puppet master behind the surging mob seeking to prevent the congressional certification of Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn fact, the allegation of witness tampering by Trump is just the latest in a series of possible criminal acts disclosed by the committee. In seven hearings so far, the committee has portrayed the former president's behavior as far worse than was previously known. The House committee has uncovered much more than the media ever expected and has provided mountains of evidence that should be used by the Justice Department to intensify its criminal investigation of Trump and his cronies.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, the committee showed that Trump carefully planned to incite the mob to march on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, when Congress was meeting to certify the election results. In fact, the leaders of the rally held outside the White House on January 6 knew in advance that Trump was planning to urge the crowd to go to the Capitol. \"POTUS is going to have us march there/the Capitol,\" said Kylie Jane Kremer, a rally organizer, in a January 4, 2021, text message shown by the committee.\n\nThe committee also showed that Trump decided to incite the insurrection after all of his other illicit efforts to overturn the election had failed. Tuesday's hearing focused in part on a bizarre meeting at the White House on December 18, 2020, in which Trump surrounded himself with conspiracy theorists, including attorney Sidney Powell and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, to discuss seizing voting machines. Pat Cipollone, Trump's former White House lawyer, testified about how he fought the crazed ideas coming from the people whispering to Trump in his final days in the White House. Right after the marathon meeting ended in the middle of the night, Trump began to incite an insurrection. At 1:42 a.m. on December 19, he wrote a tweet urging his supporters to come to Washington. \"Be there, will be wild.\"\n\nTuesday's astonishing hearing added to the portrait of an unhinged Trump that was sketched by Hutchinson in her June 28 hearing. Hutchinson, a key aide to Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows, disclosed that Trump knew that some in the crowd on January 6 were armed and still urged them to go to the Capitol. She also revealed that Trump wanted to go to the Capitol to lead the crowd and that he tried to grab the steering wheel from a Secret Service agent when his detail refused to take him there.\n\nThe hearings of the January 6 committee, including Hutchinson's testimony, have been must-see television, depicting Trump as a psychopath and a criminal who sought to turn the U.S. into a dictatorship.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nIf you're hoping Social Security will avoid devastating cuts with the confirmation of Donald Trump's nominee for Social Security Administration head, Frank Bisignano, we have some bad news about his track record.\n\nFrank Bisignano speaking during an interview with Bloomberg in New York on February 19, 2015. (Victor J. Blue / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFor most people, Frank Bisignano is known for two things: being the president and CEO of Fiserv, and now President Donald Trump's nominee to head the Social Security Administration (SSA). Within Fiserv he's known for something else: overseeing a pitiless program of rolling layoffs in the name of cutting costs.\n\nMaybe no part of the Trump administration's program of dismantling federal government agencies has generated as much concern as its drastic cuts to the SSA, the agency responsible for trillions of dollars' worth of payments to retirees, people with disabilities, and millions of other Americans, and which is already seeing its workers laid off en masse, its offices shuttered, and some of its core services ended.\n\nIf Bisignano is confirmed, the White House may soon have an ideal ally in this effort: as chief executive of both Fiserv and First Data before that, he has been responsible for cuts to worker benefits, branch closings, and thousands of layoffs.\n\nSince Bisignano took over as CEO of the payment processing firm in July 2020, Fiserv has been steadily shedding jobs in the face of rising costs, though it has been cagey about revealing exactly how many. As reported by trade publication Payments Dive , the company claimed for years in public filings and statements that it still has \"about 44,000\" employees worldwide, while also disclosing that its number of foreign employees had increased - suggesting that jobs had been offshored from the United States - and that its termination costs had jumped from $32 million in 2019 to $131 million in 2020, the year Bisignano took over.\n\nLayoffs at the company kept at a steady tick over the years, whether the one hundred positions cut in Dublin, Ohio, in 2020, the three thousand workers (or roughly 7 percent of its workforce) it disclosed cutting in 2023, or the staff reduction it admitted to on December 5 last year (the same day Bisignano was officially tapped to lead the SSA), which one analyst estimated meant the laying off of anywhere between another 2.4 and 3.7 percent of its workforce.\n\n\"The changes that were made were basically hostile toward workers,\" one longtime Fiserv employee who requested anonymity to avoid reprisal told Jacobin . \"Layoffs were a regular occurrence.\"\n\n\"Ever since I started, Frank's style started to take over: more cutthroat, profit at all costs,\" says another current employee.\n\nThough the firm has played down the size of workforce reductions and avoided disclosing specific figures, current and former employees have regularly complained over the years about major job cuts on websites like Glass Door, where employees rate their current and former workplaces. Multiple Glass Door reviews put \"constant layoffs\" on their list of cons of working there, with employees over the years describing the layoffs as \" many ,\" \" quite high ,\" \" common ,\" and \" happening monthly at this point .\"\n\n\"Bad leadership; non-visionary; Layoff is in the policy,\" one former manager, who had worked for the firm for five years, wrote in May 2021. Fiserv has, at the time of writing, a dismal rating of 2.8 out of five stars from nearly ten thousand reviews on the website, with Bisignano himself holding an approval rating of only 33 percent.\n\nEven ostensibly positive reviews, meaning those giving three stars or more, alluded to the same issues. \"Always short staffed, systems always having issues. Queues never end,\" states a September 2024 review . \"Regular redundancies always hanging over you can be unsettling,\" reads one of the cons from a review earlier that year. \"There are too many departments and factions that are busy defending their headcount and budget from the constant staffing cuts to focus on improving client service,\" a portfolio manager and five-year-veteran of the company wrote in 2023.\n\nFiserv employees describe seeing long-serving, valuable workers with deep institutional knowledge (\"really high-caliber players\") serially laid off, with one team being reduced from around twenty to only two people, even as the size of the workload stayed more or less the same. In one round of layoffs this past year, despite an abundance of more private spaces, workers were simply called into a room in full view of the other employees to be given the bad news, before leaving the rooms visibly upset.\n\n\"They kind of put on a little show,\" the longtime employee recalls. \"I'm not saying that was intentional. But there wasn't much thought to spare anyone's privacy or respect. It's almost sadistic, cruel.\"\n\nThat employee's grievances are echoed by the firm's workers online: raises becoming minimal, remote work eliminated, workplace surveillance software installed, workers required to clock in and out and spend a minimum number of hours in office, and benefits like the employee stock discount reduced while health insurance deductibles grew.\n\nIn the quest for a tax break, the company in 2022 built an office in New Jersey's Berkeley Heights, for which it reported closing roughly one hundred offices around the United States, and about which employees complained they were given an ultimatum: relocate from wherever they were in the country, or lose their jobs. The employees Jacobin spoke to confirmed workers had been offered such an ultimatum, regarding both the New Jersey hub and others.\n\n\"Fiserv under its current management cares about nothing more than tax cuts and tax incentives,\" one September 2024 review from an employee of more than ten years charged. \"They have been obsessed with moving positions (not people - they don't seem to care that they are losing droves of knowledgeable people) to certain locations where they get tax incentives.\"\n\nOther objections likewise pop up again and again in employee reviews: no flexibility, zero work-life balance, a toxic work culture, a lack of parking and bathrooms, and management that treats its workers like robots instead of people.\n\n\"A lot of the best people end up leaving because they don't want to work at a place that offers zero flexibility when they could work somewhere else,\" an employee told Jacobin .\n\nFor disgruntled workers, there is a clear explanation for this. \"Many complain that the CEO puts the stock before the employees,\" one four-star review states, echoing a frequent charge. In his January 2025 ethics disclosure , Bisignano reported holding between $5 and 25 million in Fiserv stock, after selling more than $25 million of stock in September 2024. In public filings, the company has disclosed carrying out more than $17 billion in stock buybacks since the 2019 merger, including $5.5 billion in 2024 alone.\n\nMany reviews date the deterioration in working conditions and company culture to its 2019 merger with FirstData and Bisignano's subsequent ascendance to chief executive. One charged that all the pros of working for Fiserv were \"until First Data took over,\" at which point it became \"a slow demise into hell for the common employee.\" \"The downward spiral of morale can be pointed to post merger with FirstData and the change of CEOs,\" states another. \"Was great until FirstData came along,\" reads one from 2021. \"New CEO is ravaging the company from inside out.\"\n\nIn fact, Fiserv's Glass Door reviews are riddled with bitter personal animus to Bisignano specifically: \"The decision making in this company has been extremely erratic since Frank Bisignano took over as CEO\"; \"Once Frank took over, it became a horrible place to work for\"; \"Frank and his squad, not the greatest tbh\"; \"The CEO is a micromanager and only cares about the stock price\"; \" Replace Frank with a leader who listens.\"\n\n\"CEO could care less about employees. They are all a widget and an expense to him. Mr Scrooge at his finest ,\" concluded one . \"Frank, please go buy an island and move there, never to return.\"\n\n\"It's almost entirely negative. There's a lot of distrust for Frank,\" a Fiserv employee told Jacobin about employee attitudes toward Bisignano. \"When the announcement came out about him leaving and he had a town hall, people were in a really good mood about that, about the prospect of him being gone.\"\n\nWhat happened at Fiserv could have been predicted from Bisignano's tenure at First Data, another payment processor that saw a similar cycle of layoffs, downsizing, and stock pumping over the six years he was CEO.\n\nWhen Bisignano came aboard in 2013, the credit card processor was laden with more than $22 billion in debt owing to a familiar phenomenon: a leveraged buyout by a private equity firm six years earlier. Despite talking up his reputation as a \"builder\" who liked \"to improve things\" by \"investing in our people\" and who would avoid cuts, cuts are exactly what happened.\n\nAlmost immediately, First Data started laying off workers - one hundred employees at their founding office in Omaha in July, hundreds more in Denver that November - and began offering workers the choice of either joining a three-month performance improvement plan with the potential for no severance pay if they failed or leaving their jobs. By 2015, it announced a cost-reduction plan that would involve \"a few thousand\" more layoffs and offshoring of jobs, tipped to save the indebted company $200 million a year by the middle of 2016, as well as the closure of smaller facilities nationwide and around the world.\n\n\"In many cases, we've eliminated a lot of jobs,\" Bisignano said on a call with analysts, adding that they had \"also moved a lot offshore. . . . Expect more of that going forward.\"\n\nThose who kept their jobs saw benefits reduced. Before his first year as CEO was over, Bisignano barred employee spouses from qualifying for the company health care benefit plans, ended the company's matching contributions to employee retirement accounts, and reduced managers' cash bonuses.\n\nAll of it was meant to help pay down debt in advance of the company's October 2015 initial public offering (IPO), in which employees were given a stake in the form of hundreds of shares each as a way to make up for cuts to retirement and other benefits. The idea was that it would all be worth it once Bisignano eventually took the company public.\n\nIt didn't work out that way. Tipped to be one of the biggest IPOs of 2015, First Data badly underperformed when the time came, with shares selling for substantially lower than officially predicted by the company, netting it a little more than half of the $5 billion it had expected to make. When adjusted for the 10 million shares held by executives, workers were left holding an average of just $42,000 worth of stock each. Unable to sell the shares until 180 days after the IPO, they watched the stock price further fall, at one point tumbling below $10, and ending up more or less where it started by the time they were able to sell.\n\nBut the move was very good for the twenty-three First Data executives and directors who held roughly one-seventh of the company shares - and one in particular: Bisignano, who alone held more than half of that number, or close to 5.5. million. The IPO left his stock holdings valued at more than $86 million. That was on top of his status as the highest paid CEO in Georgia, earning as much as $51 million in 2016 and $102 million in 2018 - even as the company had posted consistent losses totaling in the billions.\n\nFor anyone concerned about the news coming out of the SSA under its acting commissioner - of mass layoffs, closures, and cuts that all serve to make the agency less functional for the millions who rely on it - Bisignano's nomination won't put them at ease. His record at both Fiserv and Fist Data before that suggests that these very actions have been some of his leading skills as an executive.\n\nBisignano's nomination hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday, where his public record will come under greater public scrutiny. Whether Democrat or Republican, senators owe it to the US public to defend Social Security benefits from being ravaged in the same way that Fiserv employees widely charge has been done to their workplace.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Such witch hunts never stop at their original targets.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Thursday, March 13, 2025.

We're seeing this with the Donald Trump administration's (and broader right-wing) crackdown on speech criticizing Israel, which yesterday was used to fire one of the administration's own foreign policy picks.\n\nYesterday the news that Lt. Col. Daniel Davis had been dropped from his planned appointment as a deputy director of national intelligence (DNI) came as swiftly as the news that he had been offered and accepted the job in the first place. Davis - a senior fellow at Defense Priorities and a prominent conservative commentator on the pro-restraint side of the foreign policy divide - came under attack by pro-Israel voices as soon as the news of his hiring went public, focusing on his record of criticism of Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization whose mission is meant to be combating antisemitism, warned that Davis's appointment would be \"extremely dangerous\" but pointed only to his views on Iran policy and US support for the war on Gaza - not anything antisemitic.\n\n\"Wow. So bizarre. Fighting anti-Semitism like never before but installing this guy,\" tweeted conservative commentator Mark Levin. \"Before you comment, go online and dig into his views and more. Hard to understand this pick by [DNI Tulsi] Gabbard.\"\n\nBoth shared a Jewish Insider story that broke the news about Davis's hiring, which warned of a \"growing series of appointees in key positions across a number of national security agencies who fall far outside of the mainstream on Israel and Middle East policy,\" specifically citing the think tank that Davis and several other appointees had worked for before joining the administration. That story featured a laundry list of Davis's supposedly disqualifying statements, including calling US support for the Gaza war \"a stain on our character as a nation\" and saying that the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict predated the horrific Hamas attacks of October 7 two years ago.\n\nIf the Trump administration was committed to fostering peace and pulling the United States back from onerous overseas commitments, then Davis would have been a strong pick. A twenty-one-year military veteran who served four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, Davis first rose to prominence by courageously blowing the whistle on the chasm between what Obama-era US officials were telling the public about progress in the Afghanistan war and what was actually happening on the ground, and supporting US withdrawal from the country.\n\nSince then, as a Defense Priorities fellow, Davis has repeatedly advocated for restraint-oriented foreign policy positions. While backing US military aid to Ukraine, he was also one of the first and loudest voices to prophetically argue that battlefield realities didn't favor the country and that a negotiated settlement was in its best interests, even if it meant ceding some territory. He has criticized former president Joe Biden for taking steps in the conflict that risk a direct US-Russia war and even nuclear exchange , is a critic of NATO expansion and its role in sparking the war, and has urged against offering membership in the alliance to Ukraine.\n\nOn the matter of China and Taiwan, he has argued against fighting a war over the island nation and for a policy of building up US defense to deter a future Chinese attack on US soil instead. He has been in favor of negotiations with North Korea, of pulling US troops out of Africa and Syria , and backed Trump's controversial pick of Tulsi Gabbard as DNI. He has also backed a cease-fire deal in Gaza that would end Israel's war there and foster broader peace and stability in the Middle East.\n\nAll of these are positions that Trump himself has come around to voicing at various points. And indeed, Davis himself has quite openly been a supporter of Trump. So how is it that Davis has ended up dropped from Trump's administration?\n\nThe answer is that Davis has been caught up in something of a civil war between conflicting factions of Trumpworld. As neoconservative commentator Eli Lake wrote earlier this year, there was unease among more hawkish elements of the GOP that Trump was giving entrée to \"a rising faction within the party that will weaken America's global standing\" - meaning their foreign policy arguments were alarmingly \"almost identical to the arguments that Obama made in the early 2010s for pivoting away from the Middle East and Europe toward Asia.\"\n\nJewish Insider , whose founder and publisher sits on the board of the ADL, has often been the vehicle for attacks on pro-restraint appointees like deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East Michael DiMino - the target of numerous attacks from the publication - as well as senior advisor to the secretary of defense Dan Caldwell , both of whom were Davis's colleagues at Defense Priorities.\n\nAlso in the crosshairs was Elbridge Colby, nominated to serve as the Pentagon's under secretary of defense for policy, a China hawk who has urged a more dovish line on the Ukraine war. For all of them, their positions on the Middle East - specifically, that the United States has limited interests in the region and should pull back, and that a US attack on Iran would be a bad idea - have been central to their opponents' attempts to torpedo them.\n\nWhether you agree or disagree with one or more of their foreign policy positions isn't the point. The point is that there is a genuine rift among pro-Trump figures on foreign policy, and the more hawkish side has repeatedly used their less hawkish opponents' skepticism of US policy on Israel - and now, in Davis's case, even resorting to thinly veiled accusations of antisemitism - as a way to have them blocked or fired, in the hopes of tilting the administration's foreign policy in a more pro-war direction in all theaters , not just the Middle East.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that this pressure campaign has only borne success now, with Davis's appointment. The abrupt U-turn on his hiring comes at the exact time the Trump administration is ramping up McCarthyist-style attacks on antiwar and pro-Palestine activists on the political left, most radically with its recent arrest and possible deportation of permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nYesterday marked another win for this pro-war faction: after news broke that the Trump administration was taking the unprecedented step of negotiating directly with Hamas for a five-to-ten-year-long cease-fire deal, angering Israeli officials and driving them to try and sabotage the talks, there were howls of outrage among the pro-war right. As a result, Trump moved to quell the outrage by removing his special envoy for hostage affairs, Adam Boehler , from negotiations. Among Boehler's sins, Jewish Insider pointed to public comments dismissing Israeli officials' concerns, asserting that the United States was \"not an agent of Israel,\" and that there may be more negotiations with Hamas in the future.\n\nNeoconservative critics of the \"pro-restraint\" faction of Trumpworld are clearly emboldened by his own administration's attacks on the Left to now target their ideological enemies on the right. Having finally tasted success, these efforts will likely only expand. The growing neo-McCarthyite climate in the United States, whoever its targets were at first, is a threat to everyone's rights - not just those on the left.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But since his inauguration, the federal agency that regulates banks has abandoned its support for a state law designed to reduce credit card interest rates, which now average 24 percent and cost American consumers $120 billion every year.\n\nAt issue is a 1978 Supreme Court ruling permitting banks to export their home state's light-touch lending regulations when doing business in states with stricter laws, such as interest rate caps. Since then, credit card companies and big banks have moved their headquarters to Delaware , South Dakota, and Utah - which have no state interest rate caps.\n\nBut after the Supreme Court decision, Congress carved out an option for states to set their own interest-rate caps on all banks doing business within their borders. Iowa and Puerto Rico have successfully done so, capping interest rates at 32 percent .\n\nColorado made a similar move in 2023. Fearing more states following Colorado's lead, the financial industry filed a lawsuit . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) backed Colorado, but a Trump-appointed judge initially blocked the state's new law. Upon appeal, Trump's FDIC has now withdrawn the agency's support, betraying Trump's anti-interest-rate campaign rhetoric and dealing a blow to the state's case at the Tenth Circuit Appeals Court.\n\nA new Oregon bill is following in Colorado's footsteps, where the effort may face similar industry pushback. Congress could simply resolve this states' rights issue - to the great benefit of consumers - by passing a federal limit on credit card interest rate hikes. Bipartisan legislation recently introduced in both the House and Senate would do just that, capping rates at 10 percent - and forcing Trump to decide whether to fulfill a promise he's already intent on breaking.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nLuke Goldstein is an investigative journalist based in Washington, DC.

Donald Trump has sensed this weakness and is using it to advance his own narrow interests.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 6, 2025.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLess than a fortnight after Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Vice President J. D. Vance read Europe the riot act at the Munich Security Conference in mid-February, Donald Trump followed up with a performance that would not have been out of place on an episode of The Apprentice . In front of cameras, America's president berated his counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky - who has held a deeply fractured nation together through three years of war against a more powerful adversary - for ungratefulness, reaffirming the might-is-right worldview that has been consistent throughout his presidencies.\n\nThese two episodes, which have perhaps done more than any others in recent years to disgrace the idea of statesmanship, did succeed in bringing to the fore one point: Europe's geostrategic position is dangerously precarious. For decades, the continent's leaders have fostered a relation of willing dependence on the United States, which has in exchange exercised an only limited influence over Europe's domestic and international politics. This led many to assume, wrongly, that geopolitics could not, in a post-historical world, get in the way of trade. But over the past decade, Europe's economic ties to China, which is both a market for and a source of advanced manufactured goods, and Russia, whose cheap energy aided the competitiveness of German heavy industry, have butted against America's commitment to hegemony.\n\nThe continent, despite the desires of leaders like Emmanuel Macron , has not become an independent \" third pole \" on the global stage. Instead, it is now, in its Franco-German core, increasingly reliant on America for the underwriting of its energy and defense capabilities. On the Western periphery, the UK and Ireland have been pursuing a fire sale of their assets to US private equity while also becoming heavily dependent on California's FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) for foreign direct investment (FDI). Just last year, Amazon committed to investing $10 billion over the next five years in British data centers, and Google pledged $1 billion for the same purpose.\n\nTo the east, the United States and China are battling for influence across the former Soviet states. Poland has a massive US military presence but was also an early participant in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with a large bilateral trade value of US $42 billion with China. Meanwhile, Hungary, a member of US-led NATO, has recently taken €16 billion in Chinese FDI and has integrated Chinese EV manufacturer BYD and tech giant Huawei into its economy. These split allegiances, alongside a notable downturn in economic prosperity and divergence from American growth and Chinese innovation , puts Europe at a profound disadvantage in the emerging multipolar world.\n\nThe continent's economic ties to both Russia and China make it an unreliable political partner to the United States, and its economic laggardness make it a weak one - the average growth rate within the Eurozone currently sits at an abysmal 0.9 percent, less than a third of America's. This is ultimately a product of the bloc's chronic underinvestment, caused by self-imposed fiscal constraints that even centrists figures like Mario Draghi have taken issue with. It is this state of political and economic weakness that Hegseth, Vance, and Trump have sensed and sought to capitalize on by clarifying to their European partners that in their dealings with America, they are expected to be both pliant and submissive, all the while pretending to be \"independent.\"\n\nIt is this context, defined by European economic slowdown and Russian and Chinese strength, that informs Trump's decisions, which may otherwise appear erratic. In fact, rather than being simply a chaotic outburst, the position that America's current president has taken toward Europe is an outgrowth of that developed by his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nFor example, while the Trump administration's proposed tariff and technology transfer regime is larger this time around, it betrays a preference for the Anglosphere over continental Europe. This is far from a break from the consensus view within bipartisan policy circles. Before leaving office in January, Biden made moves to broaden AI technology restrictions in the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion . The framework grants the UK and Canada preferential access to US AI technology, while seventeen EU countries (out of twenty-seven) fall into a restricted group, which includes Luxembourg, the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, and all the Baltic states.\n\nEssentially, both Biden and Trump have realized that to put distance between the United States and China, vast swathes of Europe will, effectively, have to be cut off from American technology. The Trump administration is therefore only making explicit a set of resolutions the Democratic Party elite had also come to by 2024.\n\nThe EU and Europe were in a stronger position to negotiate with American power during the first Trump term of 2017-21 than they were during Biden's tenure. Now they've lost much of their leverage. Parties committed to an independent and nonaligned Europe, mostly the radical sovereigntist left such as Jean-Luc Mélenchon and a few \" neo-Gaullist \" and centrist technocrats like Draghi and occasionally Macron, are unlikely to shape the long-term future of their respective nations.\n\nIn their place, the neoliberal European center-left and center-right are committed, albeit uneasily, to Atlanticism, even if Trump himself rejects it. Plans for bloc-wide defense spending, such as the €800 billion \"ReArm Europe\" fund proposed by Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday, will likely increase, rather than challenge, dependency on America because without reindustrialization (green or otherwise), European rearmament will simply be a further cash transfer to Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, Europe's insurgent populist right is split. Pro-American, pro-Chinese, and pro-Russian factions fill the ranks of the New Right, even within individual parties. The Polish far-right Confederation party is notoriously pro-Russian, while the right-populist Law and Justice (PiS) tends toward Atlanticism, although there are some pro-Russian PiS holdouts in the east.\n\nIn Italy, the post-fascist and right-populist ruling Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) are in their public pronouncements pro-American. Behind the scenes, however, they pursue the path of economic rapprochement with China initiated by the late Silvio Berlusconi; meanwhile, in Hungary, Viktor Orbán's Fidesz touts its relationship with Trump while strengthening defense ties with China . This European fragmentation, alongside the growth of Chinese influence across the continent, has allowed Trump to deal with Europe in a more heavy-handed way than would have been possible a decade ago. All these factions on the European right clash and collaborate, producing a foreign policy that is generally pro-rearmament but deeply skeptical of intervention in Russian and Chinese affairs.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2020, the competition between China and the United States was muted enough for Washington to maintain its transatlantic alliance system through a fiction of norms, international law, and parity of esteem between members. For instance, in 2003, when France and Germany under Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schröder, respectively, refused to back America's invasion of Iraq and threatened to veto it at the UN Security Council, very little economic leverage was used against them by President George W. Bush. A couple of decades later, the hinge point between Europe and America is now unregulated access to social media consumers in the EU, not support for wars in the Middle East. Indeed, the EU's literate, online, and educated consumer market of 450 million people, a good chunk of FAANG customers, might be the continent's only leverage against the United States' demands.\n\nEven during Trump's first term, a minimal amount of leverage was employed against Europe to ensure that NATO members met their 2 percent of GDP on defense guideline , a demand which, because of Europe's lack of a significant military-industrial complex, is effectively a call for a transfer of cash to Lockheed Martin and Boeing . The stakes are higher this time around. European states, and especially Hawkish NATO nations like Poland, Lithuania, and Estonia (who are all heavily reliant on US military bases ), are set to become the main obstacle between Trump and a promised Russia-Ukraine peace deal.\n\nLast month, Kaja Kallas , former Estonian PM and high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs, took to the world stage to proclaim that no peace deal would be struck without Ukrainian and European involvement. Indeed, the Financial Times has reported that Trump is likely to withdraw American troops from the Baltic states. Any peace deal between Ukraine and Russia is now going to sidestep the rest of Europe entirely, taking place in Saudi Arabia .\n\nWhile the United States may be relatively weaker in 2025 than it was in 2003, the gap between Europe and America has also grown. Meanwhile, China remains relatively self-sufficient and economically dynamic. Beijing is moving away from an overreliance on American consumer markets: creating resilience to tariffs and the ability to rapidly scale the value chain of manufacturing toward AI and EV production at home. BYD, the star exemplar of the latter industry, is arguably the most vertically integrated company ever.\n\nA Trump administration guided less by the idealist civilizational platitudes of a dying neoconservative movement and more by sheer self-interested pragmatism is likely to see Europe as collateral damage in the nascent cold war. While recently addressing NATO, Defense Secretary Hegseth struck a defining note for the Trump era: \"I'm here today to directly and unambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe.\"\n\nGeopolitics alone cannot, however, explain the causes of this shift. America's domestic political economy, characterized primarily by the influence of a coalition of carbon-intensive industries and tech, has been the primary motor behind Trump's move. America's domestic political economy relies on a model of economic growth that has benefitted from European subservience.\n\nTrump's victory was essentially a triumph over an alternative economic model pushed forward incoherently but purposively by the Biden administration. This model championed green growth and a massive expansion of the public sector as an alternative source of American economic development. But Biden's insistence on accommodating, rather than combating, the carbon coalition set the stage for its resurgence, which it did with a vengeance when Trump took office in January.\n\nThe Biden administration's regulation of the service and tech industry under the guidance of Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan and the more ambitious elements of the Inflation Reduction Act - a policy which intentionally threw money at Republican states in an effort to break the hold of the carbon coalition - were serious attempts to reorient American political economy. Together, they sought to weaken the influence of firms such as Amazon and Meta while using lavish tax credits to direct capital to green investment.\n\nWhile environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards held sway in large investment companies like BlackRock during the early years of Biden's presidency, it seemed as if key sections of American capital had embraced green growth. The Democrats had wind in their sails. The party's hope was, as the political economist Mark Blyth argued in a talk earlier this year , that market incentives alone could work to decarbonize America's economy.\n\nHowever, while Biden's party handed out cash to green firms, it also, through its championing of liquid natural gas (LNG) exports to Europe, empowered American carbon capital rather than rebalancing the economy away from oil and gas. By the last months of Biden's presidency, LNG exports to the continent had reached record levels , a fact that strengthened the sectors of American capital standing to gain from European energy dependence. As long as these carbon interests were balanced by countervailing green ones, nascent though they were, it was possible to imagine a world in which European autonomy was not directly a problem for America's growth model. (Some more optimistic interpreters of the moment imaged the possibility of Chimera Mark II, in which Chinese exports of green technology smoothed the way for an energy transition that took place on both sides of the Atlantic.)\n\nWhat the Democrats did not bet on was the possibility that Republicans would wage a brutal campaign of lawfare against ESG and other forms of preferential treatment for green investment. They did not, perhaps, also imagine that upon taking office Trump would seek to tear apart large sections of the Inflation Reduction Act, despite its benefits to Republican constituencies. Rather than making the risky move of attempting to become technologically competitive in a new sector, green technology, which required the United States to make the never-before-made move of reindustrializing a largely deindustrialized advanced economy, the Republicans instead chose to double down on the carbon intensive growth model that has characterized the US for a century.\n\nGrowing European energy dependency made this outcome more likely, but it was not decisive. The key factor was the failure of Biden to pass, alongside his green infrastructure programs, the more ambitious sections of Build Back Better, which would have expanded the public sector and strengthened the Democratic coalition.\n\nWith Biden defeated, tech firms like Meta could crawl out from under the thumb of the Democratic Party and use their proximity to the new administration to lobby directly for repeal of European regulation of social media firms. If they succeed, they will have effectively undermined one of the few achievements of the European center-left and -right.\n\nAmerica's arms industry will, much like its tech and energy sector, also benefit from European weakness. In 2023, 80 percent of European spending on arms went toward procurement rather than domestic production, a fact which is, as mentioned, largely beneficial to American firms. It is unlikely that plans for a new €800 billion arms fund proposed by von der Leyn this week will do much to alter this trend. This outsourcing of defense engenders a broader problem. Because of the relative weakness of European industry and the urgency of developing a viable military, Europe will, at least in the short to medium term, be unlikely to create the virtuous cycle between military spending and domestic investment characteristic of the United States during the era of military Keynesianism.\n\nThe cumulative effect of these shifts is that the relationship between Europe and the United States is likely to become even more antagonistic in the coming years. While some speculate that this opens the door to a European green growth model based around rearmament, it remains to be seen whether the political tensions within the continent - Atlanticism vs. neo-Gaullism or pro-Chinese and pro-Russian orientations - could be overcome.\n\nFor now, Europe remains a willing victim of Trump's grand strategy. Buying into naive end-of-history ideas, the continent's elites largely failed to imagine the possibility of a world in which geography, let alone geopolitics, mattered or could affect supply chains. Few seem ready to reckon with the fact that they, rather than China, are the main target for Trump and the bipartisan American political class.  Even worse, despite all the signals, Europe's political elite seem to have made little effort to hedge against a major transformation in US policy.\n\nWith America pursuing a raft of confused policies aimed at correcting its trade deficit and adopting an export model based on arms, energy, and social media, Europe - without its own military, technology, and energy industrial complexes - has deprived itself of the ability to shape its fate.\n\nSamuel McIlhagga is a British reporter and book critic covering foreign affairs, culture, and political theory.\n\nJohn-Baptiste Oduor is an editor at Jacobin.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Ads posted on Facebook , Greenland's main social network, variously suggested that two prominent politicians had either been sued by the Bank of Greenland or physically attacked, or that Elon Musk was offering payments to Greenlandic citizens. These cases were financial scams rather than politically motivated disinformation, but their emergence shows how much interest the 2025 Greenlandic election campaign attracted.\n\nMost of the international focus was devoted to the storm caused by Donald Trump's repeated insistence on acquiring the island \" one way or the other ,\" having previously declared that Greenlanders \" want to be with us .\" An opinion poll conducted in January showed 85 percent of Greenlanders did not agree, a notion that was in part reinforced by the election results. The two largest parties after the poll are unlikely to agree on international relations but have much in common when it comes to domestic issues.\n\nGaining around 30 percent of the votes in a surprise victory, the performance of the center-right Demokraatit (the Democrats) shocked even their own leader , Jens Frederik Nielsen. Demokraatit are the least eager of the five pro-independence parties that contested the election, favoring gradual progress toward an eventual referendum by adopting business-friendly policies and creating a low-tax environment. Those who opted for them did not vote to leap into Donald Trump's open arms.\n\nA little over 1,500 votes behind Demokraatit, ending on roughly 25 percent, Naleraq (Point of Orientation) is the most staunchly pro-independence of the main parties. While also ruling out becoming part of the United States, it favors closer ties with it, and its candidates are brought together more by a desire for an immediate independence referendum than by anything else. Naleraq's increased vote share may reflect discomfort with Denmark as a colonial power and desire for an independence referendum to be held, but a vote for its candidates does not necessarily indicate support for any particular approach to international relations.\n\nMirroring the trend of anti-incumbency seen in numerous elections in recent years, the parties of the current governing coalition, Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA, or Community of the People) and Siumut (Forward), saw their vote shares collapse. Both parties lost around 16 percent of the total vote compared to the last elections in 2021, with Siumut's leader resigning after the party recorded its worst result since Greenland gained home rule in 1979. Inuit Ataqatigiit's leader, Múte Egede, lost the office of prime minister on his thirty-eighth birthday.\n\nIf independence was the main motivator for this election, then both parties have suffered from hedging their bets. Inuit Ataqatigiit refused to commit to a short time frame on a referendum, while senior figures including Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam, one of Greenland's two representatives in the Folketing (Danish Parliament), left Siumut for Naleraq because of their former party's equivocation on independence.\n\nIn Greenland's electoral system, where voters cast their vote for individual politicians as well as the broader party, Høegh-Dam received more votes than her new party leader, Pele Broberg. Her strong personal brand, brought about in part by her time in the Folketing, likely contributed to Naleraq's success.\n\nHowever, independence was not the only motivating factor, and any conclusions made about it and relative support for other policies must be strongly qualified. There is scant opinion polling data in Greenland, and the electorate is tiny.\n\nOut of a total population of approximately 56,000 people, only 40,369 were eligible to vote, and only 28,620 did so . This is roughly the same as the population of William Shakespeare's birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon, or the number of people living per square kilometer in Manhattan. In Greenland, every single vote matters, and a massive defeat only requires the desertion of a couple of thousand voters.\n\nGreenland's electoral uniqueness comes not only because of its tiny population. Towns are separated from each other by huge distances. With the completion of the territory's first road between settlements still years away, domestic policy needs to cater not just to the capital, Nuuk, but to the smaller settlements.\n\nNaleraq was originally set up to do just this, with a focus on fishing and hunting rights. With the noise around independence swamping much of the international debate, parties must still continue to deliver for those outside the center. IA and Siumut seemingly failed to do this while in government, losing much of their vote share outside of the larger settlements to Naleraq in particular.\n\nRegarding the shape of the next government, the election results alone do not give too clear an indication. Greenlandic politics is reliant on the formation of coalitions, with Jens Frederik Nielsen indicating his willingness to work with any of the other parties in the aftermath of the vote. A lot remains to be decided, which will determine the next four years of Greenland's domestic and foreign policy, and which of the main elements of Demokraatit's policy platform it is able to focus on.\n\nDemokraatit, as the election winners, would need the support of either Naleraq or Inuit Ataqatigiit in a two-party coalition to nudge them over 50 percent of the vote to a majority of seats in the Inatsisartut (Greenlandic Parliament). Their leader, Jens Frederik Nielsen, has indicated his desire to form a broad coalition and unite the Inatsisartut in response to Donald Trump's continued pressure. However, any coalition would likely be shaped by Demokraatit and one of those two other parties.\n\nWorking with Naleraq would likely result in a government that supports the extraction of rare earth minerals and fossil fuels. Demokraatit's policy platform states that the last government was an \"anti-raw materials coalition. . . . They have cut themselves off from making money from oil and gas. . . . We won't get rich from that. Quite the opposite.\"\n\nThe controversial uranium mine at Kuannersuit in southern Greenland would also be up for debate once more, having been cancelled by the last government. One of the few places where Demokraatit or Naleraq failed to displace IA was Narsaq, a settlement near the mine that would be directly affected by its development and whose inhabitants clearly retain a degree of support for the party that halted the project.\n\nA Demokraatit/Naleraq coalition would also likely result in the repealing of the controversial fisheries law introduced by the last government, which, among other changes, introduced catch quotas for private companies, but not for the publicly owned Royal Greenland. The law did not receive the support of any of the opposition parties, and the chairman of the Greenlandic parliament's Fisheries, Hunting, and Agricultural Committee at the time of its passing was not reelected .\n\nA coalition featuring Demokraatit and IA would be more aligned on the question of independence, with both parties in favor of more measured progress toward separation from Denmark. However, it might have trouble reconciling IA's socialist domestic policies with Demokraatit's preference for free-market economics.\n\nDemokraatit are committed to lowering taxes, and their website includes a reference to the old idea of \"growing the pie.\" Their party program declares that they \"do not consider economic inequality to be a problem.\" Mentions of the health service in their election program focus on recruitment of staff and the notion of \"efficiency.\" However, as Greenland is, on the whole, a relatively liberal polity, even a party of the free market affirms the necessity of free health care.\n\nDemokraatit's election still represents a significant change domestically. Their policy program suggests a negative attitude toward the state, with privatization potentially high on the agenda. As Greenland moves toward independence, the party may weaken the state by selling off key industries, in the process making an independent Greenlandic government less able to resist the overtures of wealthy private companies.\n\nSuch overtures would most likely come from US firms and their ally in the White House. Billionaires including Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are investors in KoBold Metals , a mining company that began exploring Greenland for critical minerals in 2022.\n\nOn the international stage, neither coalition would respond to Trump's advances with anything other than rejection. While the importance of the election for the outside world, shown by the presence of the Danish security services in order to monitor and counteract potential foreign influence, is clear, this was not a vote where the idea of joining the United States was a realistic possibility. All parties start from the principle that Greenland decides what happens to it, something that would certainly not be guaranteed under US supervision.\n\nSeveral commentators had suggested in recent weeks that the most likely outcome of these elections would be a government that sought greater independence within the Kingdom of Denmark, gradually taking over responsibilities for different parts of the state, rather than an immediate split. This seems to have been borne out by the results, more or less describing Demokraatit's attitude for the next few years at least. The party now has a mandate, whatever coalition it ends up forming, to further reshape Greenland's relationship to its colonizer.\n\nPreelection, Naleraq leader Pele Broberg wrote for US News laying out his party's position, and said of Trump that \"no other leader in Denmark or the EU has expressed such strong support for Greenlandic independence.\" That may be the case, but it is support with strings attached.\n\nTrump's reaction to the results was to call Jens Frederik Nielsen a \"very good person\" and suggest to the NATO secretary general Mark Rutte that the military alliance should be involved in an American annexation of Greenland. Both current and future Greenlandic prime ministers predictably met this suggestion negatively , and despite Trump's efforts to call the election result \"very good for us,\" the overall picture is difficult to spin as a win for the US president.\n\nHuw Paige is a freelance journalist and writer, specializing in the polar regions.

But without challengers, the Republicans' loss of conviction in liberal internationalism will harden into a more dangerous global authoritarianism.\n\nDonald Trump delivering remarks on February 18, 2025 in Palm Beach, Florida.

Vance gave a speech to a shocked audience at the Munich Security Conference attacking liberal internationalism and defending a host of far-right parties across Europe. While his claims about the suppression of free speech across the continent, which focused almost exclusively on the far right and ignored attacks on pro-Palestine protests and left-wing parties, were cynical and disingenuous, he managed to strike a nerve.\n\nFor decades, European and American leaders have been committed to a vision of international security cooperation that has largely worked to promote the interests of the US's foreign policy establishment. Faced with the rise of China, the United States has now decided to change the rules of the game, threatening to turn its back on Europe after fostering decades of dependence.\n\nIn an interview with Jacobin , historian Daniel Bessner explains how we ought to understand this new moment in US-European relations. Should Donald Trump be seen as someone attempting to dismantle American empire, or is his turn away from liberal internationalism simply an embrace of a more authoritarian global order?\n\nThe speech that J. D. Vance gave at the Munich Security Conference last week, as well as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's comments stating that America will seek to reduce its presence in Europe, has been met with shock by liberals. Could you contextualize this reaction? What influence have American security guarantees actually had on European foreign policy in the immediate postwar era and then after the collapse of the Soviet Union?\n\nThis is obviously a good question but, forgive me, but I'm going to do what historians like to do. There's a joke that their response to any question is to say: well, it started earlier, and it was more complicated. I'd like to do that right here because I think it's important to understand the trajectory of US-European relations.\n\nWhen George Washington gave his farewell address in 1796, which, interestingly enough, was actually not an address but a printed letter, he warned against what historians have termed foreign entanglements. But what Washington was really warning about was getting politically and militarily involved in the old world. So although the US, early on in its history, had an alliance with France, noninterference in the political and military affairs of Europe was the norm until World War I, which you'll remember the United States joined as an associated power, not a formal ally, and obviously changed totally in World War II, where the United States, for a variety of complex reasons, decided to pursue a strategy of what people have now termed primacy, that is, global military and economic hegemony. Europe has been very crucial to that project of American global hegemony.\n\nAnd this created a shared sense of purpose among the European and American security establishment?\n\nYes, one can even imagine the North Atlantic world as a single polity, in the sense that it has - or imagines itself as having - a shared cultural heritage. These are, after all, the major colonial powers. They've been working against each other, but also to some degree against the Global South, for five hundred or so years.\n\nAmerican foreign policy thinkers determined in the postwar era that the United States needed control and/or influence over major industrial bases around the world. Obviously, that included those in the United States itself, but also in Central and Western Europe and Japan. This was the essential geostrategy of US hegemony, that you needed to control these industrial bases that would give you security and ensure prosperity.\n\nWorld War II was a demonstration of what happens when the US did not act as a hegemon. Obviously, there are precedents for US involvement on the continent going as far back as the 1920s. The Dawes Plan, the Young Plan, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, were all multilateral agreements set up to prevent the reemergence of war in Europe. But none of this compared to the level of US military and political involvement after World War II.\n\nSo this is a gigantic transformation in US foreign policy in the postwar era, really an epochal transformation. The United States wanted to do two things. It wanted to ensure that the Soviet Union didn't invade Western Europe because the Soviets just had many more troops on the ground, they needed to develop nuclear weapons, and they basically needed to enfold Britain, France, and what was becoming West Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, into a Western alliance.\n\nThe major countries of Western Europe, of course, have long, proud martial traditions, but it's the United States that really comes in there under the guise of NATO to quote-unquote guarantee European security. Lord Ismay, the first general secretary of NATO, famously described the organization's aims as threefold: keeping the Americans in, the Germans down, and the Soviets out, and these essentially remained its objectives throughout the duration of the Cold War.\n\nThis state of affairs has been good for Western Europe in the sense that whereas previously a lot of their economic activity had been geared toward arms races - Britain and Germany's naval arms race in the late nineteenth century up until the World War I is a prime example - Europe was able to refocus resources, particularly in France and West Germany, and also in Britain, to some degree, toward social welfare programs.\n\nWithin mainstream discussions, there are two dominant interpretations of Europe's inability to develop its own independent security infrastructure. One, advanced by realist Republicans, is that the Europeans have been taking America for a ride, subsidizing their welfare state by avoiding defense spending. And the second is that an Atlanticist wing of European states has built a coalition with the liberal wing of the State Department to actively undermine the development of an independent European defense policy so as to tie the continent to the US. What's your interpretation?\n\nYeah. I mean, I think the right-realist and the Atlanticist story are both correct. Fundamentally, the American national security state is a quote-unquote liberal project, and its pursuit of hegemony is understood in those terms. The hegemony the US has sought to pursue essentially under every president until Donald Trump has been motivated by a desire to create a more progressive world order, or a more humane world order. And the argument advanced by defenders of liberal hegemony was that World War II demonstrated that could only be done on the basis of security protection from the United States to ensure the continued existence of the global capitalist order.\n\nIf you're a Western European leader and the United States is going to guarantee your security, why wouldn't you divert resources to social welfare? And then there's also the ideological project of what you just referred to as the Atlanticist. These are people who believe, genuinely believe, that global security, a liberal global world order that is stable and prosperous depends, effectively, on US military and economic primacy. The national security state, the American empire, is a liberal empire, which is one of the reasons that Trump is so strongly opposed to it. What he is doing is returning to an almost nineteenth-century vision of great power politics. Tariffs and threats of territorial acquisition appear so strange and bothers so many liberals because they are forms of geopolitics ruled out by liberal internationalism. They are the stuff of the pre-World War II era.\n\nThis also explains why he's so hostile to multilateral relations and has bypassed negotiating with the EU in favor of speaking directly with Russia.\n\nMultilateralism is part and parcel of liberal rationalism. This is part of the twentieth-century progressive ideology about the way to end wars: bring all the states together because doing so will allow them to rationally exchange ideas and come to shared agreements. In practice, this international consensus politics morphs over the first half of the twentieth century into a form of liberal American imperialism that really gets going with Woodrow Wilson, is continued with [Franklin D. Roosevelt], and is then institutionalized by Harry Truman in the late 1940s.\n\nJust a decade ago, the line of the Obama administration, mild sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Donbas and seizure of Crimea notwithstanding, was to take a realist position on Russia. Russia has \"escalation dominance\" within Europe was the recurring phrase. What changed between 2014 and 2022 to make the Biden administration feel as confident as they have been in sending military aid to Ukraine?\n\nWhen you just look at what someone like Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was saying, or Secretary of State Antony Blinken was saying in public, they literally just say, we thought Kiev was going to be overrun within weeks. When it wasn't overrun and the Ukrainians mounted a defense, we realized that we could just give them weapons in order to bog down Russia, basically for as long as the Ukrainians are able to keep on fighting. So it's literally just using Ukraine as a chess piece in a great power politics chess game. That's literally it.\n\nHow should we understand the dismantling of USAID [the United States Agency for International Development] within this broader narrative of the Republican right's attack on liberal internationalism?\n\nUSAID is a Kennedy-era program and the way to think about it is as part of this broader project that stretched, roughly, from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. This was the great moment of institution building in American national security policy, and USAID, the Peace Corps, and the International Development Association were all part of this. They were essentially instituted by Kennedy - the Cold War liberal president par excellence - in order to undergird the security guarantees of NATO with an economic promise of development and modernization. And, of course, development and modernization become particularly crucial when it comes to the US's involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nEssentially, USAID is sort of the smiling face of American imperial dominance. And I want to emphasize this isn't to say that USAID has never done positive work. It absolutely has. But it needs to be seen as part of this larger imperial structure, because that's just what it is.\n\nWhat do you think the alternative to liberal internationalism is? Even on the Left, the dominant approach to thinking about foreign policy is to ask what the US should do about the behavior of X, Y, and Z country. The dilemma seems to me to be that either we accept a version of an American-led international order or revert to an early-twentieth-century doctrine of spheres of influence. What are the alternative ways of thinking about how states ought to relate to one another?\n\nI have a philosophical position on this issue, and people that disagree with it will likely be unconvinced by my defense of it. But I think, generally speaking, we are more likely to get a just and humane world if countries and regions are allowed to work out for themselves what type of international ordering arrangement they desire to have. This is not to say that power doesn't matter. Clearly, for example, in East Asia, China is going to be the most influential power shaping what happens in that region. But I still think philosophically, it's actually better for regional powers to shape regional orders than it is for the United States to travel thousands of miles away and try to shape the affairs of countries along American lines.\n\nThe desire to shape something thousands of miles away is doomed to fail. Geography can't be ignored. So, for example, I think the United States is eventually going to be forced to leave its hegemonic position in East Asia. Ideally, that happens peacefully and without war, but if we don't plan for it, there's a good chance that that could result in an actual war between the US and China. So the alternative to me - and I know not everyone on the Left agrees - is to oppose empire in all of its forms and to force the United States to restrain itself.\n\nThis means that America should close down the hundreds of military bases it has around the world. It needs to allow other currency regimes to emerge. It needs to stop sending weapons abroad. So my fundamental position is that regional powers, regional states, should determine their future, that the United States can't do it, and, moreover, that you are simply never going to get the good parts of the empire without the bad parts of the empire. They go together.\n\nSo for those two reasons, I think the left-wing anti-imperialist position should demand that, over time, the United States draws down its empire. Now, it shouldn't do that willy-nilly. It shouldn't do that out of nowhere. The United States has made obligations to people. It has funded, for example, Western Europe's defense for a long time. Various countries in East Asia, you could say the same thing. So there should be a managed transition. But we need to focus on that transitional moment away from imperial domination. And we almost never do.\n\nDaniel Bessner is an associate professor in International Studies at the University of Washington.

These moves have already torn apart communities and rallied far-right extremists.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents walk down a street during a targeted enforcement operation in Chicago, Illinois, on Sunday, January 26, 2025.

It's a repurposed version of the CBP One app, which the Biden administration had used to process asylum claims from people waiting at the US-Mexico border.\n\nAccording to DHS, the old app will automatically update to the new version, which it noted is \"also available free across mobile application stores.\" It's part of a $200 million ad campaign announced in February, telling migrants they will be \"hunted down and deported\" unless they \"leave now,\" which DHS says may give them \"an opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American Dream.\"\n\nFor now, it is unclear how these reports will be used, or how the Trump administration plans to convince people to use the app, as voluntary departures are not otherwise recorded by migration authorities. It is also unclear how authorities plan to use the information. But Bindhu Vijayan, the executive director of Beyond Legal Aid, which operates on a community-activism-lawyering model, described the app as misleading.\n\nVijayan told Jacobin :\n\nIf someone has already decided to leave, regardless of the consequences, they will proceed accordingly. However, for those who are under the impression that this is a viable pathway for return, they are being misled - manipulated through partial truths and a lack of full disclosure. This is not just misinformation; it's a calculated strategy that plays on fear and uncertainty, layering coercion upon coercion. The rhetoric surrounding this issue feeds into that fearmongering, reinforcing a narrative designed to control.\n\nThe term \"self-deportation\" may take many readers back to the 2012 presidential primary, when Republican candidate Mitt Romney said that instead of mass deportations, he'd influence migrants to leave the US voluntarily, by cutting them out of the labor market with programs such as E-Verify. It seemed almost like a joke - but even back then, the American Immigration Council wrote that what Romney was really pushing for was \"a plan pursued by extremist immigration-control organizations in Congress and state houses across the nation,\" which it identified as \"attrition through enforcement.\"\n\nAt that time, the strategy already included state-level attempts to deny \"education, transportation, and even basic services like water and housing to anyone who cannot prove legal immigration status.\" After Romney lost to Barack Obama that November, a pre-White House Donald Trump called the Republican's strategy \"maniacal\" and told Newsmax it had cost him the Latino vote: \"He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.\"\n\nGiven that on the campaign trail last year, Trump promised an immigration enforcement strategy similar to \"Operation Wetback,\" the 1950s campaign that deported about a million Mexicans and some Mexican Americans from the United States, the administration's recent focus on self-deportation may seem like a pivot. But it's actually part of a long tradition of anti-immigrant policy in the US and around the globe.\n\nWhen immigration authorities arrived in Chicago a week after Trump's inauguration to start carrying out a blitz on undocumented communities, TV personality Dr Phil joined them in the field. He even live streamed the operation on his social platform, alongside border czar Tom Homan, who has threatened to deport US citizen children alongside their undocumented families to avoid family separations.\n\nThe bizarre media spectacle has since been followed up with other surreal developments. On Valentine's Day, the White House posted a card on social media that read: \"Roses are red, Violets are blue, come here illegally and we'll deport you.\" It was followed up a few days later with an \"ASMR\" video of migrants being shackled and loaded onto a deportation flight. Authorities have also announced plans to create a registry of undocumented individuals ages fourteen and up.\n\nMeanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested high-profile Palestinian student activist Mahmoud Khalil, who is a green card holder. The measures are seemingly designed to terrorize migrant communities and leave them vulnerable, all amid reports that immigration authorities are actually not delivering the number of deportations Trump had hoped for, at the pace he expected.\n\nIn a 2019 article in the Harvard Law Review titled \"Self-Deportation Nation, \" University of California, Los Angeles Law's K-Sue Park argued that the logic of self-deportation - which she defines as the strategy of \"making life so unbearable\" that those groups who are \"unwanted as members of the American polity\" decide to leave - forces individuals to choose between \"voluntary departure\" or submitting \"to the vulnerability imposed on them.\" She sees self-deportation campaigns as a driver of the \"expansion of the grounds of deportability far beyond the possibility of actual enforcement. The widespread threats these developments create function to subordinate a population on which the nation relies heavily for labor.\" She explains that, instead, \"the policy works in the service of outcomes other than removal alone . . . subordination in the service of labor control.\"\n\nPark sees precedents for what she has termed the logic of self-deportation policies in various episodes throughout US history: the arrival of the first colonizers; laws written to force indigenous peoples from their lands; state-level efforts to marginalize newly freed black people; the Chinese Exclusion era; and the Mexican Repatriation movement of the 1930s.\n\nThe current White House policy of strongly encouraging self-deportation functions partly by encouraging xenophobia. The Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees all people in the United States equal protection under its laws, doesn't provide protection against discrimination by private individuals. As Park explains, this allows the state not only to collaborate with municipalities, states, corporations, and more to \"expand the capacity of the deportation system,\" but to \"[delegate] discrimination to private entities, who are best positioned to perform it because they interact with people in the register that the policy attacks - their everyday lives.\"\n\nThere's evidence of a link between a state's anti-migrant rhetoric and the incidence of hate crimes and violence against migrants. One October 2024 study found that incidences of violence against migrants and LGBTQ communities increase as a result of online hate speech, with triggers including Trump's 2016 campaign. Since the election in November, for example, a chapter of the white-supremacist hate group the Ku Klux Klan has passed out flyers in neighborhoods in Kentucky , Ohio , Tennessee , Indiana , and other states, calling not just for migrants to leave immediately - but for their neighbors to help identify and report them, as well as join the Klan's ranks. In the months before the election, false claims about Haitian migrants in Columbus, Ohio, by Trump, his vice-presidential candidate J. D. Vance, and others resulted in bomb threats and harassment, while in New York City, a parks worker was charged with a hate crime after he shot dead a thirty-year-old Venezuelan migrant.\n\nNonstate actors have, throughout the United States' history, often been the foot soldiers of government discrimination campaigns. During the Great Depression, the \"voluntary\" repatriations of Mexicans were just one example. The federal government carried out few direct deportations. But anywhere from 300,000 to 2 million Mexicans and Mexican Americans are estimated to have left the US in that period. They left under pressure from local authorities who denied them access to lifesaving Depression relief or out of fear of forced deportation or harassment from their neighbors.\n\nHistorian Emiliano Aguilar of the University of Notre Dame has done extensive research on the repatriation movement. He sees in that episode many parallels with our current political moment. \"The Mexican community was placed between two difficult decisions,\" Aguilar told Jacobin . They could return to Mexico, or \"they could remain, bereft of employment or any forms of community support, whether through community relief efforts or institutional support.\"\n\n\"Today the Trump administration has crafted their own lose-lose solution for the undocumented community in the United States,\" Aguilar explains. \"Unfortunately, this will also entail varying levels of legislation meant to deprive undocumented communities of municipal services. . . . Just like the repatriation movement, the claim of voluntariness at play today is rhetoric to dispel the very real restrictionist, xenophobic, and inhumane actions under the guise of fixing a long unstable immigration policy. The GOP's strategy: rhetoric over actual reform.\"\n\nThe fear being drummed up by the administration's immigration strategy is seeing results, as undocumented migrants work to avoid a surprise deportation that would upend their lives.\n\nDaniela, who is currently thirty-three, is undocumented, even though she has been in the United States since she was two years old. But stuck at the crossroads of a broken system and the new pressures of the second Trump era, she's now planning to move from the Southwest United States to Mexico, along with her US citizen husband - who she says has been steadfast in his support of her - and their four US-born daughters, though the girls speak no Spanish. The family even hopes to move to a community in Mexico that's mostly populated by US Americans, as they all grew up in the United States. \"I've gone to the Mexican consulates to get my passport, and that's terrifying enough, because their Spanish is so different from mine; I've lost so much because I've lived in the US my whole life. It's weird - I feel like I'm going to be a foreigner in the country of my birth,\" she tells Jacobin .\n\n\"It's a little terrifying. I feel like I need somebody to hold my hand when I get there, to tell me where to go. What do I do? How do I get a job? How do I get a license?\"\n\n\"We had dabbled with the idea of moving to Mexico if we got to the point where there was no solution,\" Daniela says. But the Trump administration's rhetoric toward migrants has affected her. \"It definitely has brought a lot of that fear to the forefront of my mind, when I'm driving or out and about, of being extra vigilant of who's around and not calling attention to myself or doing something that might cause someone to ask, 'Hey, let me see your ID.'\"\n\n\"The overall sense of the country is hyper-vigilance. There was a fire marshal parked down the street, but he was in an all blacked-out truck, sitting there for a few hours facing toward our home. I just got really nervous. So my husband went and asked, can I help you with something?\"\n\nEven though Daniela's father is a US citizen, she says because he never financially supported her as a child, she was unable to adjust her status on the basis of his parentage, though the family did a DNA test to confirm for authorities that she's his daughter. Since marrying her husband, the couple have been working for ten years to adjust her status. Unlike some other childhood arrivals, Daniela did not apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, on the advice of a legal professional, who she says believed it was safer for her to pursue other options - advice subsequent legal counsel told her was a mistake.\n\n\"But we've stalled out on that because I have an illegal entry,\" Daniela says, explaining that her US citizen father paid a coyote to bring her and her mother into the country. As a result, if Daniela and her family leave for Mexico, she likely won't be able to attempt to reenter the country until the end of a ten-year bar.\n\n\"My entry was illegal, at the age of two. That's my biggest complaint about the immigration system. There's no age of consent or liability.\" In order to attempt to get her green card, Daniela would have to go to Mexico for an interview. \"There are hundreds and hundreds of people who go. . . . They leave their families, and then they never get to come back.\"\n\n\"That's the biggest reason we're self-deporting. I have the control,\" Daniela explains, in the hopes her husband will never have to explain to their daughters, \"Well, mom's gone, she's in Mexico.\"\n\nNyki Duda is a freelance writer and editor whose work has appeared in Truthout , Dissent , In These Times , and more.

(Lori Van Buren / Albany Times Union via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn a memo that that one TSA employee said sounded like \"a teenage blogger writing about someone they don't like,\" the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced March 7 that it was canceling the union contract for 47,000 workers at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) signed its contract with TSA in May 2024, and it wasn't set to expire until 2031.\n\nDHS also stopped deducting union dues and ordered all union officers to immediately return to their transportation security officer (TSO) duties. Workers voted in the union in 2011.\n\n\"To have this thing that you fought for . . . wiped away at the speed of an email, without any notice, was devastating,\" said Joe Shuker, who hired in twenty years ago and worked to build the union. \"But look,\" he said, \"we've been here before.\"\n\nSuddenly without a union, \"the creep and the rot is coming back quickly,\" said Lowell Denny, a TSO in Austin, Texas. By Saturday morning, management was already telling TSOs not to call in sick, he said.\n\n\"They're back to the old tone: 'We're watching you,'\" said Denny, who has worked for TSA for twenty years at five different airports. He recalled how, before workers had a contract with seniority rules, agency managers would \"give their favorites prime schedules.\"\n\n\"In San Diego, the assistant federal security director was laughing to the employees and kind of taunting them, like, 'Hey, you don't have a union anymore,'\" said Bobby Orozco, president of the Southern California local. \"As of Friday, there's absolutely no grievance procedure.\"\n\nManagement instantly ended a widely used system for trading shifts that is laid out in the contract and enables TSOs to make time for important life events. \"I'm puzzled why TSA has suspended that; I don't see the harm,\" said Denny.\n\n\"I was on the bargaining team that got shift trading,\" said Shuker, who was president of the Philadelphia local for fifteen years. \"It was big to be able to give somebody your shift.\" He said it helped people avoid taking sick leave - and the reduction in absences benefited managers too.\n\nAt many airports, previously scheduled bidding for shifts for the busy summer season has been canceled. Workers guessed this meant the seniority system dictated by the contract was being dismantled.\n\nOrdinarily the union, AFGE TSA Council 100, would appeal the decision to the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the agency that certified the union in 2011. But the Trump administration illegally fired the authority's chair on February 11, and the two remaining members cannot conduct business because they lack a quorum.\n\n\"Everything that is being done today was all planned and premeditated,\" said Gilbert Galam, secretary of AFGE Local 1230 and a TSO in Sacramento, California. \"The opposition very much did their homework when they decided they were going to union bust.\"\n\nRight after taking office, Trump fired TSA's director, David Pekoske, whom he had appointed in 2017. Pekoske was in the middle of his second five-year term leading TSA.\n\nThe administration memo claimed the union had to be eliminated because it was hamstringing personnel decisions. And it ridiculously claimed that \"TSA has more people doing full-time union work than we have performing screening functions at 86 percent of our airports\" (italics in original).\n\nIn reality, the union had 168 full time and twenty-five part-time union representatives on \"official time,\" serving 46,600 bargaining unit members, said Orozco. In Philadelphia, there were four union reps out of eight hundred TSOs, said Shuker.\n\nIf sick leave abuse happened, Denny said, \"then management did have a right to impose leave restriction and progressive discipline. But all that's gone.\"\n\nIf anything, workers said, dumb new demands have been an obstacle to getting work done.\n\n\"You know, so you're looking for bombs. And now you're worried about, 'Oh, let me get the five things to [Elon] Musk that I did,'\" said Shuker. \"They had to drag people off the floor to do that.\"\n\nBut it's even more disruptive and distracting to abrogate the contract, Denny said: \"There are no more rules about anything.\"\n\nWorkers said managers regularly pull TSOs off the floor to do clerical tasks and to assist managers with email, amounting to many more worker-hours than are spent on union tasks.\n\nIt was the union that brought stability to the workforce, Shuker said, through better work rules and by pushing Congress to include TSOs on the same pay schedule as other federal workers. Before a recent pay raise, TSA turnover was 20 to 25 percent a year, the highest in the federal government.\n\nJust in Philadelphia, they lost 200 officers a year, Shuker said: \"People were leaving TSA to go work at the Chick-fil-A in the airport, because the pay was better and the hours were better.\"\n\nThe result was a lot of mandatory overtime for those who remained. Attrition was expensive too. Training a new officer costs $40,000, Shuker estimated.\n\nThe 2023 pay increase amounted to 30 percent for some workers. Now TSO starting pay in Philadelphia, with a locality differential, is $48,348 a year. In a cheaper area like Rapid City, South Dakota, it's $45,659.\n\nBut pay was not the only thing that reduced turnover. \"People not only felt like they were getting paid, but also that they were . . . accumulating rights\" since unionizing in 2011, Orozco said. \"There was a light at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\n\"The fact that they're telling folks that they took the union away, that's a constitutional right that they're taking away from people,\" he said. \"This is more than just our agency and our workers. These are constitutional violations that are happening.\"\n\nWorkers have been sharing screenshots of the pages from Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership detailing a plan to privatize the service. \"We know what their intent is, because the blueprint was already written in Project 2025 and is there for all to see,\" said Orozco. \"And now we're seeing it being manifested.\"\n\nAirport security was all private before the September 11, 2001, attacks. Several workers told me they thought that patchwork for-profit system allowed the 9/11 attacks to happen.\n\n\"That's why we needed a national system that's not looking to make a profit,\" Orozco said. \"Our message to the American people is that we're not here to make a profit. We're here to make sure that you're safe and you get home safe and your family gets home safe.\"\n\nTSA was created under the DHS in 2001 to overhaul airline security. The workforce accounts for about a quarter of DHS workers.\n\nOriginally the workers had no union rights, and they were excluded from Title 5 of the US Code, which covers other federal workers. But many wanted to organize. AFGE helped the workers develop a plan: even with no rights, they would act like a union. Workers paid dues and helped coworkers defend themselves from unfair discipline and discrimination, using the small leeway provided by management directives.\n\nThey objected to ridiculous work rules, like one dictating that you couldn't take sick leave adjacent to a day off. But some workers faced discipline because their regular schedule was two ten-hour days followed by a day off. Any sick day they might try to take was by definition next to a day off.\n\nThey even had to fight for free parking, at a time when starting pay was around $12 an hour and urban airport parking could run $30 a day.\n\nBy the time they won the right to a union election, AFGE had chapters at thirty-eight airports. The workers won their election, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority certified the union in 2011. But it wasn't until 2021 that the Biden administration included TSOs under Title 5, leading to a big pay bump that reduced attrition.\n\nOrozco's advice to fellow TSOs? \"Don't panic,\" he said, recalling their decade-long effort to unionize. \"We'll do it again like we did last time, and sooner.\"\n\nHe said the union is working with other airport and aviation unions -flight attendants, pilots, and airport workers in the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) - to form a united front.\n\n\"I'm kind of excited to meet the challenge,\" said Galam. \"But it feels like the odds are stacked against us at the same time.\"\n\nHe and other TSOs said they've been quickly signing up members for electronic dues, and even though the union is no longer recognized, people are eager to sign up. \"We've been having a lot of people asking how they can be involved,\" he said.\n\nDuring the previous Trump administration, TSOs were required to work without pay for more than a month during a government shutdown in January 2019, the result of a fight in Congress over funding a border wall.\n\nAfter weeks of no paycheck, TSO sick calls soared. Some workers didn't have gas or childcare money; others may have been objecting to being forced to work for free. Airport terminals in Miami and Houston had to shut down. Flights started to back up.\n\nThe shutdown ended when the \"blue flu\" spread to air traffic controllers, further snarling airports. Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), called for a general strike, arguing that flight attendants and passengers were being made unsafe by the stress inflicted on TSOs and air traffic controllers.\n\nOn Friday, Nelson said the administration's current move is \"terrible for aviation security and everyone who depends on safe travel . . . [and] an egregious attack on workers' rights that puts us all at risk.\"\n\nJenny Brown is an assistant editor at Labor Notes . She is author of Birth Strike: The Hidden Fight Over Women's Work .

Donald Trump's tariffs have disproved this received wisdom.\n\nPresident Donald Trump waves as he makes his way to board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on March 7, 2025.

After an intense stand-off with Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, and Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, Trump backed down from his plans, claiming victory after both nations agreed to concessions on border policy and drug trafficking coordination in exchange for a one-month pause.\n\nThen on March 4, Trump made a series of erratic moves. First, he imposed 25 percent tariffs on most imported goods from Mexico and Canada, carving out a special exemption for energy. Two days later, he partially suspended these tariffs by broadening the exemption to include goods that fall under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) free-trade deal he had negotiated with Mexico and Canada during his first term. This decision was promptly followed up by a plan, scheduled to take effect on March 12, to slap a 25 percent levy on steel and aluminum on all importers except Canada, for which he reserved a 50 percent tariff.\n\nOther than countering drug trafficking and migration, one of the main justifications given by the White House is the United States' trade deficit in goods, which in 2023 reached over $1 trillion. It is unclear whether Trump's plans will succeed in achieving any of their stated aims, but they have already forced politicians within North America to radically rethink their assumptions about the geopolitics of the hemisphere.\n\nAmerica's attacks on its northern neighbor have come as a particular surprise to observers. Canada has long been one of the US's most loyal allies, and this dependency on America for trade as well as security would, many thought, preclude the possibility of confrontation. But in reality, it has been these close ties which have provided the United States under the Trump administration with leverage to deal with its own internal social crisis by lashing out.\n\nThe US is one of the world's richest economies, yet it also runs one of the largest trade deficits - a characteristic that it shares with the British Empire during its declining years. The persistent US trade deficit is tied to two key developments in the post-WWII order. First, in its effort to consolidate capitalism on a global scale, the United States absorbed surplus production from Western Europe and Japan, helping to stabilize their economies while reinforcing its own economic and political hegemony.\n\nSecond, to secure the dominance of the dollar as the world's primary reserve currency, the US had to function as the global consumer of last resort - continuously importing goods and allowing dollars to circulate worldwide, thereby ensuring their availability for international trade. This structural role made trade deficits an integral part of American imperialism rather than a problem to be solved by protectionist measures like tariffs.\n\nThis historical context highlights the paradox at the heart of Trump's tariff strategy: while the US trade deficit has long been a structural feature of its global dominance, Trump portrayed it not only as an economic weakness that needed urgent correction, but also as a burden the nation has shouldered for the benefit of global economic stability. Consequently, for the Trump administration, tariffs are a means of rectifying this imbalance to prioritize domestic prosperity.\n\nMAGA was the rallying cry for a turn away from global economic dominance. On the campaign trail, Trump positioned tariffs as a central tool for addressing the trade deficit. His professed goal was to reduce this trade deficit, drive reindustrialization, and create jobs by shifting the economic burden from American taxpayers to foreign countries and generating, in his words, \"massive revenue\" for the US government.\n\nHowever, Trump's ideas, despite their narrative coherence, relied on an oversimplification of the economics of tariffs that flew in the face of historical evidence that undermines the idea that tariffs are effective in reducing trade imbalances or generating significant economic benefits. A cursory look at trade between the United States and its key trading partners - Canada, Mexico, and China - reveals the limitations of this approach. In 2024, American imports from these countries totaled around $1.5 trillion, while US exports were approximately $1 trillion. If the United States were to impose a 25 percent tariff on all imported goods from these nations, and these countries retaliated with similar tariffs, the US would generate roughly $175 billion in tariff revenue.\n\nWhile this represents a fiscal gain, it amounts to just 3.5 percent of total US government revenue and would do nothing to address the structural causes of the US trade deficit. Moreover, Trump's strategy includes pressuring these countries not to retaliate, threatening even higher tariffs if they do. All this will mean in practice is a \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" trade policy whose greatest achievement will be to export American unemployment to Canada, Mexico, and China.\n\nIt is true that a tariff war would disproportionately hurt smaller economies like Canada heavily dependent on trade for their production and consumption requirements. Yet Trump's economic advisory team seems to ignore that a tariff war hurts all the participant countries, regardless of their economic and military strength. If the United States persists with its policy of high tariffs on its neighboring and other countries, the increased value of the dollar, combined with tariff-induced cost increases, could make American goods less competitive in international markets.\n\nCountries looking to maintain their competitiveness may devalue their currencies, further eroding the price competitiveness of US exports. Ironically, instead of boosting US export revenues, an aggressive tariff policy could have the opposite effect - leading to a reduction in export earnings and potentially harming the very industries it aims to protect.\n\nImposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as facing retaliatory tariffs from these trading partners, would significantly increase the cost of intermediate goods used in US manufacturing. Since many American firms rely on foreign-sourced inputs, higher import costs would translate into higher production costs for goods manufactured domestically.\n\nGiven the highly interconnected nature of supply chains, these increased costs would be passed along the production network, leading to higher consumer prices for industrial goods. The automotive industry, for example, is highly integrated across North America, and tariffs on intermediate goods would drive up the cost of automobiles in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. These price increases would have direct consequences for workers, as firms in these sectors may respond by cutting labor costs through layoffs, wage suppression, or automation. Additionally, as inflation erodes purchasing power, the real wages of workers decline, meaning that even if nominal wages remain unchanged, the higher cost of goods and services will result in lower standards of living for workers.\n\nIt is possible that the Trump administration believes that tariffs are capable of addressing America's trade deficit by attracting increased capital inflows. However, this is complicated by two factors. First, Trump's restrictive immigration policies, including large-scale deportations and tighter migration controls, could hinder the demographic growth needed for sustained economic expansion and foreign investment. Skilled workers and talent from emerging economies may choose other destinations, weakening the US labor market and its attractiveness to foreign capital. Second, tariffs disrupt global trade flows, which could reduce both imports and exports, making the US less appealing to foreign investors and diminishing capital inflows.\n\nThus, in a highly integrated global market, relying on tariffs to curb imports, stimulate reindustrialization, and boost US production and exports as a means to reduce the trade deficit is ultimately self-defeating. Such an approach would slow down production and employment growth not only in trade partners but also within the United States. Moreover, the expectation that capital inflows would help offset the trade deficit, an assumption central to the Trump administration's strategy, would become increasingly unrealistic under these conditions.\n\nThe economic strength of the United States has long been characterized by its ability to exert pressure on even its closest allies, particularly those with structural dependencies on it, either in the form of market access or military security. The sheer size of the US economy allows it to dictate economic terms to its North American partners, Canada and Mexico, whose economies are deeply intertwined with the United States.\n\nAccording to the White House Fact Sheet , trade accounts for 73 percent of Canada's GDP and 67 percent of Mexico's GDP, with the majority of their exports and imports directed toward or coming from the US. In contrast, international trade comprises only 24 percent of the US GDP, and while Canada and Mexico are key trading partners, their leverage over the United States remains limited. This structural asymmetry enables the US to impose economic directives on these nations with little fear of meaningful economic retaliation.\n\nMany policymakers, politicians, and scholars argue that Canada should respond to US tariffs by imposing equivalent retaliatory tariffs and diversifying its trade relationships to reduce its dependence on the United States. While theoretically, both ideas have some merits, they are motivated more by a romantic spirit than the facts on the ground.\n\nIf Canada were to impose equivalent tariffs on US imports, the overall economic impact on the United States would be marginal. Given the size of the US economy, the share of international trade in its total GDP, and the fact that Canadian imports make up only 13 percent of total US imports, such countermeasures would not inflict substantial economic damage on the United States.\n\nIn contrast, Canada's dependency on the US means that the economic fallout from a US tariff increase would be far more severe. According to the Bank of Canada , a 25 percent tariff imposed by the United States on Canadian goods would lead to a 2.5 percentage point contraction in Canada's GDP in the first year, followed by a 1.5 percentage point contraction in the second year. While Canada might eventually regain economic growth, the overall level of output would be permanently lower due to long-term distortions in investment and production patterns.\n\nThe economic dislocation caused by a US-Canada trade conflict would also have severe labor-market implications for Canada. The export sector plays a crucial role in maintaining the aggregate level of employment in the Canadian economy, supporting over 3.6 million jobs in 2022. Of these, 2.4 million jobs are directly linked to exports to the United States.\n\nThe disruption of trade flows due to tariffs would inevitably result in job losses, particularly in export-dependent industries such as manufacturing, automotive production, and natural resource extraction. Additionally, the backward linkages of these sectors - such as in transportation, logistics, and business services - would further amplify the employment crisis. In the short term, these job losses would place downward pressure on wages and consumer spending, exacerbating the economic downturn.\n\nBeyond its impact on production and employment, a trade war with the United States would have immediate and tangible effects on Canadian consumers. The composition of Canada's Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket reveals that 13 percent of household expenditures go to American imported goods. This means that an average Canadian consumer relies on US imports for a significant portion of their monthly purchases.\n\nRetaliatory tariffs would raise the prices of these goods and increase the cost of living. Essentials such as fresh fruits, vegetables, juices, meat, and so on, many of which are imported from the United States, would become more expensive, as would household appliances, clothing, footwear, furniture, and recreational goods such as sports equipment. The inflationary impact of countertariffs would disproportionately burden lower- and middle-income households.\n\nTo offset the competitive disadvantage imposed by US tariffs, Canada would likely pursue currency devaluation as a policy response, allowing the Canadian dollar to weaken against the US dollar. A devalued Canadian dollar would make Canadian exports more competitive in the US market, partially mitigating the impact of tariffs.\n\nHowever, this strategy comes with significant trade-offs. A weaker Canadian dollar would simultaneously make US imports more expensive for Canadian consumers, intensifying inflationary pressures. Additionally, devaluation could lead to capital outflows and higher borrowing costs.\n\nThus, this partial equilibrium approach to imposing retaliatory tariffs overlooks the structural economic constraints that limit Canada's ability to effectively counter US economic coercion. In the short run, it is quite possible that these tariffs could be rolled back by the US, as they were in February, creating the mistaken impression that Canada's countertariffs were effective.\n\nRegardless of how long Trump persists with his trade war, the tariffs he has imposed serve as an important warning for Canada to reconsider its economic dependence on the United States, for this may not be the last time it is subjected to America's economic statecraft. In fact, given the possibilities of a further deepening of the crisis of American imperialism, economic coercion of Canada could become even more brutal as time goes on. Canada's response must go beyond symbolic retaliation and focus on long-term strategies that would have the potential to enhance the economic resilience of its economy.\n\nCanada has long assumed that deep economic integration with American imperialism would serve its best interests. However, Trump's trade policies have exposed the fragility of this assumption, revealing the limits of a strategy premised on alignment with US imperial objectives, and more important, this issue extends beyond tariffs. The United States has long leveraged its economic dominance over Canada to extract \"voluntary\" concessions on issues of critical natural resources access, immigration, border security, and military spending - demonstrating a broader pattern in its foreign policy.\n\nIf Canada really wants to consolidate its economic autonomy and sovereignty, delinking from American imperialism is no longer just an option but a necessity. However, this shift should not be framed as a retreat into nationalist economic sovereignty. Instead, as Sam Gindin argues , it requires a democratically driven restructuring process that prioritizes collective economic control.\n\nThis necessitates a critical reassessment of the foundations of Canadian economic and foreign policy: Should Canada continue embracing neoliberalism? Should it maintain its heavy reliance on international trade that is, by default, centered on the United States? Must it remain a junior partner in American imperial politics, including NATO commitments and broader imperial ambitions?\n\nThese questions require serious consideration, as Canada's chosen path will shape not only its economic future but also its broader social trajectory.\n\nParamjit Singh is associated with the Global Labour Research Centre and the York Centre for Asian Research at York University, Toronto, and assistant professor in the Department of Economics at Panjab University, India.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nA month before Election Day, I posted this on Facebook:\n\nAs the last week's events around the failure of the Republicans and Donald Trump to shape Congress's most recent spending bill reveal, I got this prediction pretty much right.\n\nI should confess right off the bat that I do get a fair number of predictions wrong. Most painful, I was sure Clinton would win in 2016, a prediction that my critics, understandably, have never let me or my readers forget.\n\nBut one thing I did get completely right about Trump's first term, before it even began, was that he would be a spectacularly weak president; failure, rather than success, would be his lot. The reason for that failure and that weakness, I argued again and again, had little to do with Trump's personal fecklessness or incorrigible incompetence, considerable as they were and are. It had much more to do with the dysfunction internal to the Republican Party and the conservative movement.\n\nI continued to make that argument throughout Trump's first term and was frequently criticized for it. Which has made it all the more surprising, these past few months, to see people claim that the new Trump, the Trump who ran and won in 2024, has learned the painful lessons of his first term, when key underlings opposed him and even more key Republicans departed him. Last I had checked, hardly anyone was willing to acknowledge that the story of his first term was not Prometheus Unbound but a lot of sound and fury, signifying, well, you now how that goes.\n\nRegardless, as this Facebook post from October suggests, I've not been convinced that Trump 2.0 would necessarily be all that different from Trump 1.0. Nothing having to do with Trump personally; I've always thought the focus on his personal flaws and hapless leadership has distracted us from the deeper rot within the Republican Party and the conservative movement.\n\nWell, with the last week's events, the media has finally realized the truth: the dysfunction continues. The problem, for Trump, remains what it has always been: not the so-called moderates in his party but the hard right . The media, which, before and after the election, was anticipating a new conservative colossus, seems, at least for the moment, to have had some clarity put into its perspective .\n\nAll those claims about a Republican Party now and newly beholden to Trump, terrified to cross him (or, I guess, Elon Musk, who's now deemed to be the true Mephistopheles of the moment)? This is what the New York Times had to say about that on Thursday:\n\nJust two days ago, President-elect Trump and Elon Musk threatened to ensure a primary challenge for any House Republican who voted for a bill that didn't include a debt limit increase. Tonight, 170 of them did just that.\n\nAgain, none of this is new. As I've argued repeatedly, whenever the GOP has wanted to cross Trump, they have.\n\nThere are many reasons for this, but a key source is a combination of changes in party structure, campaign financing, and American business. As Paul Heideman shows in an eye-opening book that will be coming out (I think) next year with Verso, these hardcore right-wingers who tanked Trump's plans for raising the debt limit are not just ideological purists and fanatics; the GOP has had those forever. The problem is that they've got independent sources of funding and huge levels of support in their districts. As one of them told the Times , \"I love Donald Trump, but he didn't vote me into office; my district did.\" These representatives reflect a dramatic shift, which Heideman traces back to the 1980s and 1990s, in the way power in the party works and how politicians get funding, and business has reverted to its historical mode of being politically powerful but internally disorganized - and thus unable to impose any discipline on the party from the outside, as it was once was able to.\n\nThat doesn't make for power or coherence in the party, but just the opposite. Just as we saw powerlessness and incoherence in Trump's first term, we're seeing it now, even before his second term has begun. As I've been arguing since the election, the idea that any of this is going to get any easier come January is foolish. The GOP is going to have the tiniest majority in the House - smaller than the majority it will have in the Senate, which has hardly ever happened to a political party in recent American history - and that is going to put it, and Trump, in an even weaker position than he and it were when Trump and the party were voted into power in 2016.\n\nCorey Robin is the author of The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump and a contributing editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Trump's \"DEI Purges\"? Yeah, It's Just Racist Bigotry.\n\nMother Jones illustration; Eugene Hoshiko/AP; Wikipedia\n\nI want to make space for the idea that some people had well-intentioned gripes against DEI.\n\nMany were told that diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts had gone too far, and some people believed that President Donald Trump was simply making a good-faith effort to rein it in, to curtail the abuses of \"woke\" gone unchecked.\n\nI think those people are very wrong, but it's okay-we'll agree to disagree.\n\nBut what has become abundantly clear in the first 60 days of Trump's presidency is that reining in alleged preferential treatment or leftist overreaches were never Trump's goal. Something much more sinister is at play.\n\nHow do I know? Well, allow me to introduce you to some American heroes: Dr. Robert Henry Lawrence Jr ., the first Black man accepted into the United States space program; First Lieutenant Anita Morris, the National Guard's first Black female chaplain; and Maj. General Marcelite J. Harris, the first Black woman to achieve the rank of major general in US history. All of these American heroes have two things in common. First, they made outstanding contributions to their communities and their country.\n\nSecond? You can no longer find their photos on certain US military websites.\n\nIn the latest installment of a series in which I read and respond to racist comments, I highlight the erasure of these American heroes as part of Trump's anti-DEI crusade.\n\nAs reported by the Associated Press , some 26,000 images featuring people and events considered \"DEI content\" were flagged for removal from Department of Defense websites as part of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's promise that DEI would be \"dead\" under his leadership.\n\nWhat's clear is that Trump's anti-DEI movement is plainly bigoted. The administration's actions demonstrate an intent to erase Black people and other groups from the American story, and I believe it is up to us to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "As Powerful Law Firms Roll Over for Trump, One Lawyer Has Had Enough\n\nAP Photo/Ben Curtis\n\nOn the heels of Donald Trump's executive order targeting several top law firms over ties to the president's perceived enemies and decisions he opposes, Trump on Thursday announced that he had reached an agreement to drop his attack against one of the firms, Paul, Weiss. The deal, according to a Truth Social post, will renege Trump's threat to suspend the security clearances of the firm's attorneys in exchange for Paul, Weiss to dedicate $40 million in pro-bono services throughout his term.\n\nThe deal was widely seen as a remarkable act of capitulation by one of the most powerful law firms in the country. And now, an associate at Skadden Arps, another top firm, is speaking out.\n\nIn a company-wide email that was publicized online, Rachel Cohen, a third-year finance associate, condemned her employers for failing to speak out against the Trump administration's retaliatory efforts. Cohen said that her letter should be considered a resignation unless any meaningful action emerged.\n\n\"This is not what I saw for my career or for my evening, but Paul Weiss' decision to cave to the Trump administration on DEI, representation, and staffing has forced my hand,\" she wrote. \"We do not have time. It is either now or never, and if it's never, I will not continue to work here.\"\n\nThough she appears to be the most outspoken, Cohen is not alone in her anguish. Earlier this week, more than 300 attorneys joined Cohen's open letter to so-called Big Law firms that encouraged their employers to defend the profession against the Trump administration's attacks.\n\n\"We call on our employers, large American law firms, to defend their colleagues and the legal profession by condemning this rapid purge of 'partisan actors,' a group that seems to be synonymous with those the president feels have wronged him,\" the letter states.\n\nTrump's executive order is one part of a long revenge campaign against people who've gotten on the president's bad side. As our staff recently reported:\n\nThe last 10 years Donald Trump spent running for president had an organizing principle: They ruined America, and we have to take it back. The \"theys\" were a varied group: immigrants, whistleblowers, trans people, journalists, Democrats, civil servants, independent-minded Republicans. But Trump's option for dealing with resistance was the same: unsparing retribution, often trampling the norms of a legal and political system attempting to thwart his antidemocratic power grabs.\n\nAs of this morning, Cohen does not appear to have access to her corporate email account.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Tragedy-and Tyranny-of Donald Trump's War on \"Woke\"\n\nMother Jones illustration; Paul Sancya/AP\n\nThis story was originally published b y Grist a nd is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration .\n\nIn his first hours back in the White House in January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled \" Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship .\" Yet it was immediately clear he was in fact imposing rules on language, ordering the government to recognize only two genders and shut down any diversity, equity, and inclusion programs . In one executive order, he redefined \"energy\" to exclude solar and wind power .\n\nWithin days, not just \"diversity\" but also \"clean energy\" and \"climate change\" began vanishing from federal websites. Other institutions and organizations started scrubbing their websites. Scientists who receive federal funding were told to end any activities that contradicted Trump's executive orders. Government employees-at least the ones who hadn't been fired -began finding ways to take their climate work underground, worried that even acknowledging the existence of global warming could put their jobs at risk.\n\nThe Trump administration's crackdown on words tied to progressive causes reflects the rise of what's been called the \"woke right,\" a reactionary movement with its own language rules in opposition to \"woke\" terms that have become more prevalent in recent years. Since Trump took office, federal agencies have deleted climate change information from more than 200 government websites , according to the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, a network that tracks these changes. These shifts in language lay the groundwork for how people understand what's real and true, widening the deepening divide between how Republicans and Democrats understand the world.\n\n\"If we only are dealing with the information that we're receiving via social media, we're literally operating in different realities.\"\n\n\"I think that all powerful individuals and all powerful entities are in some sense trying to bend reality to favor them, to play for their own interests,\" said Norma Mendoza-Denton, an anthropology professor at the University of California-Los Angeles, who coedited a book about Trump's use of language . \"So it's not unique, but definitely the scope at which it's happening, the way it's happening, the speed of it right now is unprecedented.\"\n\nGretchen Gehrke, who monitors federal websites for the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, says that government sites are one of the few sources the public trusts for authoritative, reliable information, which is why removing facts about climate change from them is such a problem.\n\n\"It really does alter our ability as a collective society to be able to identify and discuss reality,\" Gehrke said. \"If we only are dealing with the information that we're receiving via social media, we're literally operating in different realities.\"\n\nInstitutions that fail to follow Trump's executive orders have already faced consequences. After Trump rechristened the Gulf of Mexico \"the Gulf of America,\" for instance, The Associated Press stood by the original, centuries-old name in its coverage-and its reporters lost access to the White House as a result. The effects of these language mandates have reverberated across society, with university researchers, nonprofits, and business executives searching for MAGA-friendly phrases to stay out of the administration's crosshairs. The solar industry is no longer talking about climate change, for instance, but \"American energy dominance ,\" echoing Trump's platform.\n\nThe new language rules are expected to limit what many scientists are permitted to research. \"It's going to make it really hard to do the climate justice work,\" said Amanda Fencl, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists, referring to the field that studies how a warming planet affects people unequally.\n\nThe National Science Foundation, which accounts for about a quarter of federal support to universities , has been flagging studies that might violate Trump's executive orders on gender and diversity initiatives based on a search for words such as \"female,\" \"institutional,\" \"biases,\" \"marginalized,\" and \"trauma.\" \"I do think that deleting information and repressing and silencing scientists, it just has a chilling effect,\" Fencl said. \"It's really demoralizing.\"\n\nDuring Trump's first term, references to climate change disappeared from federal environmental websites, with the use of the term declining by roughly 38 percent between 2016 and 2020, only to reappear under the Biden administration. Trump's second term appears to be taking a much more aggressive stance on wiping out words used by left-leaning organizations, scientists, and the broader public, likely with more to come. Last summer, a leaked video from Project 2025 -a policy agenda organized by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank-revealed a former Trump official declaring that political appointees would have to \"eradicate climate change references from absolutely everywhere.\"\n\nSome government employees are finding ways to continue their climate work, despite the hostile atmosphere. The Atlantic reported in February that one team of federal workers at an unnamed agency had sealed itself off in a technology-free room to conduct meetings related to climate change, with employees using encrypted Signal messages instead of email. \"All I have ever wanted to do was help the American people become more resilient to climate change,\" an anonymous source at the agency reportedly said. \"Now I am being treated like a criminal.\"\n\nThe last time Trump was in office, federal employees replaced many references to \"climate change\" with softer phrases like \"sustainability\" and \"resilience.\" Now many of those vague, previously safe terms are disappearing from websites too, leaving fewer and fewer options for raising concerns about the environment. \"You really cannot address a problem that you can't identify,\" Gehrke said. A study in the journal Ecological Economics in 2022 examined euphemisms for climate change used under the previous Trump administration and argued that the avoidance of clear language could undermine efforts to raise awareness for taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nYet using more palatable synonyms could also be viewed as a way for scientists and government employees to continue doing important work. For example, when the Federal Emergency Management Agency rebranded its \" Climate Resilience\" site to \"Future Conditions\" in January, it stripped references to climate change from its main landing page while leaving them in subpages. \"To me, that reads as trying to fly under the radar,\" Gehrke said.\n\nOf course, the reality of the changing climate won't disappear, even if the phrase itself goes into hiding. Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, who last year signed a bill deleting most mentions of climate change from Florida state law , is still dealing with the consequences of a warming planet, continuing to approve funding for coastal communities to adapt to flooding and protect themselves against hurricanes. He just calls it \" strengthening and fortifying Florida \" without any mention of climate change.\n\n\"You can ban a word if you want,\" Mendoza-Denton said, \"but the concept still needs to be talked about.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump Just Signed an Order Gutting Seven More Federal Agencies\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the Justice Department on Friday. Pool/AP\n\nIn an executive order signed late Friday, Donald Trump effectively dismantled seven more federal agencies, this time with cuts that will impact work on homelessness, libraries, support for minority-owned businesses, and the US Agency for Global Media, which funds Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. The cuts are expected to leave thousands more federal workers unemployed; in the case of VOA, it furthers a specific vendetta Trump has had since his first term.\n\nThe order will affect the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the United States Agency for Global Media, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, and the Minority Business Development Agency. It instructs the head of each agency to submit a report to the Office of Management and Budget \"explaining which components or functions of the governmental entity, if any, are statutorily required and to what extent.\" In practice, as has happened with other federal agencies in recent weeks, it's expected to leave these agencies a shell of themselves and fundamentally nonexistent; in the case of the US Interagency Council on Homelessness, it destroys the only federal agency solely focused on addressing the homelessness crisis.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump called VOA's reporting \"disgraceful.\" This time around, he placed Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier Kari Lake as a \"special advisor\" to the agency.\n\nThe move against the US Agency for Global Media has attracted the most attention, and could have the largest implications abroad. VOA specifically has been active since the 1940s, where it broadcast stories into Germany that were meant to counter Nazi propaganda. During his first term, Trump called VOA's reporting \"disgraceful .\" This time around, he placed Trump loyalist and 2020 election denier Kari Lake as a \"special advisor\" to the agency. In December, he wrote that she would \"ensure that the American values of Freedom and Liberty are broadcast around the World FAIRLY and ACCURATELY, unlike the lies spread by the Fake News Media.\"\n\nLake made it immediately clear that she wouldn't respect VOA's editorial independence, telling a crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference, \"VOA has been telling America's story to the world for 83 years this Monday.

      "text": "Trump's New Executive Order Just Dealt Another Brutal Blow to the Department of Education\n\nProtesters hold signs during a March 13 rally in front of the Department of Education in Washington, DC, to protest budget cuts. Gent Shkullaku/Zuma\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken the first step to officially abolish the Department of Education, a $268 billion government agency responsible for the administration of federal funding programs for schools and enforcement of civil rights law that his administration has already gutted.\n\nIn an executive order signed Thursday, Trump directed the newly confirmed Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to \"facilitate the closure\" of the agency to the \"maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\" During her confirmation hearing , McMahon acknowledged that only Congress had the power to eliminate the department it created in 1979, but she evaded questions by Democratic senators when they asked whether she supported Trump's proposal to eliminate the department. The Secretary of Education can reduce the agency's power through staff reductions-which she already has-and budget cuts.\n\n\"Today we take a very historic action that is 45 years in the making,\" Trump said before signing the order at the White House, flanked by children sitting at school desks. The agency's \"useful functions\" will be \"fully preserved,\" Trump claimed, insisting that statute-required programs like Pell Grants and enforcement of disability rights laws will move seamlessly elsewhere.\n\n\"We're going to shut it down,\" Trump continued, \"and we're going to shut it down as quickly as possible.\"\n\nTrump was expected to sign the order two weeks ago before backing down. Since then, McMahon cut the department's staff of more than 4,100 employees nearly in half through voluntary buyouts and a sweeping reduction in force. Education advocates have warned that shrinking the agency-already one of the smallest cabinet-level agencies in the federal government-will jeopardize its ability to serve the country's most vulnerable students, particularly disabled students.\n\n\"This executive order is nothing more than an illegal overreach of executive power designed to unemploy dedicated civil servants and decimate the critical services they provide to millions of Americans across this country,\" Sheria Smith, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, a union representing thousands of education department employees, said in a statement. \"It also cannot be understated that it seems this administration is hell-bent on eliminating the much-needed accountability and oversight the Department of Education provides.\"\n\nWithin hours of her confirmation on March 3, McMahon sent agency employees a memo titled \"Our Department's Final Mission.\" In it, she commended Trump's sweeping actions, including his slate of executive orders that promote school choice programs , seek to root out so-called \"gender ideology\" and end \"radical indoctrination\" of children through diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, while also banning trans girls and women from women's sports.\n\n\"The Department of Education's role in this new era of accountability is to restore the rightful role of state oversight in education and to end the overreach from Washington,\" McMahon wrote. \"This restoration will profoundly impact staff, budgets, and agency operations here at the Department.\"\n\nMcMahon also celebrated Trump's goal of \"eliminating waste, red tape, and harmful programs.\" Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team has canceled more than $1.6 billion in department contracts and $1.1 billion in grants, although by DOGE's own calculations, the actual savings are less than 60 percent of that. Among the canceled grants was $600 million to place teachers in underserved schools, a decision that a federal judge blocked on Tuesday, saying it would have a \"grave effect on the public.\"\n\n\"It's just moving the country in such a wrong direction,\" Robert Kim, executive director of the Education Law Center, told me, noting that Congress created the department in 1979 out of a recognition that students-and schools-needed an agency focused solely on education. \"For this White House and this federal government to want to strip all of that away and return to this fragmented, unfocused way of addressing education would just take us back to those generations where education was deprioritized and really only a privilege for a subset of our children.\"\n\n\"This administration is hell-bent on eliminating the much-needed accountability and oversight the Department of Education provides.\"\n\nThe bulk of money for schools does not come from the federal government-federal dollars account for about 14% of public K-12 schools' funding. But the Department of Education disburses vital funding for schools serving low-income students in poor communities through Title I and offers school support for disabled students through Individuals with Disabilities Education Act grants. At the college level, it administers the Pell Grants for low-income students, a program that is expected to face a $2.7 billion budget shortfall by the end of the fiscal year. Add to this the federal student loan program for which the agency holds $1.6 trillion in loans from 43 million borrowers.\n\nMost Education Department responsibilities are codified by law and cannot be eliminated without Congressional approval, Kim says. Title I, Pell Grants, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and important anti-discrimination laws, including Title IX and Title VI protecting against sex and racial discrimination, respectively, would not die alongside the department. At her confirmation hearing, McMahon suggested that other federal agencies are equipped to enforce those laws-the Department of Justice could handle discrimination complaints, she said, and the Department of Health and Human Services, run by Robert F. Kennedy Jr ., could oversee funding and protections for students with disabilities.\n\nBut properly administering those programs and laws means far more than just disbursing money, Kim says. The department funds and releases important research that guides policy implementation and best practices. It also has established relationships with thousands of school districts and colleges across the United States.\n\nReallocating Education Department responsibilities would require students and their families to go to multiple agencies to enforce their rights-not only making the civil rights landscape more complex for families but also burdening other government agencies that often lack the expertise to manage these responsibilities. The Education Department's Office of Civil Rights, for example, handles tens of thousands of civil rights complaints each year.\n\n\"It's fanciful at best to think that civil rights function would be carried out with the same degree of fidelity that is currently happening,\" Kim says.\n\nEven without abolishing the department entirely, the significant staff reductions could heavily impair the agency's ability to investigate civil rights complaints. On March 14, parents and the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates , a national disability rights group, sued the Department of Education to reverse the reduction in force that is slated to take effect on Friday. The department closed 7 of its 12 civil rights offices and slashed its civil rights workforce in half. \"Secretary McMahon knowingly decimated OCR's staffing to a point where the caseload exceeds any approximation of reasonableness,\" the complaint reads. \"The gutting of OCR's staff means that no complainant has a fair shot at accessing an OCR investigation.\"\n\nAs ProPublica reports , since Trump took office the department has halted most investigations into race and gender discrimination while it's opened an array of investigations into schools, colleges, and athletic programs with trans-inclusive sports policies. It issued a press release applauding Wisconsin's and New Hampshire's interscholastic athletic associations for changing their policies to comply with Trump's trans sports ban executive order. A bill to codify Trump's declaration that trans-inclusive sports policies from kindergarten through college amount to sex discrimination couldn't break through the Senate filibuster earlier this month.\n\nThe agency has launched investigations into dozens of universities that participate in an initiative to enroll minority students in doctoral programs, arguing the effort amounts to racial discrimination. The department sent letters to 60 colleges whose students held pro-Palestine protests, warning of potential Title VI investigations for failing to address anti-semitism on their campuses.\n\n\"Donald Trump and Elon Musk have aimed their wrecking ball at public schools and the futures of the 50 million students in rural, suburban, and urban communities across America.\"\n\nIn furthering the pervasive governmental attack on DEI programs generally, the agency launched an \" End DEI Portal ,\" allowing allowing parents, teachers, students, and the \"broader community\" to bypass the typical complaint process to report \"divisive ideologies and indoctrination.\" As my colleague Julianne McShane reported , the right-wing parental rights group Moms For Liberty featured prominently in the announcement of the portal, although neither the department nor the group would say what role Moms For Liberty had in the portal's creation.\n\nTrump promised Moms for Liberty at its 2023 summit that he would give education \"back to the states.\" Ahead of the executive order's signing, Moms for Liberty co-founder Tiffany Justice celebrated it, posting on social media on Thursday that dismantling the agency would allow parents and states to \"take the reins\" over education. The Department of Education doesn't dictate curriculum, and states and school districts have wide latitude to set policies. \"Abolishing it isn't chaos,\" Justice wrote , \"it's freedom to fix what's broken.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump and Elon Musk have aimed their wrecking ball at public schools and the futures of the 50 million students in rural, suburban, and urban communities across America, by dismantling public education to pay for tax handouts for billionaires,\" Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, said in a statement. \"In moving forward with this, Trump is ignoring what parents and educators know is right for our students.\"\n\nOn March 5, the National Education Association, representing 3 million teachers and professors across the United States, joined the American Civil Liberties Union in suing the Department of Education over its February memo to schools and colleges ordering them to halt diversity initiatives. Kim says the Education Law Center, meanwhile, is \"exploring all avenues,\" including potential litigation, to prevent the dismantling of the agency. \"Only Congress has the power to affect the future of a federal agency such as the US Department of Education,\" Kim says. \"Executive branch actions that that bypass the role of the legislative branch would be unconstitutional.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump and Musk Are Running a Disinformation Campaign on Social Security\n\nProtesters outside a Tesla showroom in New York City on March 1 Gabriele Holtermann/Sipa via AP\n\nDonald Trump keeps saying he has no intention of slashing Social Security, but...he and his mini-me, Elon Musk, won't stop making outlandish claims about the program and appear to be setting the table for cuts that they will try to call something other than \"cuts.\"\n\nJust about every time they mention the program and entitlement spending, they lie. Musk recently denigrated Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme.\" It isn't, but if it were, shouldn't you whack away at it? And during an interview with Fox Business, he claimed there's $500 to $700 billion in annual waste and fraud within entitlement spending-when there is no evidence of that ( as Forbes notes ). Moreover, he and Trump have falsely insisted there are a gazillion dead people on the rolls, implying checks are going out to ghosts.\n\nIf things go to hell at the SSA, older voters might get truly get pissed.\n\nThis duo of deceit is doing all they can to raise doubts about the most popular and arguably the most important government program. Meanwhile, Musk and his dodgy DOGErs have moved to shitcan or force out thousands of employees at the Social Security Administration, perhaps as many as 10,000 . (Good luck reaching someone there on the phone.) The downsizing that has already occurred at the agency has led to \"a significant loss of expertise,\" according to one former employee. If things go to hell at the SSA, older voters might get truly get pissed.\n\nUnlike ideologues of the right who have long salivated at the thought of shrinking entitlements and privatizing Social Security, Trump realizes such a move could be political suicide. So he has repeatedly vowed not to reduce the program. But should his promise be believed? (That's a rhetorical question.) After Musk uttered an inartful statement this week about eliminating purported waste and fraud within entitlement programs-which some people interpreted as an expression of his desire to kill these programs-the White House rushed out a press release declaring, \"The Trump Administration will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid benefits. President Trump himself has said it ( over and over and over again).\" But here's the tell that the White House cannot be trusted on this front: The statement was full of lies about entitlement spending.\n\nThe press release claimed Musk was correct to opine that waste and fraud in entitlement programs totaled up to $700 billion each year. To back this up, the White House listed four \"facts\" and provided citations. Nerd that I am, I clicked on the links and discovered-wait for it-these citations did not support what the Trump White House was asserting. Let's run through them:\n\nFACT: The US Government Accountability Office estimates taxpayers lose as much as $521 billion annually to fraud-and most of that is within entitlement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThat is not what the GAO said. Its report stated, \"The federal government could lose between $233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.\" That is, could . Not that it does. And this estimate of possible fraud included Covid pandemic-fraud, which likely boosted the number. As for the claim that most of this comes from entitlement program, the citation supplied by the White House links to a GAO report that says there was an estimated $236 billion in \"improper payments\" in 2023. But it adds, \"Such payments are essentially payment errors that can be the result of many things-including overpayments, inaccurate recordkeeping, or even fraud.\" Medicare and Medicaid did have the most payment errors-$186 billion-but, again, that's not necessarily due to fraud.\n\nFACT: Over the past two decades, the federal government has made an estimated $2.7 trillion in \"improper payments\"-the majority of which come in the form of \"payments to deceased individuals or those who no longer [are] eligible for government programs.\"\n\nThis is highly misleading. The GAO report cited says that most of the improper payments were overpayments. As an example of an overpayment, it pointed to \"payments to deceased individuals or those no longer eligible for government programs.\" It did not say that payments to dead people or ineligible recipients comprise the majority of these improper payments-only that they account for some of these errant payments.\n\nFACT: The Social Security Administration made an estimated $72 billion in improper payments between 2015 and 2022.\n\nThis \"fact\" left out important context. The inspector general of the SSA, who came up with this statistic, noted that the $72 billion was \"less than 1 percent of the total benefits paid during that period.\" While $72 billion seems like a lot of money, a 1 percent error rate is rather admirable for an immense and complex program. Plus, the IG said that some of these payments were deemed improper because of errors made by beneficiaries in reporting changes in their circumstances. These might not be instances of fraud.\n\nFACT: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimated it made $140+ billion in improper payments in 2024 alone.\n\nThe White House is mugging the truth to foster the impression that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are ridden with fraud.\n\nThis was quite the whopper. Click on that link and you get a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fact sheet on improper payments. Add up the figures, and the total is $86 billion, not $140-plus billion. More important, the CMS states, \"It is important to keep in mind that not all improper payments represent fraud or abuse. Improper payments are payments that do not meet CMS program requirements. They can be overpayments, underpayments, or payments where insufficient information was provided to determine whether a payment was proper. Most improper payments involve a state, contractor, or provider missing an administrative step.\" It added, \"Of the 2024 Medicaid improper payments, 79.11% were the result of insufficient documentation.\" In other words, these payments might have nothing to do with waste and fraud.\n\nYou can see what's going on here. The White House is mugging the truth to foster the impression that Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are ridden with fraud. No doubt, within enormous programs that disburse a combined total of about $2.8 trillion a year, there will be waste, abuse, and fraud. That needs to be addressed, and the feds routinely spend a lot of resources each year trying to do so (without having to be besieged by the minions of DOGE). In its fact sheet, CMS reported that the improper payment rate had dropped for several of its major programs.\n\nBy and large, the stats ain't so bad. Yet Trump and Musk are running a disinformation campaign that targets Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, inaccurately depicting them as rotting with criminality. Why do that? What are they setting up? It's not too hard to imagine.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Absurdity of Trump's Autopen Meltdown\n\nPresident Joe Biden signs a document with his very own hands. Oliver Contreras/White House/Zuma\n\nPresident Donald Trump has a new hobbyhorse: That his predecessor, President Joe Biden, didn't legally grant pardons to people Trump wants to harass because the pardons were signed with an autopen, a device for replicating a signature, rather than by hand.\n\nTrump has identified some signature requirement as the one rule presidents must obey.\n\n\"The 'Pardons' that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,\" he ranted on Truth Social just after midnight on Monday. \"In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!\"\n\nThis argument is hilarious.\n\nTrump and his MAGA allies have embraced a lawless approach to the presidency. Trump's executive orders, actions, and legal filings all point to an understanding of the president as far more powerful than previously understood, with king-like powers over the entire executive branch. The president, they argue, is unbound by rules over firing officials or the civil service, by criminal laws, by the legal interpretations of other agencies (including the Justice Department), by Congress' power of the purse, and it would seem-in multiple cases-unbound by court orders. But in Trump's midnight rage-posting, he has identified some signature requirement as the one rule presidents must abide by.\n\nThe logic is absurd. Last summer, the Supreme Court granted presidents immunity from criminal prosecution for acts within their core powers, including the pardon power. Now, a president can literally trade a pardon for a bribe. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in her dissent, \"Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune.\" According to Trump's new rubric, she omitted the golden rule that the pardon had to be signed by hand. Then, feel free to bribe away.\n\nAccording to Trump, he can appoint the world's richest man to dismantle federal agencies, halt payments, cancel contracts, and enrich himself-all outside the purview of Congress. It's an extraordinary assertion of executive branch power-the power to delegate, in effect, all the executive's power, and then Congress' to boot. But what he cannot delegate is the signing of his signature to an autopen?\n\nUsually the Trump administration is all about automation. They are reportedly using artificial intelligence to scan the social media posts of visa-holders and flag for deportation anyone it judges has made pro-Hamas or pro-terrorist comments. This dragnet is certain to ensnare people who merely criticized Israel's tactics against Gaza or the United States' support of that war-and that indeed may be the entire point. In other words, they are outsourcing a crackdown on free speech to AI.\n\nIt's not the administration's only use of AI. According to multiple reports , AI is being deployed across the federal government to reduce the workforce and transform federal agencies into an AI-run bureaucracy. So not only has Trump outsourced his job to Musk, but Musk is now outsourcing his-and most other federal employees'-to a chatbot. Whether a job exists or a deportation is ordered or your data remains private will now depend on an algorithm and the few DOGE employees who utilize it.\n\nBut outsource to an autopen? That's a bridge too far.\n\nTrump, of course, isn't preoccupied just with the autopen but with what he claims it means: That Biden was too senile to govern, and the automatic signature is proof that someone else was calling the shots. It is obviously proof of no such thing. Conversely, signing by hand is no indication that Trump has read all of the dozens of executive orders he has issued since January 20. (We've all claimed to have read the fine print, haven't we?) But Trump, in his zeal to delegate vast authority to Musk and AI, obviously is authorizing things he doesn't know about or cannot foresee-like the time his administration fired the team working to stop a bird flu pandemic and then scrambled to hire them all back.\n\nUsually the Trump administration is all about automation. But outsource to an autopen? That's too far.\n\nThere are practical concerns with the no-autopen rule. What if a president is away from his desk when a pardon must be issued in order to avert, say, a wrongful execution? What if he injures his hands and cannot sign? Does he lose the pardon power? The pardon power has been set out by the Supreme Court as one of the president's \"core powers\" that cannot be proscribed-yet somehow, according to Trump's logic, this power can be entirely undone by use of an autopen?\n\nTo Trump's credit, it doesn't appear that he came up with this legal strategy. Instead, it seems to have emerged from the Heritage Foundation in an attempt to poke legal holes in Biden's executive actions. Trump, according to remarks on Sunday, is so desirous to prosecute people Biden pardoned in the waning days of his administration-like former Rep. Liz Cheney, who co-led the January 6 Committee-that he intends to ask the courts to throw out Biden's pardons on the strength of his autopen argument. \"It's not my decision; that'll be up to a court,\" he said. \"But I would say that they're null and void.\"\n\nPerhaps Trump is imagining that Chief Justice John Roberts, the author of the decision granting presidential immunity, will finally draw a line on executive authority. Do what you want, Roberts might decree, but you have to sign the document by hand.\n\nEven for this Supreme Court, that level of absurdity is certainly too much.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump Does Not Have a \"Mandate\" for Any of This\n\nSamuel Corum/Pool/CNP/Zuma\n\nIn the 1932 presidential election, Franklin Delano Roosevelt wiped the floor with his Republican rival, Herbert Hoover. He won the Electoral College 472-59, and bested the incumbent with 57 percent of the popular vote. It was a decisive rout at a time of crises-a devastating depression, soaring inequality, rising fascism in Europe-and FDR embraced it, launching his New Deal. \"We do not distrust the future of essential democracy,\" he declared in his inaugural address. \"The people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who is doing his best to undo what remains of FDR's legacy, made similar claims in January-and in his address to Congress on Tuesday-of his own, narrow, victory, itself a response to crises ranging from real (inflation, war) to entirely fabricated (an immigrant crime wave, the Big Steal). \"My recent election,\" Trump remarked during his inaugural address, \"is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom.\"\n\nHe was hardly the only one invoking the m-word. \"Trump is back with a big agenda, a mandate-and an axe to grind,\" noted a Politico headline. Management and Budget officials justified their freeze on federal grants and loans based on \"the will of the American people,\" who had given Trump a \"mandate to increase the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar.\" Elon Musk, who has glommed onto Trump like a ravenous limpet, told White House reporters that \"you couldn't ask for a stronger mandate\" to eviscerate the administrative state: \"The people voted for major government reform, and that's what people are going to get.\"\n\nDid they really ? In his speech on Tuesday, Trump claimed-absurdly-that the November election \"was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades.\" In fact, Trump won less than half of the popular vote-which, given the turnout, amounts to less than one-third of registered voters. His margin of victory was the tightest since 2000, the fourth tightest since 1940. Subsequent polling showed solid majorities opposing his tariff plans, birthright citizenship ban, withdrawal from the Paris climate deal, January 6 pardons, and the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. (People hated that.) Even Trump's own supporters deemed it unacceptable for him to impose loyalty tests on federal workers (58 percent) or to pardon friends or supporters convicted of crimes (57 percent). And this polling came before Trump unleashed Musk and his post-pubescent underlings on federal agencies like a swarm of diseased locusts.\n\n\"In the US, usually claiming a mandate is done when a victory has been particularly large,\" Terry Royed, a political scientist at the University of Alabama and co-editor of the 2019 book, Party Mandates and Democracy , told me via email. \"Trump's popular vote margin was not large.\" And when you consider his Electoral College margin and House and Senate swings, \"Trump didn't do super-well there, either,\" she added.\n\nFDR claimed mandates, too. But unlike Trump, he was reelected by a wide margin and his policies were very popular.\n\nLyndon Johnson in 1964 . Richard Nixon in 1972 . Ronald Reagan in 1984 . Those were big, decisive victories. But mandates ? Marquette University political scientist Julia Azari, who scrutinized more than 1,500 presidential communications for her 2014 book, Delivering the People's Message: The Changing Politics of the Presidential Mandate , questions the entire premise. Take 1964, she says: \"Some people were voting affirmatively for LBJ's agenda, but what really fractured the Republican coalition and led to that landslide was the fear of [Barry] Goldwater and the unpopularity of the things he was saying. And even there, there's a lot to choose from.\"\n\nAzari views mandates as merely a \"construction\"-an idea that has been used by monarchs, dictators, and (small d) democrats alike to justify their power since at least as far back as imperial China, when dynastic kings asserted a \" mandate of Heaven \"-a divine right to rule.\n\nThe Western notion of a mandat -as a command or judicial order- came about amid 16th century upheaval in Europe, as Reformation figures began challenging the hegemony of the Catholic Church. Before then, \"authority and inequality were linked; men of wealth and noble birth were also in charge of exercising the functions of government. The vast bulk of the population was politically irrelevant,\" the late German-American sociologist Reinhard Bendix-who was expelled from secondary school in 1933 for refusing to give the Nazi salute-wrote in his 1978 book, Kings or People . \"After 1500, the rigid bond between authority and inequality loosened.\"\n\nThe first American president to use the mandate concept as a power flex, Azari says, was Andrew Jackson, a Trump favorite. Elected in 1832, Jackson set out to destroy the nation's fledgling central bank , she wrote, \"rationalizing his actions by claiming the president enjoys a special popular endorsement.\" Eighty years later came President Woodrow Wilson, whose racist segregation of the federal workforce is echoed in Trump's DEI purges-and who, in 1908, wrote of a victorious presidential contender, \"Let him once win the admiration and confidence of the country, and no other single force can withstand him, no combination of forces will easily overpower him.\"\n\nPresidents of both parties, including Bill Clinton and Joe Biden , have since touted their electoral results to advance their agendas. But Trump and his minions have taken the claim to outlandish extremes, as if winning an election can empower a president to defy democratic norms, federal law, and the Constitution itself. As if the people had elected a king. (Trump has even hinted of his own mandate from Heaven, declaring, of his fortuitous turn away from the assassin's bullet, \"I was saved by God to make America great again.\")\n\nMandates are typically invoked, Azari has observed, when a president is on the defensive or when he seeks to vastly expand his powers. Both apply to Trump-whose approval ratings in reputable polls have never exceeded 49 percent-but also, interestingly, to FDR, who, frustrated by a conservative Supreme Court striking down some of his New Deal policies, declared his 1936 re-election results a mandate \"to save the Constitution from the Court and the Court from itself.\" The following year, he backed a bill, which failed, that would have let him add six new justices to the court. (Trump's toadies are calling for the impeachment of judges who rule against his executive actions.)\n\nSome within Trump's brain trust are openly supportive of his authoritarian ambitions, viewing the dismantling of government as a counterrevolution against an antidemocratic bureaucracy. \"We are living under FDR's personal monarchy 80 years later-without FDR,\" the billionaire tech investor Marc Andreessen said on a podcast in December.\n\nAndreessen was paraphrasing his \"good friend\" Curtis Yarvin , a self-styled political philosopher of the tech right who has lamented America's \"kinglessness.\" Now, he added, \"you need another FDR-like figure but in reverse...somebody who is actually willing to come in and take the thing by the throat.\"\n\nBut voters, for the most part, did not sign on to wipe out FDR's accomplishments-or Johnson's for that matter. Indeed, unlike Trump, FDR was reelected with an impressive majority. He won 60 percent of the vote, and took every state except Maine and Vermont. Mandates may not be real, Azari emphasizes, but margins matter. \"There was a lot of popular support for the New Deal,\" she told me. \"There's not necessarily a lot of popular support for undercutting the New Deal, undercutting the Great Society, and doing so in a way that has no procedural legitimacy.\"\n\nWill of the people? Hardly. Trump eked out a comeback win and kept himself out of prison-no more, no less.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Vladimir Putin's Investment in Donald Trump Pays Off Bigly\n\nMother Jones; Gavriil Grigorov/AFP/Getty\n\nThe below article first appeared in David Corn's newsletter, Our Land . The newsletter comes out twice a week (most of the time) and provides behind-the-scenes stories and articles about politics, media, and culture. Subscribing costs just $5 a month-but you can sign up for a free 30-day trial .\n\nTalk about a good ROI. Vladimir Putin's investment in Donald Trump is sure paying off.\n\nIn recent days, Trump has promoted Moscow's horrendously false talking points, excoriating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \"dictator\" and blaming Ukraine for the brutal war that Putin, a real dictator, launched. He also kicked off talks with Russia to end the war and left out Ukraine. It's hard to imagine a better scenario for Putin. And at the United Nations, the Trump administration proposed a resolution on the war that declined to hold Russia responsible for the conflict. (It was amended to include language blaming Moscow and then passed, with Washington abstaining.)\n\nPlus, the chaos caused by Trump and Elon Musk's blitzkrieg against US government agencies could well redound to the Kremlin's advantage. With national security agencies-the CIA, the FBI, and others-and the Pentagon under siege due to this assault, their capabilities to defend the nation from threats posed by Russia or other adversaries will be diminished. All the Trump/Musk-generated conflict is in sync with Putin's long-standing aim to sow discord in the United States.\n\nWhat a good deal for Putin: Trump siding with him on Ukraine, legitimizing his tyrannical reign, and breaking with Western allies.\n\nMoreover, on her first day in office, Attorney General Pam Bondi disbanded the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force, which sought to counter secret operations waged by Russia, China, and other foes to affect US elections. She also cut back enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a tool used by the feds to neutralize malign influence and disinformation operations. And now the FBI is being run by Kash Patel, a MAGA provocateur who has hailed the January 6 rioters and who has echoed Putin's phony claim that Moscow did not clandestinely intervene in the 2016 campaign and assist Trump.\n\nWhat a good deal for Putin: Trump siding with him on Ukraine, legitimizing his tyrannical reign, and breaking with Western allies. The US government and national security community in turmoil. Washington undermining its standing throughout the world and diminishing its global influence. And a US administration opening the door for more Russian covert attacks and holding Moscow blameless for its previous assaults on American democracy. No wonder Putin did what he could to help Trump win the presidency-not once but thrice.\n\nThe Trumpers will tell you that \"Russia, Russia, Russia\" was a hoax, a witch hunt and a diabolical Deep State plot. That's another con that Trump whipped up, with a boatload of help from Patel . But as the Trump-Putin relationship returns to prominence and as an American sellout of Ukraine looms, it's important to keep in mind that Trump sits in the White House partly because of Putin's skullduggery and his own betrayal of America.\n\nYou don't have to take my word for it. Just ask Marco Rubio, who's now Trump's secretary of state. As I've pointed out before in this newsletter, in August 2020, Rubio, then the GOP chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, released a bipartisan 966-page report on the Trump-Russia scandal. It's the most comprehensive public account of Putin's attack on the 2016 election. It concludes that Putin \"ordered the Russian effort to hack computer networks and accounts affiliated with the Democratic Party and leak information damaging to Hillary Clinton and her campaign for president\" and that he did so \"to help the Trump Campaign...and undermine the US democratic process.\"\n\nThe report points out that \"the Trump Campaign publicly undermined the attribution of the hack-and-leak campaign to Russia\"-that is, Trump helped cover up Putin's culpability. The report also reveals that Paul Manafort, the chief executive of Trump's 2016 campaign, secretly met with a Russian intelligence office who was possibly connected to Russia's hack-and-leak operation and shared private campaign information with him. (Does that sound like possible collusion?)\n\nSo no hoax. Putin schemed to place Trump in the White House, and Trump aided and abetted the operation by falsely denying its existence.\n\nFor years, the Republicans and MAGA-aligned media used a Kremlin-orchestrated smear to advance the impression that Biden was crooked.\n\nThe Russian operation helped Trump win in 2016. In the final weeks of a tight election, it produced a steady stream of damaging leaks about Clinton that impeded her campaign. The Kremlin also ran secret projects that tried to assist Trump in 2020 and 2024. What's the source for that? The first Trump administration. In 2020, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center and the Treasury Department each publicly disclosed that Russia was conducting a disinformation campaign spreading false information about Joe Biden's actions in Ukraine to smear the former vice president and Trump's main rival. Rudy Giuliani, then a lawyer for Trump, peddled this phony, Russia-generated propaganda to try to undermine Biden's presidential campaign.\n\nSuch bunk became the basis for the long-running and false GOP narrative that Biden was corrupt. This line of attack failed in 2020, but the Republicans stuck with it. After they won control of the House of Representatives in 2022, they hyped the Biden allegations cooked up by Russian agents and used this disinformation to try to discredit Biden with the false charge that he headed a \"Biden crime family.\" They cited this bogus claim as the basis for an impeachment investigation. That probe went nowhere, but for years, the Republicans and MAGA-aligned media used the Kremlin-orchestrated smear to advance the impression that Biden was crooked-a sham that Trump enthusiastically promoted and exploited in the 2024 campaign.\n\nRussia's effort last year to help Trump was not a secret. In the spring of 2024, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines publicly testified before Congress that Russia was once again waging information warfare to influence the presidential election, obviously to benefit Trump. This would come to include a host of disinformation projects. But none of this became major news stories-a true failure of the media. And, it would turn out, one of the key false allegations the Republicans and their media mouthpieces pushed-that Biden and his son had covertly pocketed $10 million in bribes from a Ukrainian energy firm- originated with an FBI informant with ties to Russian intelligence officers. (In December, this informant, Alexander Smirnov, pleaded guilty to lying to the bureau about this supposed scheme.)\n\nWhatever the Russians did last year to help Trump will be buried by what we can now call the Trump Deep State.\n\nThere's been no good review of the operations the Kremlin implemented to swing the 2024 election to Trump. And with Trump in charge, Patel at the FBI, John Ratcliffe (another Trump loyalist) heading the CIA, and Tulsi Gabbard serving as the director of national intelligence, there's as much chance of one being ordered as Trump attending a racial sensitivity seminar. Whatever the Russians did last year to help Trump will be buried by what we can now call the Trump Deep State.\n\nThere's certainly a lot more to the Trump-Putin connection than this brief rundown. In 2013, when Trump announced he'd be holding his Miss Universe contest in Moscow, he tweeted about Putin becoming \"his new best friend.\" (Putin was already recognized at this point as an antidemocratic thug.) While in Moscow for the event, Trump was obsessed with meeting Putin -which never happened. But the Miss Universe pageant netted Trump $2.3 million-mostly because his partner in the endeavor, a Russian oligarch who was close to Putin, paid Trump a very generous licensing fee and absorbed millions in losses. (Was this a sweetheart deal with a pro-Putin billionaire?)\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Trump tried to set up a megadeal to develop a tower in Moscow and requested help from Putin's office. (He never told voters about this.) And his top campaign aides met with a Russian emissary after being informed the Kremlin wanted to secretly help his campaign. Of course, Trump has a long history of fawning remarks about Putin, and top administration officials during his first term wondered about his unending and bizarre affinity for Putin. (This past week the Mirror reported that a former Kazakh intelligence chief, who claimed he had served in the KGB, said that Trump was recruited by the KGB in 1987. There is no way to evaluate this claim.)\n\nThe Trump-Russia tale has largely been smothered by Trump's endless screams of \"witch hunt\" and \"hoax.\" But as Trump moves to help Putin obtain an advantageous end to the cruel and criminal war he initiated, the full context of their relationship ought to be center stage. Yet it's not been.\n\nOne example: Last week, the New York Times published a story reporting on Trump's \"familiar pattern\" of \"elevating Kremlin talking points\"-an accurate characterization. But not until halfway into the piece did it refer to Putin's attack on the 2016 election. The article said that the Senate Intelligence Committee report had concluded that the Russian government \"engaged in an aggressive, multifaceted effort to influence, or attempt to influence, the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.\" But the Times did not point out that the committee declared that this operation had been conducted to help Trump triumph. The newspaper noted the Russian endeavor had \"damaged\" Hillary Clinton's campaign but said nothing about Trump's attempt to cover up Russia's role. The Times also did not mention Putin's secret efforts in 2020 and 2024 to assist Trump. It downplayed the whole Trump-Russia saga.\n\nTrump is acting like Putin's handmaid-and pursuing policies and creating discord that could well undermine American democracy and fray, if not shatter, the Western alliance.\n\nTrump's love affair with Putin has been something of a mystery. Less mysterious is the basic fact that Putin helped Trump reach the White House initially and mounted covert actions in 2020 and 2024 to boost Trump's chances. What could be more relevant at a time when Trump is demonizing Zelenskyy and trying to broker a resolution of the war that will favor Putin and his regime over a democratically elected ally of the United States?\n\nPutin wanted Trump in the White House, and he screwed with American elections to make that happen. Now Trump is acting like Putin's handmaid-and pursuing policies and creating discord that could well undermine American democracy and fray, if not shatter, the Western alliance. MAGA refuses to see this. Congressional Republicans won't face it. And the media doesn't fully cover this all-important backstory. Whether or not there are secrets to the Trump-Putin relationship that we don't know, it's clear that Putin made a clever bet, and it looks like he's about to cash in.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

He's not a monarch ordained by a god.\n\nYet the president of the United States is not a king . He's not a monarch ordained by a god. As former President Barack Obama said in a \"60 Minutes\" interview in November 2020, the \"president is a public servant.\" The person elected to that office should represent and serve the public's best interest - not his own .\n\nAs mass protests against the Trump administration take place across the nation, let us remember the historical role and responsibility of the president and what others who've held the office have had to say about the responsibility that comes with the position. \"The President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants,\" former President Teddy Roosevelt wrote in a May 1918 editorial in The Kansas City Star. In 1954, former President Harry Truman said, \"I would much rather be an honorable public servant and known as such than to be the richest man in the world.\"\n\nThe president is supposed to serve us, the American people. Not just the people who voted for him or who donated to his campaign or inauguration - but all the people. Toward that end and in keeping with America's long-standing policies, Trump should be working to preserve and strengthen our democratic society and democracies around the world - not undermining them by playing nice with dictators.\n\nThe American people elected Trump and have entrusted him to serve their bests interests. \"Public service is a public trust,\" reads Executive Order 12674 from 1989, spelling out one of the primary principles of ethical conduct for government officers and employees. President Thomas Jefferson even asserted, \"When a man assumes a public trust, he should consider himself as public property .\"\n\nYou just have to laugh at the idea of Trump - who wants to privatize public services from the U.S. Postal Service to education and even sell off public lands to private interests - ever considering himself public property. The absolute, fiendishly calculated chaos he has unfurled in the first weeks of his second term proves that serving the public's best interest was never a part of his - or, let's be honest, Project 2025's - agenda. In that way, Trump, who has always loved flaunting his wealth, is the opposite of Truman.\n\nIn that 1918 editorial, Roosevelt asserted it was as important that the public \"blame [the president] when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right ... in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the nation as a whole.\"\n\nThe problem is that Trump and his supporters don't always appear to be committed to codes of ethical conduct or the law. And Trump has shown over the course of his career that he doesn't take accountability for his actions. \" Deny everything \" is one of the lessons he learned from his lawyer and mentor Roy Cohn . Trump has decimated independent federal agencies likely because they are units of accountability - specifically in terms of offering oversight and regulation - in our government system of \"checks and balances.\"\n\nTrump has shown over the course of his career that he doesn't take accountability for his actions.\n\nNotably, Roosevelt's words about the president being the most important public servant were not directed to then-President Woodrow Wilson but to his fellow Americans to encourage them \"to tell the truth about [the president's] acts. ... Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.\"\n\nIn other words, we, the American people, are responsible to each other to secure the health of our democracy. This means we must elect to office presidents who are committed to public service, and if we fail at that, then we must use our First Amendment rights to protest against them.\n\nThey're there to serve us, not the other way around.\n\nMarcie Bianco is a writer and editor based in California.

      "text": "Wall Street should have known better than to trust Donald Trump\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe stock market rose to record heights after Donald Trump's 2024 re-election. Wall Street reveled in Trump's promises of even more tax cuts and defanged regulators, not to mention making the world safe for saying all those politically incorrect thoughts about DEI. What could go wrong?\n\nPlenty, it turns out. Trump's only been in office two months and the S&P 500 is lower than it was before Nov. 6 and in correction territory. The risk of a recession is rising , and confidence for consumers and small businesses is plummeting, even as fears of inflation are increasing. Multiple Fortune 500 companies report a softening in consumer spending. The dreaded word \" stagflation \" is getting tossed around.\n\nThe Trump administration is hardly offering reassurance.\n\nNo wonder so few people, it seems, want to plan a getaway: The Conference Board reports that under 40% of Americans are planning a vacation in the next six months. In the last 40 years, that number has only been lower during the Covid-19 pandemic and the Great Recession.\n\nThe Trump administration is hardly offering reassurance. Not only do the president and staffers like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent refuse to rule out the possibility of a recession, they are even arguing that economic pain will result in a better future. The president called it \"a period of transition.\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted Trump's tariff policies will be \"worth it\" even if they lead to a recession.\n\nAs one banker told the Financial Times , \"With hindsight, we did not appreciate the nature of what the administration was going to be like.\"\n\nYou don't say.\n\nWall Street's enthusiasm for Donald Trump was always a triumph of hope over experience and evidence. True, absence makes the heart grow fonder, but there were signs everywhere, long before Trump was elected, that he was serious about tariffs - which Wall Street, rationally or irrationally, abhors - and other policies that have both roiled the markets and sparked warning signs in the economy since his inauguration. And if nothing else, you would think the chaotic management of the Covid pandemic and violent end of his first term would give the masters of the financial universe pause.\n\nIt did not.\n\nEven in the best of circumstances, Trump is a chaos monster. More than ever before, he's embraced chaos as both an economic and governing strategy. That is, you shouldn't need me to tell you, is a risky way to run an economy.\n\nFor example, there is a case to use tariffs in a way that is strategic, stable and reliable, and that would promote the long-term goal of strengthening the nation's manufacturing capacity. Trump's approach has none of these qualities. His goals include nonsense like attempting to annex Canada . He imposes them one day only to call them off the next. And even his choice of targets, according to Lutnick, depends not on any rational criteria but on which countries \"make him unhappy.\"\n\nFinancial markets and businesses crave stability and predictability; they react poorly to chaos and political favoritism.\n\nThe administration's approach to slashing government is another issue. Trump has allowed Elon Musk's minions at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency to fire tens of thousands of federal workers, cancel scores of federal contracts and even stiff businesses that have already performed work for the federal government. Many of these actions might well get reversed in the nation's courts, but for now, universities and other impacted businesses are instituting hiring freezes and laying off employees . Others - like former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley - fear that DOGE cuts to Social Security amid false claims of rampant fraud are risking a \"total system collapse.\" All this uncertainty and fear, in turn, is contributing to increasing consumer pessimism.\n\nThen there is Trump's open corruption and vengeance politics. He's attacking multiple law firms that have played a role in his various legal woes. At the same time, he and his family are profiting from everything from cryptocurrency sales to Amazon's $40 million deal to stream an \"unprecedented, behind-the-scenes\" documentary about Melania Trump.\n\nA s I have pointed out in the past , the United States is a financial giant not just because it is a resource-rich country. We are - or were - considered a stable country as well, where the rule of law is enforced fairly and consistently. Financial markets and businesses crave stability and predictability; they react poorly to chaos and political favoritism. Just as people need some assurance that their job will be there for them tomorrow before they make a big purchase, the same is true for businesses. They can't plan for the future if they don't have a secure sense of what their underlying expenses and sales will be - something that is increasingly impossible in the Trump economy.\n\n\"The problem for the markets is when they don't know what to do,\" said billionaire investor Marc Lasry last week . \"An economy can't survive like that.\"\n\nLet me reiterate that uncertainty is bad for all of us, not just the financial markets.\n\nThere's a pervasive myth that Republicans are better for the economy than Democrats. Nothing could be further from the truth. Job growth is higher when a Democrat is in the White House. The S&P 500 performs better under Democratic presidents. Nine out of the last 10 recessions - including each of the last five - have begun with a Republican sitting in the Oval Office.\n\nBut many who should know better don't want to believe the evidence.\n\nIt's all personal. Even as inequality soared to near-record levels, many of the wealthiest Americans - from Wall Street to Silicon Valley and everywhere in between - have insisted they were the true victims , lashing out at the Biden administration and complaining about any regulation or possible tax increase. These supposed financial experts let their greed and pique blind them to the reality that always was and always will be Donald Trump.\n\nHelaine R.

He has gone so far as to call for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg , who ordered the White House to halt its haphazard effort to deport Venezuelan migrants .\n\nTrump's attack on Boasberg prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, but the president's allies have nevertheless piled on.\n\nTrump's attack on Boasberg prompted a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts , but the president's allies have nevertheless piled on. GOP members of Congress who expressed support for impeaching judges who rule against the administration have also reportedly received a boost in donations from Musk , Trump's billionaire ally, who on Wednesday baselessly accused those judges of \"extreme abuse of the legal system.\"\n\nSome of those threats have made their way offline. The New York Times reported that judges have received bomb threats, swatting calls and even anonymous pizza deliveries to their homes as a veiled intimidation tactic.\n\nJudges' family members have also been targeted. Earlier this month, the sister of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett - who has come under fire from MAGA supporters over her recent rulings against the administration - was the target of a pipe bomb threat at her home, according to police in Charleston, South Carolina. The threat was determined to be a false alarm, police said.\n\nClarissa-Jan Lim is a breaking/trending news blogger for MSNBC Digital.

      "text": "Now is the time for Democrats to take political risks - before it is too late\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Chris Hayes\n\nThis is an adapted excerpt from the March 19 episode of \"All In with Chris Hayes.\"\n\nThe movement to resist Donald Trump 's unconstitutional power grab faces two fundamental questions: How bad are things right now? And when is it time to use every possible democratic means to slow his assault?\n\nThis is how democracies end. When independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer joined \"All In.\" The interview was clarifying in many ways, but one of my main takeaways is that there is a fundamental difference between how some people view this moment.\n\nSome people think we are in a constitutional crisis - that there is a plan in place to impose a dictatorship in the United States. On Tuesday's show, Schumer told me he was not quite ready to declare a constitutional crisis yet. Now, I truly hope Schumer is right, but it makes it very hard to imagine a leader \"meeting the moment\" if they don't believe the moment is even here.\n\nFor me, Trump's intentions are so clear. He is in the process of attempting to undo the constitutional republic. His executive branch is in the process of overtaking the legislative and judicial branches of government, Congress and the courts, so that he gets to act unilaterally.\n\nEven within his executive purview, this president is purging anything and anyone who falls short of pledging unshakable loyalty to him and his political project. From the FBI to the Justice Department to the Federal Trade Commission , these institutions are being cleared of career officials who may favor the rule of law over Trump's whims, and they are being replaced with loyalists.\n\nAs The New York Times reported , Trump is using the vast powers of the presidency to hobble his political opponents, including bogus investigations into Democratic fundraising platforms and threats to shut down nonprofit organizations he sees as oppositional.\n\nBut it's not just the government or partisan entities. Trump wants to dismantle all forms of public opposition to his power grab, starting with all sources of independent authority. Any institution with credibility must either be bent to Trump's will or destroyed.\n\nHe has repeatedly threatened independent media outlets, including this one , for coverage he deems to be insufficiently fawning. He is conducting an unprecedented attack on American higher education, including freezing $175 million in federal funding for his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania. And he is seemingly openly defying the Constitution as he tries to deport a legal resident over his protected political speech.\n\nThis is how democracies end - when independent voices of authority are purged and a pluralistic civil society is fractured. It is clear as day to so many of us, including scholars of authoritarian regimes and especially folks who have lived through those regimes.\n\nI think part of the issue, which is a legitimate concern, is how we got to this point. There is a sense among Democrats - one that is not totally wrong - that democracy is not a particularly salient political issue. Democrats spent the entire 2024 election cycle hammering their messaging about the threats to democracy and civil society, but voters were more concerned with pocketbook issues , like the cost of living. Therefore, some Democrats think democracy is a losing issue politically and that we should talk about Medicaid cuts or the effect of Trump's trade war on the economy.\n\nI understand the instinct to stick to these kitchen-table issues. I don't think it is necessarily the wrong lesson to have learned from the election. But the terrain has shifted too much since November. Democrats should not be fighting the last war. While that type of resistance worked eight years ago, now is not the time for politics as usual. This is a break-glass moment.\n\n'This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,' Sen. Chris Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday.\n\nFirst of all, Trump is already underwater on questions about the economy. The state of the stock market is doing a pretty good job messaging pocketbook issues all on its own. But more importantly: Democrats don't have to choose. It's all one thing. The threat to democracy has become so much more tangible than it was when folks went to the ballot four months ago, in part because Trump's entire mad king act is wreaking havoc in every direction.\n\nWith that in mind, a lot of Schumer's Democratic colleagues believe it's time to fight back harder, as Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut has been out there saying.\n\n\"This moment requires us to break norms; this moment requires us to take risks,\" Murphy told Jon Stewart on Monday . \"And I get it. A lot of my colleagues said shutting down the government, being in a government shutdown, that's a risk; that hands power to Donald Trump and Elon Musk. But how on Earth are we going to ask the American people to take risks for us, right, when there's a five-alarm constitutional fire and we need them to be out on the streets - not with hundreds, not with thousands or tens of thousands of people, but with hundreds of thousands of people - if we're not willing to take risks ourselves?\"\n\nNow is the time to take political risks - before it is too late. Not to oversimplify, but the whole point of America is that you cannot have one guy in charge of everything, without checks or balances. That is literally the foundational insight upon which the country was built. No kings. Not ever. There is quite possibly nothing that is more fundamentally American.\n\nChris Hayes hosts \"All In with Chris Hayes\" at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday through Friday on MSNBC.

They believe that his executive authority has more weight than the rule of law. But that is not the way our Constitution is designed - and that is not the way we have conducted business in the United States of America for almost 250 years.\n\nAcross the country, dozens of judges have blocked parts of Trump's agenda from going into effect. According to the president, these judges aren't basing their decisions on the rule of law. Instead, he claims they are \"radical left lunatics\" targeting his administration.\n\nTrump wants to blow up our rule of law, and frankly, way too many people who know better in his party are going along with it.\n\nHowever, according to an analysis from Adam Bonica , a professor of political science at Stanford University, that is not the case. He found that judges across ideological lines are ruling against Trump at a similar rate. Bonica also took the decisions handed down from the courts thus far and compared them to decisions from Trump's first administration. While a judge's ideology strongly predicted case outcomes back then, Trump's overreach during his second term has united judges across partisan divides.\n\n\"This isn't partisan opposition to Trump - it's the judiciary functioning as intended by cutting across partisan lines to uphold the Constitution,\" Bonica wrote.\n\nJudges are putting their political biases or ideology aside, they're looking at the Constitution and the rule of law, and they're making rulings in accordance with how our country is supposed to run. While Trump may find a friendly judge and succeed in one or two of these cases, there will likely be a lot more cases where Republican-appointed judges come down against this administration.\n\nTrump knows this. That's why the president and his allies are pushing for these judges to be impeached - but that's not happening. Impeaching a federal judge requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate. In the end, all Trump is doing is political theater and animating his base in a way that's very dangerous to people who sit on the bench.\n\nSimply rejecting or dismissing Trump's far-fetched push to impeach these judges isn't enough, however. I believe some of my former colleagues in Congress - people who have been in the system for a long time and have great faith in our constitutional checks and balances - have not fully grasped how far Trump has already gone.\n\nHe's taken inspiration from autocrats across the globe. He's targeted higher education , tried to shut down the free press and has ousted people from the federal government who may disagree with his positions. He is taking the U.S. to a place that is absolutely autocratic.\n\nForget any checks and balances when it comes to the legislative and executive branches: The president has a Republican-controlled Congress already bending the knee. I can't believe that more U.S. senators, especially those on the Judiciary Committee, have not spoken up about the president's threats against these judges.\n\nTrump wants to clear the field of any defenders of the Constitution. He wants to blow up our rule of law and put himself in charge. And frankly, way too many people who know better in his party are going along with it.\n\nClaire McCaskill, a Democrat, was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Missouri.

The same could be said for the drama surrounding the city's congestion pricing, which President Donald Trump said he would abruptly terminate last week in a very public showdown with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, or Adams' decision, after a meeting with Trump's border czar, to allow federal immigration authorities to operate on Rikers Island.\n\nThis is the nation's president declaring himself king as he bullies first a city, then a state, into submission.\n\nNow, it's easy to downplay all of these maneuvers as a local political spat that just happens to involve the president of the United States, himself a native New Yorker. But what Trump and his administration are doing goes far beyond New York. Trump is opening up another front in his war on America's system of checks and balances , targeting the separation of powers between federal, state and local authorities and the very principle of state sovereignty as outlined in the 10th Amendment: \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n\nFor many Americans watching this dramatic showdown between Trump and New York officials, there's a mix of amusement and disbelief. After facing backlash for his fights with New York, in which Hochul described him, derisively, as acting like a king, Trump declared on social media, \"LONG LIVE THE KING!\" His administration further trolled the American people by using official White House channels to post a fake magazine cover depicting Trump wearing a crown. The whole thing reads like a joke but this is real life. This is the nation's president declaring himself king as he bullies first a city, then a state, into submission.\n\nEvery crack in the armor of federalism, the philosophy around which this country was formed at its independence, brings us closer to autocracy. It's not out of the realm of possibility to now imagine the federal government declaring any policy it doesn't favor as an emergency that must be solved by them. Or a federal government that doesn't just cut apparent quid pro quo deals with a mayor or override a state governor, but one which deploys federal troops to our cities to crush state opposition and solve whatever it deems to be an emergency.\n\nIf you think this is a stretch, I want you to zoom out for a moment and consider what's happening in the broader context of Trump's strategy. He has defunded federal programs, sicced the Justice Department against his critics and used it to protect his supporters, and, potentially illegally, frozen billions of dollars in spending approved by Congress.\n\nTrump is systematically toppling the dominos of checks and balances: Usurping Congress' power, delegitimizing the judiciary and rejecting federalism - all things that were designed by the framers to prevent absolute executive power.\n\nJust last week, Trump escalated his seemingly unconstitutional power grab by signing an executive order that claims the authority to seize control of independent federal agencies - agencies that were specifically set up to be insulated from political pressures. This includes the Federal Election Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe order is sure to face a legal challenge as an overreach of presidential authority - but breaking the law might very well be the point. Trump's sweeping power grab is designed to advance a radical legal doctrine called the \"unitary executive theory,\" which envisions vast executive authority for the president, free from interference by Congress or the courts.\n\nEvery move on the chessboard is aimed at consolidating absolute control in Trump's hands. Trump is deliberately setting the stage for a Supreme Court showdown, where he knows he has a receptive audience among its ultra-conservative justices.\n\nAccording to the Brennan Center, the unitary executive theory \"is a fancy way of saying that a chief executive can rule over the executive branch like a monarch.\" Prominent legal historian Frank Bowman called it \"an open declaration of dictatorship.\" As one analyst put it, the only difference between what Trump is doing and a monarchy is that kings inherit their power.\n\nAnd don't think the 22nd Amendment, which limits a president to two terms, isn't next on the chopping block. Already, at least one conservative judge has given credence to the idea of overturning presidential term limits, despite the overwhelming legal consensus that it would be unconstitutional, and antidemocratic, to the core.\n\nAmerica's story, above all, is a struggle against tyranny, an underdog's fight against Goliath.\n\nWhile Congress appears to have consented to this broader takeover, and some judges appear ready to hold the line, the American people have stepped up, building organized resistance in all 50 states.\n\nWe are in the eye of the storm but generations before us in America have weathered their own storms. America's story, above all, is a struggle against tyranny, an underdog's fight against Goliath. Time and again, it was \"the people\" who redeemed America's soul, from suffrage to the Stonewall riots to the Civil Rights Movement to Black Lives Matter, where ordinary Americans risked their physical safety to confront injustice. From the Underground Railroad, when ordinary Americans stationed across the republic and with the help of their Canadian neighbors, risked everything to lead enslaved people to freedom. To Gettysburg, where thousands fought to preserve the Union and end slavery for good. All the way back to the nation's first revolt against tyranny, the Boston Tea Party, when grassroots resistance rose up against the English monarchy, two years before the Revolutionary War officially repudiated rule by a king.\n\nThis country has grown more inclusive and more democratic with each passing generation, and now, as democracy stands on the brink, the question is not whether history will repeat itself, or whether the people will rise to the moment -  they already are. The question is who will stand with you against injustice, for liberty and in defense of democracy. When the dust settles, when this moment becomes just another chapter in America's story, another hard-won victory for freedom, whose names will be remembered for standing on the right side of history?\n\nAli Velshi is the host of \"Velshi,\" which airs Saturdays and Sundays on MSNBC.

Activate your online access\n\nYesterday's executive order would dismantle the Department of Education, shutting down programs American families rely on.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds up the signed executive order to reduce the size and scope of the Education Department during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on March 20, 2025.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump signed an executive order yesterday stating his intention to \"begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all,\" he was doing more than implementing the standard DOGE agenda of cluelessly targeting phantom government waste . The Education Department, which Congress created in 1979, represents a key fulcrum in the right-wing theology of culture warfare. That's why dismantling most key functions of the agency is a centerpiece of the Trump administration's wrecking-ball tour through the administrative state: The agenda of publicly funded education has always been anathema to the modern conservative movement.\n\nLike the other agency death sentences issued by the second Trump administration-targeting other bête noires of the right like the United States Agency of International Development and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau-the pending cuts to the DOE will hit the most vulnerable populations the hardest. The department disburses $18.4 billion in Title I grants to high-poverty K-12 public schools, and $15.5 billion under a program for students with disabilities. Altogether, DOE grants make up 14 percent of the budgets for the nation's public schools. The agency also oversees the $1.6 trillion college loan program, which under the new Trump administration will likely devolve to other agencies with little incentive to continue reversing the crushing impact of student debt. The likeliest scenario, says Jeff Hauser of the executive branch watchdog group the Revolving Door Project, is that the fate of student loan relief will be decided by the forces of territorial inertia within the government. This critical authority will probably undergo a version of what's happened with USAID, whose skeletal remains are now housed mostly within the State Department. \"They are going to make cuts that will make mandated functions of the mission of various departments impossible to accomplish in order to take a maximal position prior to litigation,\" Hauser says, referencing the coming court challenges to Trump's order. \"Litigation may well lead them to a situation in which the functions are done in an illogical, restructured manner in another department; for example, Commerce or Treasury owning Federal Student Aid's remaining responsibilities.\"\n\nFor all the operational chaos ahead, however, the ideological brief behind the assault on the DOE is bracingly simple: to demolish the small-d democratic mission of public schooling in America. That agenda, as advanced in the early American republic, is to sustain democratic civic life by cultivating an informed citizenry-the central aim of 19th-century champions of the American common school such as Horace Mann. But translated into the register of right-wing culture grievance, the conduct of pedagogy in the service of public aims is a cunning expropriation of family sovereignty and parental authority. Historian Rick Perlstein spells out the core logic in a dissection of a 1970s-era tract on alleged faithless liberal indoctrination in the schools, Blackboard Tyranny . Written by Connie Marshner, a former apparatchik of the college-right activist group Young Americans for Freedom who later matriculated to the Heritage Foundation, the book turns the ideals of civic pedagogy on their head to summon forth an image of public schools as a fount of left-wing brainwashing and youthful rebellion:\n\nMothers have long observed that after the child starts school, the rest of the family starts catching more colds and flus. But other forms of disease are not so evident.\n\nWhat about the personality traits that start developing? What about the dissatisfaction with family rules and routines? What about boredom with learning loss of curiosity about ideas and the world at large? Why do children suddenly begin to complain about responsibilities toward little brothers or sisters? Why do they resent doing accustomed chores? Why does off-color language or unfamiliar slang suddenly crop up in a child's conversation?\n\nAs childhood yields to preadolescence and adolescence, and the condition gets worse, parents are told that these symptoms indicate normal stages of maturation. But when a mother is told by her high schooler, 'You don't know what's right and wrong for me' or 'You don't really care about me,' she knows in her heart that it is something more than youthful Sturm und Drang that is causing the anguish. It is not biologically mandated for human offspring to turn against their parents. But all the kids on the block are acting that same way, so Mrs. Middle America figures she must be oversensitive...until something provokes her to take a closer look at her children's public schools.\n\nIn many ways, Marshner's lament echoes the anti-pool soliloquy that traveling salesman Harold Hill delivers in The Music Man , and the underlying structure of grievance mongering remains the same. The only difference is that, instead of peddling marching band instruments and school uniforms, the right has tirelessly promoted what Trump is now poised to deliver: a completely privatized model of schooling. The successive late-20th-century right-wing scares about school psychologists, gay teachers, and sex ed, down through the latter-day moral panics over critical race theory and DEI administrators, all invoke, as Marshner did, the sacred prerogatives of family and parental control over children and their behavior. But they boil down to the same thing-a model of learning detached from any broader civic aim, and therefore prey to the same private interests that have carved up and throttled the rest of the country's public sphere.\n\nLinda McMahon, Trump's pick to head DOE-and now to oversee its pending deconstruction-is ideally suited to usher in a new age of school privatization . A former executive for the World Wrestling Federation, with no experience in education beyond a never-used teaching certificate, McMahon once chaired the central think tank of the MAGA movement , the America First Policy Institute. The policy shop enthusiastically supports privately funded charter schools, despite their decidedly equivocal educational track record, and also promotes education savings accounts (ESAs) to further realign school access on a market-driven grid. And like charter schools, ESAs reinforce, rather than mitigate, the steep inequalities of school systems chiefly funded by property tax payments: by directing lump-sum grants to parents and pupils, they leave them to navigate spending priorities on their own, so that some recipients have spent their allotments on school supplies (or non-school supplies ) before they can pay for enrollments. ESAs also short-circuit any public accountability in education funding; since they chiefly benefit private institutions, no governing board can field community complaints or concerns if, say, the schools stop teaching about the country's racist history , or face declining pass rates and test performances. Like today's charter-school movement, a massive expansion of ESAs promises to be a playground of fraud and grifting .\n\nSpeaking of educational grifts, one recent success story at the DOE prior to Trump's return to office was to help rein in the predations of the for-profit college racket. The personnel cuts that the Trump White House has already instituted in the department have effectively wiped out its oversight of this fraud-infested sector. \"There's a rule-it's called the 90-10 rule, under which these schools can get 90 percent of revenue from the government, and in their heyday, the larger for-profit universities got as much as $1 billion in Pell grants and other federal money,\" says Aaron Ament, president of the nonprofit advocacy group National Student Legal Defense Network. \"In the action announced last week, they have effectively fired every employee at the Office of Student Aid who participated in the oversight of for-profit universities.\"\n\nIn her confirmation hearings, McMahon herself conceded that the DOE can't be abolished without a vote from Congress-something that wouldn't happen even with GOP majorities in both chambers. That's why Trump is seeking to carry out the hit via massive layoffs and executive order-the same way that USAID and CFPB were hollowed out and abandoned. And it's why the order is already ticketed for a court challenge, by teachers unions, civil rights groups, and advocacy outfits like Ament's. Yet the same grim calculus that wiped out USAID and CFPB could prevail here, as a battery of hostile market and ideological actors prepare to transform another regulatory concern into a predator's ball.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

He was bending the knee.\n\nDonald Trump greets US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on his way to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025.\n\nDonald Trump, his chief of ghouls Stephen Miller, and his czar of white ethnonationalism Tom Homan have been making the rounds calling out \"rogue\" federal judges who dare to try to apply the law to Trump and his administration. Most recently, on Tuesday, Trump called for the impeachment of US District Judge James E. Boasberg, who ordered Trump to halt the deportations of Venezuelans to El Salvador-an order Trump ignored.\n\nTrump's call for impeachment (and the actual articles of impeachment that Republicans in Congress filed in an attempt to do Trump's bidding) seemed to trigger Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, and prompted him to pull out the weapon most preferred by institutionalists to fight the fascist takeover of the government: the sternly worded letter. Roberts issued a statement which read, in full: \"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"\n\nPeople who don't know any better have called this statement a rare \"rebuke\" of the sitting president from the Chief Justice. I urge people to not fall for the okiedoke, and to understand Roberts's statement for what it is: meaningless drivel from a man trying to protect his own stature instead of trying to protect the country from a tyrant.\n\nRoberts's letter telling Trump that impeachment is not an \"appropriate response\" to a judicial disagreement is like me telling Trump that he can't jump off his roof and fly. It's not a \"rebuke\" to tell somebody they shouldn't do what they physically can't do anyway.\n\nFor all of Trump's powers (both the ones he constitutionally has and the ones he unconstitutionally takes), impeachment of federal judges is simply not one of them. Impeachment of a federal judge follows the same rules as the impeachment of a president, so Trump should be familiar with the process. Impeachment charges have to be brought by the House of Representatives, and then the Senate presides over the trial. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to convict any federal official (including judges) on impeachment. Trump controls the House, but he doesn't control two-thirds of the Senate. Judge Boasberg is not Palestinian, so I don't think Chuck Schumer will give Trump the extra votes he needs.\n\nAnd Roberts knows all that. His statement is meaningless because it tells Trump not to do something he already can't do. Roberts is sprinting to the head of a parade already in motion, just to look like he's leading it.\n\nNow, let's look at what Roberts didn't say. Trump is in direct violation of Judge Boasberg's order, but Roberts didn't say boo about that. He didn't say, \"For two centuries, presidents have followed judicial orders, including a couple of years ago, when I ruled that women could be left to die from unwanted pregnancies, and the previous president followed my order like a compliant sap.\" Instead of admonishing Trump for directly violating a court order, Roberts invoked the \"normal appellate review process.\" It may sound like Roberts was saying that Trump should litigate his disagreements with Judge Boasberg in the normal way, but what he's really saying is that Trump should feel free to ignore lower-court orders until the Supreme Court has a chance to weigh in. By refusing to say anything about Trump's flagrant disregard for the lower court's judicial authority, Roberts is literally telling Trump what Trump wants to hear.\n\nRoberts is trying to maintain the appearance of power in the face of a president who has shown no inclination to respect it. He is trying, desperately, to avoid a judicial confrontation with Trump, while still wanting to sound like he is in control. That's why he's telling Trump to not do something he can't do (impeachment), but not telling Trump to follow orders that Trump is inclined to ignore.\n\nIt's a delicate game, but not one that Roberts invented. Roberts is taking his cues from another Chief Justice, John Marshall, who tried to maintain the appearance of judicial supremacy in the face of a different president, Thomas Jefferson, who was primed to ignore it. That entire dance played out in the first case every law student learns about in law school: 1803's Marbury v. Madison .\n\nAt issue in that case were commissions (new posts, including court officials and justices of the peace, created by Congress in the 1801 Judiciary Act) that President Jefferson did not want to fill. Congress ordered Jefferson to allow the commissioners (who were appointed by Jefferson's political rival, President John Adams) to be allowed to take their positions, as he was required to do by law, but Jefferson refused. One of the displaced commissioners, William Marbury, sued to compel Jefferson's secretary of state, James Madison, to allow him to go to work. (Is this all starting to sound familiar yet?)\n\nWhen the case reached Chief Justice Marshall's desk, he knew one thing for a locked fact: Jefferson was never going to fill those commissions. Marshall (who was also appointed by Adams) could have issued all the court orders in the world, and it wouldn't have mattered one whit to Jefferson. Marbury was never getting his job, and Jefferson would have called Marshall a partisan hack and told him to go pound sand if he ordered otherwise.\n\nSo Marshall deferred to Jefferson and reality. He ruled that Jefferson was wrong to not seat the commissioners, but that it didn't matter because the entire congressional law itself was unconstitutional, meaning that Madison and Jefferson didn't have to follow it. You could say that Marshall \"rebuked\" Madison and Jefferson, but he sure as hell didn't try to stop them, or order them to follow the law. Jefferson didn't want to seat those commissioners, and those commissioners were never seated.\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nThe case is famous because, with it, Marshall created, out of thin air, the entire concept of \"judicial review.\" The word \"unconstitutional\" does not appear anywhere in the Constitution. Marshall made it up, and gave his branch of government the sole authority to rule on what is and is not constitutional. The case is remembered as a stunning power grab by the Supreme Court, but don't overlook the fact that it was created in response to a president who was not going to follow any Supreme Court order against him, and that the outcome of the case involved an unhinged president getting exactly what he wanted.\n\nSo it is with Trump and Roberts. Trump is not going to follow a Supreme Court order he doesn't like, and everybody paying attention knows that, including Roberts. The only way for Roberts to avoid being exposed by Trump as unimportant is to defer to Trump on any matter of real import.\n\nRoberts will undoubtedly try to pull some John Marshall jujitsu in the coming months: He'll admonish Trump for his process of ignoring the law, but ultimately rule that the laws Trump won't follow anyway are unconstitutional. He knows Trump will violate his orders, so his entire plan will be to not issue an order that Trump can violate. The only times he might rule against Trump will be on matters, like birthright citizenship, where Trump cannot enforce his orders without the compliance of state and local functionaries Trump has no direct power over. On matters where Trump has all the power, like abducting immigrants and putting them on federal planes, Roberts will keep his mouth shut and his ass covered.\n\nJohn Roberts is not rebuking Donald Trump. He's bending the knee.

The complete closure of the department would require an act of Congress as it was established by statute in 1979-a fact McMahon has previously acknowledged.\n\nThe order will also detail stipulations that \"programs or activities receiving any remaining Department of Education funds will not advance DEI or gender ideology,\" according to the Internal document, which was labeled \"pre-decisional.\" As part of its rationale for the move, the administration cited plummeting standardized test scores as evidence that \"federal government control of education has failed students, parents, and teachers.\"\n\nThe Trump administration began weakening the department last week. On March 11, about 1,300 employees were laid off, approximately half of the department's workforce, The Nation previously reported . These employees were irate about Trump's decision and said that his justification for the order-returning education to state control-is redundant.\n\n\"Education has already been controlled at the state and local levels,\" one former employee told The Nation . They were granted anonymity for fear of jeopardizing their severance. \"It's hard to understand what the actual goal is here.\" Currently, the department has no say over the curricula that are used in schools. Instead, states are typically the ones that take the lead on developing and implementing curricula.\n\nAnother employee said the department \"only sets policy for the use of a tiny percentage of federal funds and keeps track of student performance on standardized tests,\" another employee said. \"Nothing about the shutting down of the department has to do with saving money or being efficient.\"\n\nEducation groups are livid over the decision. The American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten had just four words for Trump: \"See you in court.\"\n\nBecky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, the largest educators union in the United States, blasted the decision Wednesday night, saying it \"will hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle-class families, taking away special-education services for students with disabilities, and gutting student civil rights protections.\"\n\nThe administration has previously floated reassigning various functions of the department to other federal agencies. Project 2025, a Republican playbook compiled by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, suggested closing the department and moving some of its financial aid operations to the Treasury Department and the Office for Civil Rights to the Department of Justice\n\nIn seeing the reports of the upcoming signing, two employees described their reaction as \"heartbroken.\"\n\n\"Closing the department harms students and families,\" one said.\n\nOn the campaign trail , Trump repeatedly bashed the state of American education, saying that it had been taken over by \"the radical left maniacs.\" He has advocated for \"pro-America education\" and the creation of a credentialing body that would \"certify teachers who embrace patriotic values.\"\n\nMcMahon gave a preview of departmental reshuffling in an all-staff e-mail hours after she was sworn in as the department's secretary in early March: \"We will partner with Congress and other federal agencies to determine the best path forward to fulfill the expectations of the President and the American people.\"\n\nWithout a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and with a fractious coalition in the House, the prospect of passing a GOP-led bill to wholly shutter the department remains unlikely. But many hard-line Trump allies in the Republican Party have expressed support for the action.\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nIt is unclear whether Speaker Mike Johnson or Senate majority leader John Thune, who have the last say on which bills are brought to the floor of their respective chambers, support such congressional action. But they have been Trump's allies in the Capitol, uniting their caucuses to deliver policy wins for the new administration. Neither of their offices responded to a request for comment.\n\nBut as the administration has eyed a phaseout of the department, it has ramped up its oversight functions. Investigations have been opened into higher education institutions over allegations of antisemitism, funding cuts have been threatened for schools with race-conscious programs, and DEI is now anathema.\n\nOn March 7, the Education Department, alongside other federal agencies, canceled $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University over what it calls \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" Columbia is now in negotiations with the federal government, which is attempting to extract concessions from the university, including instituting a mask ban on campus, adding additional protest restrictions, and placing the department of Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies under \"academic receivership,\" meaning it would no longer be controlled by faculty.\n\n\"Legitimate questions about our practices and progress can be asked, and we will answer them,\" Columbia interim president Katrina Armstrong said in a Wednesday statement. \"But we will never compromise our values of pedagogical independence, our commitment to academic freedom, or our obligation to follow the law.\"\n\nUniversities have also paused hiring new staff, reduced the number of PhD admits, and issued travel warnings for international students in recent weeks, citing an ever-changing federal landscape. As Trump has threatened additional action against these institutions, administrators around the country have been left wondering whether they are next.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Referring to himself as \"the chief law enforcement officer in our country,\" he called for the agency to prosecute everybody from former special counsel Jack Smith to MSNBC and CNN to (apparently) anybody who writes or says mean things about him or his pet judge, Aileen Cannon. Even lawyer Norm Eisen, cofounder of The Contrarian ( a freaking Substack ), was singled out as a potential target.\n\nThis was, in many respects, standard operating procedure for Trump who, let's not forget, called for his first political opponent, Senator Hillary Clinton, to be locked up. Calling for legal vengeance against his political enemies has been a central theme of all of Trump's speeches since he came down his gilded escalator.\n\nTrump has articulated his plans to go after his political opponents with legal actions time and again, but what's significant about this version of his hour-long, rambling stump speech was where he gave it: inside the \"Great Hall\" at the Justice Department as the actual attorney general, Pam Bondi, and the FBI director, Kash Patel, looked on in rapt attendance. Only two other presidents have spoken in the hall this century: Bill Clinton, when he was trying to drum up support for his disastrous and racist 1994 crime bill, and George W. Bush, when he dedicated the building to Robert F. Kennedy (the one without the brain worms or the submission kink for measles). Presidents historically maintain a respectful distance between themselves and their attorneys general (unless they're brothers) to avoid the perception that the DOJ's actions are politically motivated.\n\nTrump broke from this tradition to lay out a clear agenda to turn the DOJ into his personalized legal strike force. With the speech, he officially declared his intention to reshape the legal system according to his will, and whims.\n\nTrump's hysterics at the DOJ are part of a larger piece: to go after the lawyers who might oppose him. At the DOJ, he highlighted Smith and Eisen as his enemies, but Trump has also issued two executive proclamations decrying the \"risk\" from specific law firms: Perkins Coie and Paul Weiss . He revoked security clearances for lawyers who work for both those firms, and is trying to prevent the government from contracting with any of their lawyers. Neither of those firms have done anything other than represent clients with legitimate claims against Trump, or his MAGA cabal, but in Trump world that is apparently a violation of his new legal world order. Trump wants to silence the lawyers, and he wants to use the lawyers at the Department of Justice to do it.\n\nOne imagines the bad-faith actors now running the Justice Department will gladly comply. Trump has gone out of his way to populate the DOJ with people of low character who will serve his will and not the law.\n\nAs happens so often with Trump, his speech at the DOJ has left us in the dangerous limbo zone between what he says he can do, what he can actually do, and what he can't do but will do anyway. Trump (or his sock puppet Bondi) cannot order the prosecution of his political enemies who have committed no crimes-at least he can't under the traditional understanding of law and justice. But if he does, who will stop him? The federal government's paramilitary police forces are now under the control of Trump, Bondi, and Patel. If they send their jackboots to round up Norm Eisen (or me, or you), who is going to tell them \"no\"? The courts? Ask Mahmoud Khalil how long it takes to be released from federal detention, even when your arrest is unlawful and you've committed no crime. Ask any one of the 137 Venezuelans, who were shaved and deported in a direct violation of a court order , whether the federal courts can \"stop\" Trump.\n\nOn Monday, Trump doubled-down on his DOJ speech by declaring that Joe Biden's preemptive pardons for people who had investigated Trump are \"VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT\" (all-caps in the original German). Clearly, this move is meant to set the stage for Trump to prosecute these people, which was essentially what he ordered the DOJ to do last week. I could tell you that no president can revoke the pardons of a previous president, if that makes you feel better. But I can also tell you that the presidential pardon power is largely untested in courts-and preemptive pardons are certainly untested-and Trump controls the Supreme Court. Again, saying that Trump \"can't\" do something doesn't actually stop Trump from doing it.\n\nAs with every fascist regime throughout history, the point of Trump's personal hijacking of the law enforcement apparatus is fear . Trump is trying to quell resistance to his junta by threatening prosecutions of anybody, especially the lawyers, who oppose him. He doesn't actually have to prosecute everybody, or even most people. The threat alone will chill a lot of people, and he only needs to pull off one or two high-profile prosecutions to prove that he's not bluffing. He and Bondi are not, for instance, going to charge everybody who defaces a Tesla dealership with domestic terrorism, but if he gets the DOJ to do it to just one person, then everybody will think twice before cursing out a Cybertruck owner in the parking lot of a CVS (which is not a crime, and there is absolutely no video evidence that I would do such an oddly specific thing).\n\nTrump's antics at the DOJ, and his larger agenda of \"lawfare\" against his political opponents, should alert those opponents to one crucial reality about living under a fascist regime: The law is not on our side. Too many liberals have lulled themselves into a false sense of security that \"the law,\" however defined, is on the side of justice. It's not. It never is when dictators take control. In authoritarian regimes, the law always ends up on the side of the oppressor, not the oppressed. You cannot fight fascists through the legal system, because fascists always change the law to make fighting them a crime.\n\nThat is what Trump announced at the DOJ last week. The institutions now work for the bad guys. Adjust your expectations, and your resistance strategies, accordingly.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Now we have this same question voiced by Donald Trump, and it's deadly serious. Trump has long maintained that there are good Jews and bad Jews. The good Jews fund his campaign and worship him for being, in his words, the Jews' \" big protector .\" In contrast, any bad Jew, one who opposes him, \" should have your head examined .\" Last year, he said menacingly , \"If we were to lose in 2024, Jews would be to blame.\"\n\nA week ago, Trump threw more kindling on the fire, saying that Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, an enthusiast of the Israeli occupation, was not only \"not Jewish\"; he was \" a Palestinian .\" I asked Rabbi Alissa Wise, the founder of Rabbis for Ceasefire, about the implicit threat in this cocktail of bigotry. \"Trump in one fell swoop used Palestinian as a derogatory slur and-as a non-Jew-elevated himself to arbiter of who is the right and wrong kind of Jew,\" Rabbi Wise said. \"This has gotten Jews murdered by authoritarian leaders like himself. Woe to the Jewish institutions, like the Anti-Defamation League, that continue to kiss his ring, playing Russian roulette with both Jewish and Palestinian lives.\"\n\nSchumer's response, suffice it to say, was not to reply, \"No, I'm not Palestinian. I don't have that privilege.\" Instead, after gutting the Democratic caucus, he hightailed it out of the Capitol for his book tour, a book about antisemitism . This is, of course, Schumer's version of antisemitism, personified more by college students fighting for Palestine than the authoritarian denying his claim to his faith. Either way, he shouldn't have rushed. The tour has now been postponed due to fear of protests organized by what was until recently his own base.\n\nToday's Christian nationalist sees Judaism not as a faith or culture but as a political marker. Step on the wrong side, and these Christian Zionists- a group that outnumbers Zionist Jews -will nullify your Judaism.\n\nTrump's mentor Vladimir Putin is fond of saying that Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy and \"ethnic Jews\" are \" not Jewish .\" This sentiment that our Judaism is fraudulent has also long been echoed by far-right Jewish Zionists who feel attacked in our critique of autocracy. Trump's former Israeli ambassador David Friedman once informed me, much to the surprise of my bubbe , that I am not, in fact, Jewish. These pompous, self-appointed arbiters of Judaism agree with what Trump said last year to former White House adviser and fascist sympathizer Sebastian Gorka : \"Any Jewish person who votes for Democrats hates their religion.\"\n\nPeople like Ambassador Friedman reject the proud Jewish saying that we are \"two people, three opinions.\" They prefer one opinion and will disappear the other person if necessary. Rabbi Brant Rosen, whose anti-Zionist Tzedek Chicago ( tzedek meaning justice in Hebrew) congregation was recently profiled on NPR, said to me, \"The 'good Jew/bad Jew' trope has been a hallmark of Christian antisemitism for centuries. Now we're seeing it revived by Christian nationalists, with fealty to a Jewish ethno-state serving as the new inflection point. What I find truly chilling is the extent to which some Jewish leaders, politicians, and organizations are willfully playing into it. This is a sick form of collaborationism-and certainly won't keep Jews safe.\"\n\nIt beggars belief that anyone thinks shuffling like a nebbish into the strongman's embrace while sacrificing a sizable portion of our community will ensure our survival. But our safety as Jews-and the safety of all of us-is even more imperiled now that \"fighting antisemitism\" has become the rationale for Trump's post-constitutional order. This regime's basis for having a secret police disappear Palestinian rights activists without due process for criticizing Israel is \"fighting antisemitism.\" The defunding of universities, the outlawing of academic departments, and the firing of Jewish professors is all part of its struggle to \"fight antisemitism.\" Then, clearly feeling itself after the extrajudicial arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, the White House tweeted with a bully's swagger, \"Shalom Mahmoud.\" It read like a nightclub comic, pimping our faith for a cheap laugh.\n\n\"The right-wing theft and misappropriation of the language of antisemitism has emptied it entirely of concern for Jewish safety and turned it inside out so the fascists and antisemites can use as a shield for their own violent agenda,\" Stefanie Fox of Jewish Voice for Peace told me.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nFeature / James North\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJewish Voice for Peace has been a frontline organization against the Israeli occupation. But even Israeli publications like Haaretz are pointing out that these policies endanger us.\n\nWhen Trump tells Schumer that he, as Great Leader, has revoked the senator's Jew card, it is a warning aimed well beyond the senator. When Elon Musk financially backs Germany's far-right Alternatif für Deutschland party, it is a warning. When the Sieg Heil -saluting Musk says that George Soros is behind the protests at Tesla dealerships, it is a warning. And especially when the Trump administration hires and appoints brazen antisemites, it's a warning to every Jew in the United States who rejects his protection racket.\n\nConsider the deputy press secretary for the Department of Defense, a 26-year-old nepo-baby named Kingsley Wilson. The daughter of the former Trump adviser who was too much of a conspiracist for NewsMax , Steve Cortes, Wilson has tweeted out Nazi slogans and even praised the lynching of Leo Frank . In case your knowledge of antisemitism only extends back a century, Frank was a Jewish factory owner who was hanged in 1915 in Georgia on false charges of raping and murdering a young girl. He was posthumously pardoned in 1986. Frank's murder spread fear throughout immigrant Jewish communities who thought they had found safe harbor from the anti-Jewish violence of Eastern Europe. \"Get him like Leo Frank\" was the sort of thing my immigrant grandfather heard walking the streets of Brooklyn as a child-and Frank's guilt is still maintained on neo-Nazi message boards. Both the Department of Defense and Wilson have refused to comment on the contention that the deputy press secretary's Leo Frank obsession has been drawn from the darkest corners of the Internet.\n\nThe people whom Trump has chosen to run the military are telling us what they think through their silence. They are saying that their Christian-nationalist acceptance of us is conditional upon fronting for the lie that this group of antisemites are shredding the Constitution to fight antisemitism. That is why it's so threatening to their project when Jews refuse to have our faith weaponized, and we chant, \"Not in our name!\"\n\nWe need to amplify testimonials like that of Columbia student Jonathan Ben-Menachem, who wrote an article titled , \"I Am a Jewish Student at Columbia. Mahmoud Khalil Is One of the Most Upstanding People I Have Ever Met.\" Ben-Menachem reminds us of what Khalil told CNN last spring: \"I believe that the liberation of the Palestinian people and the Jewish people are intertwined and go hand-by-hand, and you cannot achieve one without the other.\"\n\nWhen Jews and Jewish organizations occupied Trump Tower last week, leading to 100 arrests, Fox News was beside themselves. Anchor Harris Faulkner fumed on-air that these Jewish protesters \" hate Jewish Americans .\" Her normally cool demeanor cracked, as she alleged that these protests are what happens \"when you have open borders.\" I reached out to Faulkner to ask for evidence that these Jewish American protesters \"hate Jewish Americans\" or what she meant by invoking \"open borders,\" but she did not reply. Faulkner may have delivered her lines poorly, but the allegations make sense in Trumpworld. The unconstitutional immigration policy of this administration is being enacted in the name of Jewish safety. But it is also a warning that our own citizenship is revocable, that our loyalty is suspect, and that the borders can always close with the \"bad Jew\" on the other side looking in.\n\nFor decades, a minority of Jews have been telling hostile family and friends that our safety does not exist by the grace of the Israeli Occupation, that our only salvation is when we are in solidarity with the oppressed and refuse to allow our culture, religion, and history to be used as a tool to subjugate others. The choice now for American Jewry is clear: We can cower in the clutches of an administration that treats us like trash, or we can stand with those outside our faith pleading for us to call out the latest set of Big Lies: the lie that we are more secure when our rights are forfeited, the lie that victimizing others will keep us safe, and the lie that this collection of Jew-hating bigots gives a damn about antisemitism. The truth is that they hate us. We should have some pride and return the favor. Jew, not a Jew? Once a joke. Now an open threat.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The program, designed to give students a route into federal careers, was an opportunity to explore a field \"that feels fulfilling\" and could help her \"give back\" to the places that have served her: public service. But at the end of January, she received an e-mail informing her that the program had been canceled. The 22-year-old is one of thousands of young people across the nation affected by the Trump administration's funding freeze and job cuts across federal agencies in its first weeks.\n\nThese executive actions have raised concerns among college students and recent graduates, prompting some to reevaluate their career plans. Though having previously interned with the Environmental Protection Agency and the State Department, Natalie is now reconsidering her plans for a future working in federal agencies, eyeing opportunities with NGOs and on Capitol Hill. \"The federal government is just not a pathway that I see for myself going into, at least in the upcoming two years, and potentially, the upcoming full four years,\" she told The Nation .\n\n\"I am more focused now on state and local government rather than federal government,\" said Kye Benford, a freshman majoring in political science and government at Purdue University. \"Especially with what's happening-purges and firings of people-it doesn't seem very stable to go into that room.\"\n\nThe now-rescinded hiring freeze , initially set to take effect on January 28, led federal agencies to cancel numerous jobs, including thousands of legal internships and entry-level positions within federal departments. In recent weeks, Trump has also dismantled the US Agency for International Development, proposed eliminating the Department of Education, and temporarily shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, resulting in thousands of additional job losses. This marks a significant shift from a year ago, when the Biden administration updated regulations that expanded government internship opportunities to attract younger talent.\n\nWith internship programs and entry-level job opportunities being cut, these actions will weaken the role of the government and sow public distrust toward federal employees more broadly, according to critics. Trump's actions are \"certainly trying to undermine the civil service and increase public hostility toward government employees\" according to Peter Levine, a professor of citizenship and public affairs at Tufts University.\n\n\"I would imagine that serving in a federal executive branch position would become a much less attractive opportunity for most given the more precarious nature of these positions in the current moment,\" A. Benjamin Spencer, the dean of William and Mary Law School, told The Nation . He said that multiple students in this year's graduating class lost job offers from the Department of Justice and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nMahir Rahman, a junior at Brown University studying economics and international and public affairs, said that the recent funding and job cuts have made the internship search process \"a lot more challenging.\" Following graduation, Rahman plans to attend medical school and hopes to work at a public hospital, but cited the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) scrutiny of Medicare as a source of concern. \"It's making me want to consider different options,\" he said. \"Right now, there's just an air of uncertainty, because people don't really know what's going to happen next.\" Natalie said that the State Department did not provide a timeline for when internship positions would return-if at all.\n\n\"My plan was always to go into public service, and now I have to build up an entirely new network in the private sector,\" a recent law school graduate told The Nation . \"I had intended to spend my career in public service, ironically because it seemed like a stable option that would allow me to give back to my community,\" they said. \"Now, I can't imagine myself returning to public service unless I had no other options.\"\n\nIn 2024, 60 percent of young adults saw a career in public service as a meaningful way to make a positive impact on their communities. A separate 2023 poll found that 29 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds found public service work appealing. \"We know that young people really want a sense of purpose in their work-that's something that is especially apparent within the Gen Z population, and public service can be a way to get that sense of contributing to something larger than yourself,\" Nathan Hora, a senior adviser for federal policy at the National Youth Employment Coalition, told The Nation .\n\nHowever, Trump's recent attacks on public service could shift these views. Levine explained that during Trump's first term, his administration struggled to enact major policy changes because of congressional roadblocks. This time, however, Trump's team has identified ways to circumvent Congress by \"canceling contracts, issuing executive orders that conflict with federal laws, and firing employees.\" Levine added that young federal workers, particularly those in provisional roles, are especially vulnerable since they are easier to dismiss. \"I also assume that federal employment looks unattractive to many young people who might otherwise be interested,\" he said.\n\nLynn Hastings, a student at Purdue University, dreams of becoming a federal judge, but noted that her studies and work \"feels like it is all going down the drain. She's afraid that, because of executive orders affecting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs across the federal government, employers \"might not be as fair when seeing my application, as I am a Black woman from a lower-class background,\" she said.\n\n\"Just seeing how the White House and the executive branch have been acting is very concerning to see,\" Benford added. \"Would I be able to not only get a career there, but would I even be treated fairly?\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\n\"The American Dream is fading into a nightmare-especially for international students,\" said Aayushi Umbare, a high school junior from India. Umbare, a student with an interest in international relations who grew up in the states, is hesitant about returning to the country under the current administration. \"Long-term planning feels impossible, and that uncertainty is making it harder and harder to justify pursuing higher education and a career in the US.\"\n\nAlthough the long-term impact of these widespread hiring cuts remains uncertain, experts anticipate a decrease in young people's interest, engagement, and representation in the federal government-a likely goal of the new administration.\n\n\"If young people are not able to engage in internships and other early work experiences to hone their skills, make connections, and solidify their interests in public service and government work, it is likely to decrease both their interest in that work and their ability to develop the knowledge and skills to do that kind of work in the future,\" Dr. Robin Jacob, a research professor at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan and faculty codirector of the Youth Policy Lab, told The Nation . \"I think it is quite likely that we will see a decline in youth participation and representation in the federal government and in government more generally over the next several years.\"\n\nLevine believes that restoring the civil service may fall to the next generation. \"At some point, the executive branch will have to be rebuilt with hundreds of thousands of new workers, many of whom will be young,\" he said. \"Rebuilding the government is going to be the opportunity and the calling of Generation Z.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Activate your online access\n\nIt's only a matter of time before the administration expands its use of the Alien Enemies Act to ever-greater numbers of people from ever-greater numbers of countries.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, hundreds of people marched in Caracas to demand the release and repatriation of 238 Venezuelans sent by US President Donald Trump to a prison in El Salvador, accused of links to the El Tren de Aragua criminal gang.\n\nThis past week, the Trump administration revved the engines and, betting that its base would be enthused, barreled gleefully into a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act -yes, the same one that was infamously used in World War II as justification for the placing into concentration camps of tens of thousands of Japanese Americans-against a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe legal rationale for this unprecedented action, which allows Trump's ghastly deportation machine to entirely circumvent the judicial process and the immigration courts when dealing with alleged members of Tren de Aragua, was that the gang is invading the United States. While the gang is indeed responsible for many vicious crimes, there is no evidence to prove that it any way, shape, or form constitutes the advanced guard of a Venezuelan invasion force.\n\nThe ACLU immediately sued to block the use of this act, which it argued was never intended to be used against nongovernmental actors, and within hours US district judge James Boasberg, of the federal district court in Washington, DC, had issued a temporary restraining order .\n\nBoasberg was later informed that several planeloads of Venezuelan men were being deported from holding facilities in southern US states to El Salvador's notorious CECOT super-maximum-security prison, which already holds tens of thousands of gang members and alleged gang members of MS-13 and Barrio 18, and is arguably the harshest high-tech prison on earth. Human Rights Watch and other groups have documented widespread torture of suspected gang members and have also concluded that a large percentage of those in the facility aren't affiliated with the murderous gangs but have simply been caught up in government sweeps as the country tries to retake control from gangs that at one point had led to El Salvador having the world's highest murder rate.\n\nJudge Boasberg hurriedly convened a court session, issued a written order prohibiting such flights from the US to El Salvador, and backed it up with an oral order that aircraft already on route to El Salvador turn around and return the deportees to US soil.\n\nDespite Boasberg's order to halt these deportation flights, filled with more than 200 Venezuelan men, the administration kept the planes flying, and hours after the order was issued, the aircraft landed in El Salvador. There, the men were severely manhandled by masked security personnel, who paraded them, bent double and chained, in front of the cameras; dragged them to the CECOT facility; forcibly shaved their heads; and dressed them in flimsy white prison garb and dumped them into overcrowded cell blocks-in which they will live without any access to outdoor recreation, with only the bare minimum of food (the same meatless meals every day, with no cutlery allowed), and with, it is alleged, routine torture. At least 80 people are crammed into each cell, and the men sleep on stacked steel bed frames with no mattresses. The human rights group Cristosal has documented at least 261 deaths in El Salvador's prisons in the two years since the anti-gang crackdown began.\n\nTo the delight of Trump's people, far-right populist El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted on social media an \" Oopsie... too late \" comment about the judge's orders, and then announced that the deportees would face at least one year of hard labor in the CECOT facility. A Trump spokesman responded to Bukele's message , \"boom.\" Such is decorum and diplomacy in this age of monsters.\n\nIn the days since, hundreds of Venezuelan families in the US have struggled to work out where their sons, husbands, or fathers are. Meanwhile, Trump and Musk have both called for Boasberg's impeachment, with Trump writing that the judge is a \"radical left lunatic, a troublemaker and agitator\"-an astonishing attack on the independent judiciary that has to date met with a only a rather milquetoast critique from John Roberts, Supreme Court chief justice and midwife of the shameful Trump-is-king decision last year. ICE and Department of Justice officials have repeatedly stonewalled Boasberg's demands for clarification about the timing of the flights. And the hard-right social media eco-system has been inundated with violent threats against Boasberg and other judges seeking to uphold the rule of law in the face of Trump's escalating attacks on due process.\n\nLet's be absolutely clear about what has transpired: To fulfill a campaign promise to his base, Trump has unleashed a deportation machine against hundreds of immigrants who may or may not be gang affiliated; the government has released scant details on who these men are, making it impossible to know if they have been convicted of any crimes. These men have then been sent to what might well be the worst prison on earth, thousands of miles from their families, and have been informed by El Salvador's president that they will perform hard labor for the next year. That's not just a lack of due process; it's the literal enslavement of hundreds of people. And, whether it ultimately is ruled to be constitutional, it is monstrous both in its intent and its consequences.\n\n\"Oftentimes, the allegations of gang affiliations are because of tattoos, clothing, music,\" Boston-based longtime immigration attorney Matt Cameron told me. \"It doesn't take very much to get listed with a gang affiliation.\" Flash the wrong sign, listen to the wrong rap song, post the wrong thing on social media, ride in a car with gang members, get arrested with gang members-all this can get you onto a local police department or ICE database listing gang affiliates. It is, says Cameron, a catch-all, especially for young Latino men.\n\nWhen, in February, the Trump administration flew dozens of immigrants it labeled the worst of the worst gang members to detention in Guantánamo Bay, organizations such as the Immigrant Defenders, and journalists such as Pablo Manriquez , investigated the claims. For most, they could find no evidence of gang membership. It is at least possible that it will similarly turn out that some, or many, of those sent to El Salvador are also simply victims of the dragnet. Their lives, and those of their families, will have been ruined at the altar of Trump's sadistic obsessions.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nFeature / Vincent Bevins\n\nOf course, once the Trump administration normalizes the use of the Alien Enemies Act against the country's purported enemies-and once the flouting of court orders comes to be seen as business as usual-it will almost certainly expand its use not just against suspected Venezuelan gang members but against ever-greater numbers of people from ever-greater numbers of countries. It's a way to short-circuit any form of due process in the immigration system. And, says Cameron, ultimately the usage of extra-constitutional powers against perceived enemies won't stop with immigrants. \"Immigration is the tip of the spear for civil rights,\" he argues. What's to simply stop a mass process of exiling opponents, so they can't come back, he asks. \"This is a really terrifying development that should concern every American. You're sending someone to a place not under US jurisdiction that has known, sustained, human rights violations.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Pete Hegseth's defense department has been steaming ahead with plans to create a military buffer zone along parts of the southern border, and to then allow military personnel to hold migrants caught \"trespassing\" on military land , thus taking the administration right up to the line of violating the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nAnd on a near-daily basis, there is an escalation in the assault on academics involved in protesting Israel's brutal 18-month war in Gaza, or simply expressing social media views deemed to put them on the wrong side of the Trump-Netanyahu axis. Taken as a whole, these assaults represent the most serious threat to freedom of speech and to academic freedom since at least the McCarthy years.\n\nFirst, there was Palestinian activist Mamoud Khalil , one of the leaders of the Columbia University protests last year, arrested in his home despite his green-card status and sent to a detention facility in Louisiana to await deportation, allegedly for being a Hamas supporter. Then there was the Brown university kidney specialist, Dr. Rasha Alawieh , deported to Lebanon, allegedly for being a Hezbollah sympathizer. There was the case of Harvard PhD student Ranjani Srinivasan , forced to leave the US and head to Canada after her student visa was revoked for her participation in protests on Gaza. And on Wednesday, there was the detention of another Indian national, Georgetown University graduate student Badar Khan Suri , also subject to deportation for his political sentiments on the Middle East. At least some of these cases seem to involve actions contrary to those ordered by the courts.\n\nThese arrests are likely just the start of a mass purge of academia. Trump's regime, and Rubio's State Department, have explicitly promised a ramping up of arrests of academics-of those on student visas and of green-card holders. And the far-right pro-Israeli group Betar has boasted that it has given the administration a list of thousands of people it wants deported, including a number of naturalized citizens.\n\nDaily, I am reminded of the oft-repeated words of pastor Martin Niemöller (\"First they came for the Communists...\"). Daily, the circle of victims of this vicious regime grows as its willingness to abide by court orders, congressionally passed laws such as the Posse Comitatus, and constitutional norms declines. They are coming for the immigrants; they are coming for the academics; they are coming for the judges. They are coming for transgender Americans; they are coming for diversity, equity, and inclusion advocates; they are coming for public-sector workers. Among each group they target, they leave devastation and heartbreak and pain in their wake. These are the ashes created by MAGA's cauldron fires.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Activate your online access\n\nEveryone knows Trump is messing up, but fear and greed prevent resistance.\n\nNormally, it's a mistake to blame the fluctuations of the stock market on the actions of just one person-even if they are president of the United States. But there is nothing normal about the Trump era. The stock market is in a tizzy, and the fault is not hard to find: Donald Trump. The S&P 500 is down 10.1 percent from its peak a month ago, which means technically we're in a \"correction.\" If this slide continues on its current trajectory, it won't be long before the correction turns into an outright crash, bringing in its wake a recession.\n\nIn 1929, at the start of the stock market crash that inaugurated the Great Depression, Variety ran the famous headline : \"WALL STREET LAYS AN EGG.\" It's possible now to imagine the sequel: \"DONALD TRUMP LAYS AN EGG.\"\n\nThis economic turmoil is due to two factors: Trump's erratic policy shifts and Wall Street's initial misjudgment about Trump. When Trump won his second presidential term in November, Wall Street enjoyed a strong rally because it expected Trump to govern as he did in his first term. In 2017, Trump came into office talking like a radical economic populist-but his actual performance was as a standard big-business Republican, more interested in tax cuts and deregulation than industrial policy or empowering workers. True, Trump did initiate a new trade war with China (a policy Joe Biden continued) and renegotiated NAFTA (now rebranded the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or USMCA).\n\nBut both changes were less revolutionary than they seemed. The move toward seeing China as an economic threat had already started under Barack Obama ; and USMCA is basically a cosmetic change of NAFTA. In other words, both policies were part of a longer continuity. Beyond that, Trump often relied on standard Republican businessmen like Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, both avatars of the stability of well-entrenched capitalism. On foreign policy, Trump's reliance on military men like John Kelly and Mark Milley made sure he didn't stray too far from the national security consensus either. True, Trump's White House was a hothouse of intrigue and infighting, but in terms of policies it was much more like a conventional Republican administration than anyone had expected.\n\nAnticipating Trump 2.0 to be a repeat of Trump 1.0, Wall Street looked forward to another round of tax cuts and deregulation, with the threat of a new trade war viewed as largely rhetorical. Unfortunately, Trump and his circle had been radicalized by being out of office. Trump seems to have decided that for his second term as president, he really was going to live up to the MAGA agenda of protectionism and foreign policy unilateralism.\n\nInstead of Steven Mnuchin, Trump's main economic adviser now is Elon Musk-a product not of blue-chip Wall Street but of swashbuckling Silicon Valley. Musk, now tasked with gutting the administrative state, came from a world where disrupting entrenched practices and government/business synergy are seen as the keys to wealth. Suddenly, acne-infested Sanford students-some of them literal teenagers-were in charge of slashing government agencies.\n\nTrump's Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, shares his boss's passion for kicking-and-biting tariff fights. The United States suddenly found itself in a series of tussles with Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union. These trading partners also expected a return to the transactional Trump of the first term and were startled to discover that this time he's really committed, although erratically so, to trade wars. The pattern over the past few weeks is for Trump to raise tariffs-and then start lowering them when met with retaliation and when the stock market sinks.\n\nAs The New York Times reports , European officials were shocked when Trump turned out not to be \"transactional\" but simply irrational:\n\nAs a tit-for-tat trade war kicks into gear, Europe is facing a difficult reality. It is not clear to many European officials what exactly Mr. Trump wants. Tariffs are sometimes explained by administration officials as an effort to level the playing field, but they are also cited as a tool for raising money for U.S. coffers to pay for tax cuts, or floated as a way to punish the E.U. for its regulation of technology companies.\n\nTrump's incoherent policy, which shifts wildly from day to day, is spooking Wall Street. Another New York Times article reports that the current stock market slide is motivated by \"investors' growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements coming from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.\"\n\nWall Street might be uneasy, but it is also, so far, remaining quiet. A major feature of Trump's second term is not only a much more radical set of policies but also a pervasive fear in many institutions of offending the president, who has shown every inclination to use both his bully pulpit and the instruments of state power to punish perceived enemies.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported , \"How business leaders talk about the Trump administration in private has been markedly different than what they are game to say in public.\"\n\nThe newspaper cited a recent meeting of a Yale CEO Caucus attended by such high rollers as JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, billionaire Michael Dell, and Pfizer's Albert Bourla. According to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who participated in the private meeting, \"There was universal revulsion against the Trump economic policies. They're also especially horrified about Canada.\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nDespite these private worries, these CEOs are apparently not willing to voice public rebukes of Trump. According to The Wall Street Journal , \"asked how much the stock market would need to decline for them to speak out collectively, 44% said it would have to fall 20%. Another 22% said stocks would have to fall 30% before they would take a stand.\"\n\nThis silence is partly due to political agreement with the rest of Trump's economic agenda-particularly tax cuts and deregulation. It's also due to cowardice, as \"they worry public criticism will make them a target of the president's bully pulpit.\"\n\nThe self-censorship of Wall Street is of a piece with the larger failure of the American elite in the Trump era. Institution after institution-both political parties, the media, the academy-continue to surrender to Trump despite expressing private concerns about the dangers of his policy.\n\nThe only hope for resistance to Trump comes not from the elite but from the people. Voters are just as worried about Trump's mishandling of the economy as Wall Street is. There seems to be a sea change in public opinion. Because of robust job growth in his first term, Trump has usually been rated highly as an economic manager. This is no longer the case. On Wednesday, Politico reported , \"When asked about how Trump is handling the economy, 56 percent of adults said they disapprove and 44 said they approved, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released Wednesday morning .\"\n\nThe public anger at Trump's economic policy can be seen in town halls, where voters berate Republican lawmakers for complicity and Democratic lawmakers for cowardice. It can also be seen in the large crowds Senator Bernie Sanders is drawing in rallies against Trump. The open question is how long it will take for the Democratic Party as a whole to start following Sanders's lead.\n\nWall Street will never be at the forefront of resisting Trump, which means the job falls to the people themselves-and any politician brave enough to take up the fight.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

      "text": "Decades Ago, Columbia Refused to Pay Trump $400 Million\n\nCampus Crackdown\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nA quarter-century ago, the university was looking to expand. It considered, and rejected, property owned by Donald Trump. He did not forget it.\n\nBy Matthew Haag and Katherine Rosman\n\nDonald Trump was demanding $400 million from Columbia University.\n\nWhen he did not get his way, he stormed out of a meeting with university trustees and later publicly castigated the university president as \"a dummy\" and \"a total moron.\"\n\nThat drama dates back 25 years.\n\nToday, these two New York City institutions - the billionaire president of the United States and the 270-year-old Ivy League university that has cultivated 87 Nobel laureates - have been locked in an extraordinary clash involving free speech, academic freedom and the federal government's role in funding higher education.\n\nThe first battle between Mr. Trump and Columbia involved the most New York of New York prizes. It was over a lucrative real estate deal, according to interviews with 17 real estate investors and former university administrators and insiders, as well as contemporaneous news articles.\n\nSome former university officials are quietly wondering whether the ultimately unsuccessful property transaction sowed the seeds of Mr. Trump's current focus on Columbia. His administration has demanded that the university turn over vast control of its policies and even curricular decisions in its effort to quell antisemitism on campus. It has also canceled federal grants and contracts at Columbia - valued at $400 million.\n\nOn Friday, Columbia conceded some of Mr. Trump's demands regarding its protest policies, security practices and Middle Eastern studies department. The move alarmed some faculty members who worried that the university agreed to the changes in an effort to win back the full $400 million. The Trump Organization and the White House declined to comment.\n\nIn the previous dispute, Lee C. Bollinger, the former president of Columbia who eventually opted not to pursue the property owned by Mr. Trump, chose instead to expand the Columbia campus on land adjacent to the university. \"I wanted for Columbia a much more ambitious project than the Trump property would permit, and one that would fit with the surrounding properties, that would blend in with the Morningside campus and the Harlem community,\" he said in an interview.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Trump Voters Love Him More Than Before. Four Conservative Columnists Pinpoint Why.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nDavid Brooks, Ross Douthat, David French and Bret Stephens\n\nBy David Brooks Ross Douthat David French and Bret Stephens\n\nMr. Brooks, Mr. Douthat, Mr. French and Mr. Stephens are Opinion columnists.\n\n Patrick Healy, the deputy Opinion editor, hosted an online conversation with four Times Opinion columnists about the Trump administration's popularity among Republicans and why so many in the party believe the country is heading in the right direction.\n\nPatrick Healy: David, Bret, David, Ross: Donald Trump is the only president in our lifetimes who's had a net-negative job approval rating in his first 100 days in office . Trump also has the largest gap in approval ratings in 80 years - 90 percent of Republicans like his performance, while only 4 percent of Democrats do. Those Trump supporters are really on board with him; more registered voters think America is on the right track than at any other point since 2004, according to a new NBC News poll. To be clear, a majority still say America's on the wrong track, and Trump's polling on the economy is sagging. But I want to dig into why more voters feel better about America's direction now than compared with under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Trump 1.0.\n\nAnd I wanted to do so through the eyes of my more conservative colleagues. The four of you span the ideological spectrum on the right , and you've all written extensively about Trump. Why do so many Republicans like the direction Trump is taking the country in? Is it about his style or his policies or the mind-set and mood of the G.O.P. or something else?\n\nDavid Brooks: I'd start with the world we've been living in for the last decade or so. According to an Ipsos survey last year, 59 percent of Americans think our country is in decline. Sixty percent believe \"the system is broken.\" Sixty-nine percent believe the \"political and economic elite don't care about hard-working people.\" If those are your priors, then you're going to be happy with a president who wields a wrecking ball.\n\nHealy: As Trump liked to say while campaigning, \"What the hell do you have to lose?\"\n\nBrooks: I'd add another phrase: \"brokenism.\" This is the belief system popularized by Alana Newhouse in Tablet magazine in 2022. It's the idea that everything is broken and we just need to burn it all down. Personally, I think some things are broken and some things are OK, but most of my Trump-supporting friends are brokenists. They get this from media consumption. Do you remember that 2013 study that people who consumed a lot of media about the Boston Marathon bombing experienced \"higher acute stress\" than those who were actually at the bombing? There's something about screens that contributes to a catastrophizing mind-set.\n\nDavid French: In addition to the brokenism that David talks about, there's a strong undercurrent of raw animosity in our politics. Republicans and Democrats have very negative views of each other, and many Republicans, sadly, want their opponents to suffer. They're actually happy to see people lose their jobs or to see nonprofits lose funding if those people are perceived as part of the \"deep state\" or RINOs.\n\nExcept for Trump's open disregard for the judiciary, I don't care about his other actions. No one is going to care about pronouns or foreign aid if the constitution is dismantled without a vote.\n\n@JR I'm reminded of my friend Yuval Levin's observation that he's more concerned with constitutionalism than policy. The structure of our republic is far more important than any given policy change. What's especially disturbing is that Trump is attempting a constitutional revolution while his party controls both houses of Congress. He has more than enough political power to change American policy in conventional ways, through lawmaking rather than executive decrees. But he's choosing a direct attack on the constitutional order.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Democrats Need to Face Why Trump Won\n\nnew video loaded: Democrats Need to Face Why Trump Won\n\ntranscript\n\nI've been spending some time recently with top Democrats, as they think about how to rebuild after the 2024 loss. And I'll say that in some years I've been covering politics, I have never heard them so confused. America is back. How could they possibly lost this election to this person. Also, how is the Democratic Party weakening. So much among groups whose strength, whose support it once took for granted. Young voters. Non-white voters. Working class voters. What does it mean that the Democratic Party is losing what was once its base, its reliable base. Someone whose analysis on this have come to respect over the years is David Shor. David Shor is the head of data science at blowers research, which is a big Democratic consulting firm. So first, this is a big table of numbers. It does a huge amount of political surveying and interpretation of data and testing of messaging. And he's gotten a lot of things right before other people did, including that educational polarization was becoming the central fault line for American democracy. And so when I saw Shor recently and he began walking me through some of his slides, some of the ways he was interpreting the 2024 election and trying to help people see what had happened. My first thought was this would be worth doing in public, rather than this being a thing that Democrats are debating in Backrooms with each other. What if we did this in public. And so this episode is a bit of an experiment. He's walking me through this presentation and I am interrogating it. But I found this really, really helpful. I don't necessarily have every conclusion, David does, but I think it is a good place to begin. And there's then a lot that can follow from having this conversation. As always, my email at nytimes.com. David Shor, welcome to the show. Excited to be here. So what do you do. And why should I trust the data you're about to show us here. I'm glad. I'm glad you asked. I'm the co-founder of a research firm called blue rose research. We did 26 million interviews last year, and we have a team of about 45 people, machine learning engineers, software engineers from companies like Google. And, we've done a lot of work to try to figure out what actually happened last year. A lot of liberals I feel really burnt by survey data. There's a sense that nobody picks up the phone. How are you surveying these older people if you're doing it online. Putting aside the fact that you conducted a lot of surveys, why are you confident those surveys reflect reality. The fundamental problem with survey research is just that people who answer surveys are really weird. There's two ways that you can try to fix that. One is that you could try to get a normal representative set of people. That's just impossible in today's day and age. And the other is that you can just try to collect a lot of information so that you can adjust for how weird they are. The reason I feel fairly confident about this is just in our work, every time we make any change to any part of our system, we go back and back, test and see how it affects accuracy across every other election that we've ever surveyed. We can't be fully confident about any particular thing that we say. A lot of the data isn't back yet, but I think that there's enough data to tell a coherent story. There's the 26 million survey respondents of 8 million unique people. There's precinct and County level election results. We're also going to try to tie together all of the external data that other people have done. And what I'll say about this election is that our forecast. This cycle were very accurate. Our overall error was about 1/3 of a percent nationally. And I think that a lot most of the things that we thought would happen. Did bear out. And I do want to spend a second to answer, something that you had asked a second ago, which is just like, why look at survey data. I think that Super politically engaged people are overrepresented at every single step of the political process. They're more likely to run for office. They're more likely to work in campaigns and journalism. They're more likely to listen to podcasts like this one. And I think that they're really the only point other than election day, when regular people get a say is in polls. And so I think there isn't really any Democratic alternative to trying to listen to the people and hear what they have to say. So I take that point. I always think it is good to remind me and everybody who listens to the show that they are weird. And if their intuitions about politics were shared, politics would not look the way it does at all. Right If the voting population were, show listeners and people they then elections end up very differently. So I take your point on survey data. So where do we begin. All right. So first I'm just going to start with this slide over here that just looks at support for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020 and 2024 by race and ideology. In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates, and in 2024, Democrats got 58 percent of Hispanic moderates. That's only about 7 percent more than the 52 percent that they got of white moderates. The main story with respect to this is just a continuation of the trends that we saw four years ago. Throughout the entire Trump campaign, we've seen this racial polarization. The thing I find most surprising here is you look at white voters liberal, moderate and conservative. And at least in this data from 2016 to 2024, there is a 0 percent swing in any of them, because there are all these things that if you go back to the debates we were having about Donald Trump, then it is the return and resurgence of a coalition trying to protect white power in this country. And I wrote things about this. I think there was good reason to believe that even if that was part of the intention, then that does not appear in the results. So the Democrats lose modest amount of support among Black voters in those years. They lose a huge amount of support among Hispanic voters and a significant amount among Asian voters. Why do you think that is. I think that a lot of political analysis in America has been really centered around viewing everything through a very America centric lens, because there's this story in American politics. If you want to understand 20th century American politics, then the big story is that there was this giant Southern realignment in 1964, driven by the Civil Rights Act, driven by the Civil Rights Act, and that carried forward. It took a really long time for that to really work its way through downballot. And so I think it was really tempting for American political scientists and a lot. The more detail oriented American political pundits to just kind of see everything. People who wrote books like why were polarized, for instance. Yeah, exactly just to see everything through this transformation. Thomas Piketty actually recently wrote a great book about this thing I'm about to talk about. But I think the most important trend politically of the last 30 to 40 years, both here and in every other country in the world, at least Western country that has elections has been the story of education, polarization. That basically everywhere we've seen highly educated people move to the left and working class people move to the right. I think a lot of people's analytical error when looking at Trump is that they saw Trump as this kind of reincarnation of the 1960s of like George Wallace or something, when really I think he was representing this global trend. You could look at a bunch of other countries. You have Marine Le Pen in France, you have the AFD in Germany. And I think that people miss that. There was kind of a broader global appeal, this kind of polarization on values. The other thing that I find interesting here is the shift in voters who self-describe as conservative, right. There's no shift in white, self-described conservative voters between 2016 and 2024, but Democrats are winning 85 percent of Black conservatives in 2016, but only 77 percent in 2024. They're winning 34 percent of conservative Hispanics in 2016. That falls by half to 17 percent in 2024. They're winning 28 percent of conservative Asians in 2016. That falls to 20 percent in 2024. So it's always a little bit weird for somebody who is self-described conservative to be voting for Democrats who are quite a Liberal Party now. But what we're seeing among nonwhite voters is people voting more their ideology and less their ethnic group. That's exactly right. And I would just say, I think this shouldn't be that surprising. I think now, we identify the Democratic Party as straightforwardly liberal. The Democratic Party used to be a coalition between liberals and moderates and conservatives. And as liberals kind of became the dominant coalition partner. It makes sense, that the conservatives and moderates in our coalition, who were disproportionately nonwhite, given that this ideological polarization happened among whites 20 years ago or 30 years ago, that you would start to see this. All right. Let's move to slide two here. All right. But there were some new trends this cycle. So I can hear you going to presentation voice. Yeah great. Great, great. You're good. So this slide over here has what I think is probably the most important story of this cycle. So I have two graphs over here. The first breaks down 2020 for support by whether or not you had voted in 2020. And so this is New York Times' data from Nate Cohen's upshot polling, probably the highest quality public pollster in America. And what you can see here is just that in 2020, in their data, people who didn't vote if they had voted would have been a little bit more Democratic than the country overall. But over the next four years, people who didn't vote went from being a somewhat Democratic leaning group to a group that Trump won by double digits. So the second graph here, we have for every precinct, we look at what percentage of people voted in 2022. And then we just look at what was the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024. And so what you can see here is that for the lowest turnout precincts, Trump increased his vote share by something like 6 percent While for the highest turnout precincts, Harris actually increased her support. And that's really the story of this election is that people who follow news really closely, who get their news from traditional media, who say that politics is an important part of their identity. They became more Democratic in absolute terms. But for people who don't follow politics closely at all, they just became a lot more Republican. It's interesting because I obviously get a lot of incoming from people who would like the New York Times' to cover Donald Trump differently. And some of those arguments I agree with, some of them I don't. That's what I always think about with that, though, is that if your lever is New York Times' headlines, you're not affecting the voters you are losing. And the question Democrats are facing. When you look at how badly they lost less politically engaged voters is, how do you change the views of voters. You don't really have a good way to reach. Yeah, and I mean, that's 100 percent And, I just want to stress that this is a new problem. This problem didn't exist four years ago. And it's not just that New York Times' readers are more liberal than the overall population. That's definitely true. It's that they're more liberal than they were four years ago, even though the country went the other way. And so there's this great political divergence between people who consume all the news sources that we know about and read about versus the people who don't. And so, as a result of these changes, we're really this is really reversed, a decades long truism in American politics where for the longest time, Democrats have said, and it's been true, that if everybody votes, we win. And that higher turnout is good for Democrats, and this is the first cycle where that definitively became the opposite of true. Here I just have some numbers. If only people who had voted in 2022 had voted, Harris would have won the popular vote and also the electoral college fairly easily. While if everyone had voted, Trump would have won the popular vote by nearly 5 points. Generally, what you see now is that every measure of socioeconomic status and political engagement is just monotonically related to your chance of liking Trump. What is monotonically related. Yeah sorry. Just that this is why Democrats can't win. That's exactly right. I'm the problem. But it's basically just that the more even the lowest political engagement categories, the lowest education categories, the poorer the lower socioeconomic status, the less engaged you are in politics now, the more Trumpy you are. And that just wasn't true four years ago. So here here's something that I've heard from a lot of Democrats and very good election analysts, which seems to be in some tension here. There is an argument that what happened to Democrats between 2020 and 2024 is their voters stayed home. And so what happened here was a shrinking of the electorate that disproportionately sliced off what Democrats for a while were calling the anti MAGA coalition. How does that idea that Democrats didn't lose to Trump, they lost to the couch set with you. It's just not empirically correct. I would say generally turnout and support go in the same direction for the basic reason that there are a lot of people who didn't feel ready to vote for a Republican but were still mad at the Democratic Party, and so they stayed home in response. And if you just look at the demographics of who these people are, who voted for Biden last time and stayed home this time, they're generally low education. They're fairly politically disengaged. They're much less likely to watch shows like MSNBC and more likely to watch shows like Fox, and they frankly just look a lot like the voters who trended away from us. So if you had forced them out to vote, they may have just voted for Donald Trump. Exactly And that does show up. If you look at African-Americans, for example, African-Americans who didn't vote were much more likely to say that they supported Trump than the ones that did this cycle. It's true that overall turnout fell in a lot of the country, but in the battleground states that actually decided the presidential election, turnout was roughly where it was from four years ago. And it just is clear as day that a bunch of people changed their mind. How much is this just inflation. You are dealing with people who they're not paying a lot of attention to politics. They do pay attention and feel prices and the state of the country. You had a massive inflationary period and they're pissed and being pissed about inflation. Move them against the incumbent party, which they held responsible in this country, as in other countries, for inflation. I think that that's a very reasonable explanation. It makes sense that the people who care the least about politics are going to be the most mad about prices going up, and there's a lot of academic reasons to think that makes sense. I'm not making any claims, per se, about why this happened, though I think inflation makes sense. If you actually poll these non-voters and ask them what did they care the most about they'll tell you inflation. I'll get to this later. But that's what every single subgroup of the electorate cared the most about by overwhelming margins. And so I don't think it's necessarily true that it's impossible for us to win those voters back. But, I'll talk about this later. There have been dramatic shifts in the media consumption habits of these people in the last four years. And so it may be a harder problem. Before you discuss, I think it's worth talking to the next chart, too, because it's getting at the same question in a different way. So here, we have a plot that we just took from The Economist. And in the bottom, we just have foreign born population and on the top we just have increase in Republican vote share. And what you could see is there's a very clear correlation. This is by County. This is by County. There's a very clear correlation between how many immigrants there were in a County and how much it increased by Donald Trump, towards Trump. You can see in counties like Queens, New York or miami-dade and Florida. Trump increased his vote share percentage by 10 percentage points, which is just crazy. And so when we go and we look at the precinct election results, what we see is that in immigrant communities of all races, our best guess is that immigrants went from being a Biden plus 27 group in 2020 to a group that Trump narrowly won in 2024. This group, of naturalized citizens is roughly 10 percent of the electorate. So that means that immigrants swung much, much, much more than the median of the electorate. That's exactly right. Our estimates, and it's really hard to know exactly what happened. It turns out that working class immigrants do not answer a ton of surveys, but our best guess is that they swung 23 percentage points against the Democratic Party. And so the crazy thing is, if you believe this and there's some uncertainty, but I think some version of this is probably true, then something like half of the net votes that Trump received came from immigrants. And this wasn't efficient for him. It's one of the big reasons, why the bias of the electoral college went down by so much this cycle. Because if you look in the battleground states, things swung toward Trump maybe by like half a percentage point. And that was enough for him to win or one percentage point. But if you look at the four biggest states where immigrants are concentrated New York, California, Texas, Trump did extremely well. And so it wasn't very efficient for him. But in terms of people changing their mind It was a massive percentage of the story. So this gets to another way that I think the data has proven conventional wisdom from at least 2020 wrong. So 2020, you have an election that Joe Biden wins. He wins by less than the polling says he will win by. And one reason he wins by less than the polling says he'll win by, is that Donald Trump does much better with Hispanic and Asian voters than he was expected to. And I remember seeing pretty strong research afterwards and talking to people who study the Hispanic vote who were saying, well, in 2020, the pandemic really scrambled what the election was about. So in 2016, the election was about immigration. In 2020, it was about the pandemic. It was about lockdowns. It was about the economy. And so Hispanic voters who were driven off of Trump by his border talk in 2016 were more likely to vote for him in 2020. But that was weird, right. It was the pandemic, in a way, moderating Donald Trump's appeal. 2024 Trump runs, I would say, to the right of where he was on the border in 2016, right. We're talking mass deportations. We're talking more than a wall. And Trump does better among immigrant groups, and he really ever has before. So the Democratic belief that when the topic turned back to immigration, you would see some of that polarization around Trump return and that he would be harmed in immigrant communities did not occur. No inflation probably played some kind of role here, though. The flip side is if you look in the UK, it happened the same year. It's just that the incumbent was right wing instead of left wing. And their labor did also drop with black and Asian and Hindu voters. And so I think that there's some kind of globalized right wing phenomena that's happening. It's hard to know exactly what, but I agree completely. Now just move on to the next slide here we have Harris support by single age year by race and gender. I found this chart a little hard to read. So can you describe to me what's happening here. Sure so we have four lines on this chart. And the x-axis is age. And the axis is our estimate. For what fraction of people in that group voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. And we have a light blue line for women of color. We have a dark blue dashed line for men of color. We have a light pink solid line for white women, and then a dashed line for white men. And one of the things you can see here is if you just look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old women of color are the only of the four that actually voted that Harris won. Trump narrowly won nonwhite men. So I do find this part of this chart shocking it. I sometimes talk about narrative violations. And I think if we knew anything about Donald Trump eight years ago. It's at young people did not like him. And Republicans are maybe throwing away young people for generations in order to run up their margins among seniors. But if you look at this chart among white men who were 75 years old supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than white men who were 20 years old. That's exactly right. That's a real shift. It is a real shift. This is the thing I am the most shocked by. I think in the last four years, is that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the baby boomers, and maybe in some ways more so to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we've experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years. And so the next chart, just to describe it, this chart in some ways convinced me to do this podcast. Oh Thank you. This chart shocks me. I agree, this is to me the scariest chart in this entire presentation. And again, something I'm very surprised by. In the bottom, we have age, and at the top, we have the gender gap in support between women and men and for support for Kamala Harris. And so what you can see is that for voters over 30, the gender gap was fairly stable at around 10 percent which is roughly where it's been in American politics. For voters over 75, it's even lower. That's right. Fairly low gender gap among older voters. Yeah, I think that a lot of people underestimate how recent the gender gap is. Historically, Republicans did better with women than men. And this was true across most of the West that center left parties did better with men than women. And that's changed in the United States in the Clinton era. But it's been stable since then. But what's crazy is if you look at people who are under the age of 30, the gender gap has exploded. If you look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics. Is that abortion. I think it's too early to say exactly what the cause is. What's interesting is that this is happening in other countries as well. Obviously, different countries have different political systems, but I've seen similar patterns in Canada, in the UK, in Norway, there's a lot of research to do here. But it's still very striking. A lot of people talk about the Democratic young men problem, and I think it's still somehow underrated because the actual numbers are just a lot worse than people think. The huge gender gap implies to me, it's not just inflation. Women pay high prices for eggs, too. And I'll say, if you look at the UK election last year, the Labour Party did a lot better because the incumbent party was unpopular. But I think what's interesting is that if you look at it by age, the conservatives actually increased their vote share among 18 to 24-year-old voters, I think by 2 percent or 3 percent even though they only did even though they did 8 percent or 9 percent worse overall. And so I do think it's not just inflation. It's not just backlash to the incumbent governments, though I'm sure that's part of the story, too. I feel like the story you're implying that you believe here is that this is polarization among young men and women, driven by men who are in high school, who are young, who are online, practically online during COVID as MeToo is cresting at the time of as Jordan Peterson is a big figure. Andrew Tate is rising. UVA now gets called the manosphere. But there is a sense the Democratic Party is becoming much more pro-women party. And in some ways anti young men and that just had a huge effect on young men's political opinions. Well, I do want to just stress that this seems to be a global phenomena. And I don't want to over center the particular things the Democratic Party has done rather than the broader cultural. Peterson and Tate are global figures. No, exactly. I agree with that. What I'll say is I just think that we're in the midst of a big cultural change, that I think that people are really underestimating. If you look at Zoomers, I don't have slides on this, but there's just a lot of really interesting ways that they're very different in the data. They're much more likely than previous generations to say that making money is extremely important to them. They are a lot more. If you look at their psychographic data, they have a lot higher levels of psychometric, neuroticism and anxiety than the people before them. If I was going to speculate I think that phones and social media have a lot to do with this. I think it's very plausible to me. And I've heard people describe that these kids grew up looking at social media influencers as role models. But all I can say is that I think that young people today seem to have fairly different values than they did 10 years ago. How that translates into partisan politics depends on what the parties do, but I think it's a big shift. It seems plausible to me that social media, online culture are splitting the media that young men and women get that if you are young and online and a 23-year-old man who is interested in UFC, you're being driven into a very intensely male online world. Whereas if you are 23 years old and female and you are interested in things that the YouTube algorithm codes, that way you are not entering that world. You're actually entering the opposite world. You're seeing brené Brown, right. You're seeing these other things. The capacity to be in highly gendered media worlds is really different in 2024 than it was in 2004, and that's true worldwide. Yeah, I agree with that entirely. Online communities are way more gender segregated than offline communities are. And so in that respect, it should be unsurprising that suddenly shifting a bunch of young people's social worlds to be entirely online all at once cause the political situation to change. So Democrats are getting destroyed now among young voters. That's right. I do think there was. Even as the idea of the rising demographic Democratic majority had become a little discredited in 2016 and 2020. I do think Democrats believed that these young voters were eventually going to save them, that this was a last gasp of something that if Donald Trump couldn't run these numbers up among seniors. And you had millennials really coming into their voting power, Gen Z coming in. That was going to be the end of this Republican Party. And that just completely false. Yeah, I mean, it might be the beginning of this Republican Party. I have to admit, I was one of those liberals four years ago. And it seems like I was wrong. The future has a way of surprising us. The flip side of this is that Democrats made a bunch of gains among older voters, and I'm sure that they'll be happy that they did two years from now, two years from now in the midterms. But if we don't do anything about this, then this problem could become very bad. So right here, I have this slide. This is very simple. This is just showing exit poll favorability for the Democratic and Republican presidential candidate in 2020 and 2024. And I think it's just really important to ground any discussion of the election with the simple fact that Donald Trump was just as unpopular on election day last year as he was in 2020 and maybe even a little bit more unpopular. But what changed is that Biden had a net favorability rating of plus 6, and Harris had a net favorability rating of minus 6. So I want to play Mike Donilon, who was chief strategist to Joe Biden, was recently at a forum, and he made an argument that I think you at least could read this chart as backing up, which is that Biden was more popular in 2020 than Harris was in 2024. Maybe the Biden Harris switch was a mistake. Here's Donilon. Look, I think folks who had this view believe that Biden was going to lose. He didn't have it anymore. He had to get out. That was the best thing for the party. I understand that's their view. But, I have a view too, right. In my view, is that really I think it was insane. I think the party lost its mind. Did the party lose its mind. And that's why we see this chart. I think the best explanation for why Kamala Harris was unpopular is in this next slide, which is just that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular for most of its term. They saw their approval fall off a cliff after Afghanistan, and then it dropped further as inflation and immigration and the budget fights all happen in the fall. And then it never recovered. And I think the big challenge that Kamala Harris faced was just that she was seen as too close, to the Biden administration, which most voters considered to be a failure. And so, I mean, you can never tell. You can never tell a counterfactual world, but I think that Biden would have had an even harder time distinguishing himself from his record. Yeah, it would be even harder for Joe Biden to run away from Joe Biden, I guess. Yeah, looking at this chart, it looks like by January a plus 20 net disapproval. Maybe that was a little bit smaller in November, but it had been widening. I mean, you go back to the beginning of 2023, it was narrower. People were really pissed at the Biden administration, by the time we hit the election. Yeah, I think that the big salient fact about this election. And, I don't think it was impossible for Kamala to do better. This was a winnable election. At the end of the day, it was very close. But this was the big thing, that was weighing Democrats down. And so I just want to move forward, just in terms of why, in our polling, the way that we measure issue importance is we show people two random issues and we just ask which of these problems is more important to the problems facing the country today. And people pick. And when you model it out, whenever you have cost of living or inflation put up against something else, eight or 9 out of 10 people picked that cost of living and inflation was more important. And so I think this just really shows how dominant this was. Voters were really angry about the Biden administration's handling of inflation, of the budget deficit of crime of immigration. And I think that was just a hard thing to escape. Well, you just ticked off a bunch of issues. But what's interesting to me about this particular bit of data is it shows that cost of living and inflation beat almost anything you put in front of it, so I agree. What I find notable here I mean Yeah, cost of living was bigger than student debt fare, but you tested it against immigration and border security and the share of voters saying cost of living or inflation was more important was about 70 percent That's right you tested it against abortion. Their cost of living or inflation was more important to about 80 percent of voters against environment and climate change. 84 percent of voters picked cost of living inflation. One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. I mean, this was something that I was told by top Biden strategists going way back. I don't see democracy on here. January 6. The stability of the system. Did you test that, too. No we did. And later we have a slide on. I mean, I'm just going to scroll down to it now since you brought it up. But we did a survey where we just asked people, what's more important right now preserving America's institutions or delivering change that improves people's lives. And it was 78 to 18. Delivering change that improves people's lives. And I'm just going to scroll up. But I think what's really hard, I think this has been one of the hardest things about being a political consultant in the last eight years is that every day, Trump does terrible things that I think are objectively awful and scary, and it piss me off. I'm going to prosecute my enemies or whatever. And then we do a bunch of tests and voters really don't want to hear about it. From us, I think that Trump would do better if he didn't do that stuff. For sure. But I think that voters want us to talk about concrete ways that they're going to improve people's lives. There is an argument you hear from many Democrats. There was no problem here except for inflation, that, in fact, if you compare Democratic vote outcomes with incumbent parties in many other countries, Democrats did better than incumbent parties in other countries did. So you look at the conservatives in the UK, they had a much worse election result. You look at what happened to the ruling coalition in France. In some ways Democrats were doing fine. They had a fairly modest drop in support. And it's just a shame for them that inflation happened on their watch, that if Donald Trump had won the 2020 election, inflation would have happened on his watch, completely discrediting him and his administration. And that would have been the end of them. How do you distinguish between. There is a broad structural problem the Democratic Party is facing that it needs to think about for 2028, and there's actually no problem here. But I think I just want to go over to the next slide. When we measure issues, we measure how important voters find it. And that's what we have in the bottom here. And then we just measure. Do you trust Democrats or Republicans more on this issue. And what you see here is if you look at the top issues that voters care the most about cost of living, the economy, taxes and government spending the deficit, foreign policy, health other than health, where Democrats have a narrow lead, Republicans have massive trust advantages 15 points on all of the issues that voters care the most about. And so the story that I would tell in response to your question is that in this election, voters trusted Republicans way more than Democrats on all of the most important issues, but also bought into this idea that Donald Trump was a terrible person who couldn't be trusted with power. And that made the election be close. But four years from now, Donald Trump will not be the nominee, and maybe they'll nominate somebody who's just as terrible and just as unlikable. But if we don't, get out of this trust deficit, I think that we'll have a lot of problems for people listening along. This is a chart broken into quadrants. That's right. And the top right quadrant is issues that are very important and issues where Democrats are more trusted. And it's an untilled bit of farmland up there. That's right. So there's mental health, which voters don't rate that important, but they do trust Democrats quite a bit more. They rate it higher than they rate, though. Climate change and the environment and abortion, which struck me as surprising. Mental health seems like a much bigger deal on this then you typically then I think politics reflects on either side right there. One bright spot is really health care. That's right. That's kind of it in terms of issues where it is quite important and they have a genuinely noticeable advantage. Yeah, I think it's just worth saying that four years ago the number one issue was COVID and health care. And those also were the issues that people trusted Democrats the most on. And so the strategy was really obvious. Just talk a lot about COVID and health care. But this time we had a much harder problem, which was that the issues that people cared the most about for the most part, voters didn't trust us on and the issues that people did trust us on climate change, and reproductive rights, probably the big ones voters just didn't care very much about. And so that was just a very difficult strategic position. And it's also one that was just very different than it was four years ago. All right. I just want to tick off some issues voters ranked as important that they trusted Republicans on and then ask you a question about it. So they thought. Cost of living, the economy and inflation were very important. Had a lot more trust in Republicans. They thought national security and foreign policy were important. Trusted Republicans, taxes. Government spending. Government debt. Trusted Republicans. Crime immigration. Trusted Republicans. Social Security. Trusted Republicans. That seems like a bad one for Democrats, a political division they thought was important. They trusted Republicans. A bit more on that in this data. If I looked over time, if I looked at 2016 and I looked at 2020, would I see on all of these that Republicans had advantages and Democrats were just winning on health care. How much of this is something flipping around as an incumbent penalty and reaction to conditions in the country at that moment, and how much of it is a durable situation where Republicans have a trust advantage, where Democrats would have to act in a spectacular way over time to change voters impressions of them on that issue. What we saw in our data was that as the Biden administration became a lot more unpopular all of these things dropped a lot. So some of it was uniform shift. But I think that the last four years, there were some things that structurally changed a lot in every center left party in the world. Generally the left has its issues that it owns and the right has its issues that it owns. But usually the economy is pretty neutral. During the Trump administration, the economy was fairly neutral. And in 2020, I think if you looked at this and even in 2021, it really didn't look anything like this. Another really big shift was just that education has gone from being basically one of the best issues for Democrats to being something that's basically neutral now. And we saw that in the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, we even saw it be an advantage for Republicans. And then the other big shift in the other side was that reproductive rights used to be a fairly neutral issue for Democrats like in general. When you talked about it in the pre Dobbs era, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that changed a lot of oats. And immediately after Dobbs, we saw a party trust on reproductive rights shoot up. And so I think these numbers they do change. And this is one of the big messages I want to get through is just that, the world has changed a lot in the last four years. It's going to keep changing. And we have to adjust in response to what happens. All right. So this tell me what's going on in this next slide. Because I also, as I understand this is really very connected to the work you do specifically. So what are you doing here. All right. So one of the big things that my firm does, it's probably our biggest product is that we do randomized controlled trials on ads. This is something that both parties do. This is pretty standard. But the idea is that for a given ad, you take 1,000 people split them into a treatment and control group. 500 people see the ad, 500 people don't. And then you survey them after. And you see, ask them who they're voting for. And then the difference between treatment and control can be described as the causal effect of if you see this ad, this is the effect it will have on your chance of voting for them. And so we tested on the order of I'd say probably like four or $5,000 Harris ads last cycle. And I just wanted to call out these two ads that were in the top 1 percent of ads that we tested. One is from Kamala Harris. I get it. The cost of rent, groceries and utilities is too high. So here's what we're going to do about it. We will lower housing costs by building more homes and crack down on landlords who are charging too much. We will lower your food and grocery bills by going after price gougers who are keeping the cost of everyday goods too high. I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message because you work hard for your paycheck, you should get to keep more of it. As president, I'll make that my top priority. Obviously, there's a lot for several parts of the Democratic coalition there. Another ad by future forward shows attacks him for a national sales tax for the idea that Trump's tax him being Trump. Yeah attacks Trump. He fights for himself and his billionaire friends. He intends to enact a national sales tax. The Trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by $4,000 a year. Instead of a tax hike, we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. As attack is responsible for the content of this ad, these were obviously the best ads in the campaign. And the point, I just want to say is, I think this reinforces the point that what voters cared the most about was the cost of living, and that voters were really mad about the actual situation. And I think that Harris being able to in this ad acknowledging oh, things are actually very bad. I don't like this. I have a plan to fix. This is part of what made it so effective. There is a view out there. I saw Jacobin had just done some research on this, which is a socialist publication that at the beginning of the Harris campaign, sprint, I mean, she was only the head of the Democratic ticket for three months. She was talking a lot about the economy and that by the end, she was talking a lot about democracy, that there had been a change in the nature of the campaign, the ads it was running, how they were messaging. Their big closing argument was that the ellipses in Washington, DC, which is where the January 6 riots, in a way, began that there was phases of the Harris campaign, and the first one was more populist and the last one was more institutional. From what you saw, was that true. I think that there was this big strategic question that Democrats faced. And it wasn't just the Harris campaign, which is polling would tell them you should talk about the economy, or voters care a lot about the cost of living. But it's very hard, one to get media attention on those things. And two, I think that Trump has done a good job of baiting us. I think what's really interesting about a lot of the democracy and authoritarian stuff is just that how concerned you are by it really varies a lot by political engagement and by education and the kind of people who set media decisions at CNN or who work in politics are the kinds of people who are going to be much more concerned about it, than working class folks are. And so I think that but but look, there is a difference between the Harris campaign was running the optimal David Shor strategy in late October of 2024, and they were not. The Harris campaign had access future before it had access to all of this issue by issue polling. They had access to all this randomized ad testing. Did they run a heavily economic campaign and it didn't work, or did they not run a heavily economic campaign at the end. And it didn't work, because, look, if they did the thing and it didn't work, then maybe it just didn't work. Did they not do it. Yeah, I mean, asking the hard questions. But yeah, I think obviously, I think that Democratic messaging last cycle was not economically focused enough. I think that it focused too much on narratives of defending institutions, defending democracy. And I think it's just very easy, for folks to fall into that trap. But I really don't. But why. If they did that and I heard this from different people. David Plouffe is a smart guy. I'm not telling you to. I'm not asking you to critique David Plouffe. I can watch you getting physically uncomfortable as I. As I harm your business here. right, right. But these people all wanted to win. They really did. Every single one of them. And they had a lot of data. So I think this has been a thing on my mind. If they weren't running the optimal strategy, why. I know it's hard to get media attention for things, and that's fair enough. But it's also not impossible to get media attention for things right. For instance, it's very easy to get media attention for anti-price gouging policies because there's a lot of controversy over them about whether or not they worked. But they did make people talk about whether or not you were going to do an anti-price gouging policy. This is a Donald Trump move, constantly announce a policy that probably doesn't work, or is in some way outrageous or beyond the bounds of political possibility, maybe isn't even all that popular when you poll, but you get people talking about you having a very strong view. You're going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Everybody knows Mexico isn't going to pay for it. But you are talking about how Donald Trump hates immigration. And it breaks through. It is not rocket science to get people to pay attention. If Bernie Sanders had been running in the campaign, people would have paid attention to his economic messaging because he does economic messaging that creates conflict. If it was really this big delta between the economic push and the institutions push, and the institutions push is what got made, or at least got made more than 1, it should have. Why the thing I'll say, in terms of why I'm sympathetic to the people who actually had these jobs and had to make these decisions, is it just feels wrong. I have a situation, I mentioned this before where donors will email me and they'll be like Oh, look at this crazy, absolutely terrible thing, this evil thing that Trump is doing. We need to test it. We need to tell the voters, can you test it. And it really doesn't work. People want to hear about eggs. And it's easy for me to say that, because I don't really I'm not directly in charge. But I just think it just feels really wrong when you're in the moment. It's just it's very hard to totally shift direction, just because data tells you one thing. I do think the campaign photo ops that we all remember at the end are telling, which is it was an extraordinary visual. Harris at the Ellipse. And then there were the visuals of Donald Trump in a garbage truck and Donald Trump at McDonald's. And there was a Ridiculousness to those visuals. I saw a lot of liberals making fun of them on various social media platforms, but there was something about which visuals are being chosen by the two candidates. I mean, of the two of them, only Kamala Harris had actually worked at a McDonald's. Sure, but she wasn't the one who ended up like putting on the apron and getting photographed at McDonald's. And there's a thing about what the candidates end up wanting to do that is meaningful to. And I do think there's a way in which I wonder if that explains part of what we ended up seeing. Each coalitions campaigns are ultimately going to reflect the aesthetic and cultural choices of the people who staff them. And, it makes sense. If you had just said two years ago, Trump's going to end by showing up at a McDonald's. Like, it just wouldn't have been surprising, I think. And so it's just hard to escape, that kind of demographic pull. But we have to try because we have to actually win these people over. And so now I just have I have a couple more slides I want to go through. I talked about this before, but voters cared a lot more about delivering change than preserving institutions. And then we have this other polling question here, which I think is interesting, which is just asking people to pick between the statements. Things could be going better in America, but what we need is a return to basic stability. And the other is things in America are going poorly, and what's needed is a major change and a shock to the system. And when you have those two things, it's 53, 37, which is a lot wider than the election result ended up being. What really strikes me about this is that sometimes I read polls, and the wording is pretty clearly there to make something sound better than the other thing. Things could be going better in America, and what is needed is return to basic stability from whoever becomes president. And things in America are going poorly, and what is needed is a major change and a shock to the system from whoever becomes president. I would in some ways say the second there is worded to turn people off a little bit, it sounds disruptive crisis, a shock. It's not just major change. It is something beyond that. And it dominates, I guess, though, I have a question about this, which is on the one hand, we see lines like that outpolling the incremental change everywhere. On the other hand, if you look at the New split ticket ratings for who overperformed in the election. Very moderate. House Democrats did very well. Totally there does seem to me to be a tension between two forms of political wisdom that both have data behind them right now. Which is that voters want huge, massive change. And the optimal political strategy is Joe Manchin or Jared Golden or Ruben Gallego, who are actually not. Or Susan Collins, who are not people who promise unbelievably shocking change. They are moderates who kind of tack between the parties a little bit and try to represent a center that wants something a little bit less dramatic than either side is offering. How do you reconcile them. There's an enormous amount of status quo bias in politics. Campaigning on big policy changes can be pretty unpopular. But I think the way to thread the needle, what this is really saying is that voters were very angry about the state of things, and what they wanted tonally was someone who acknowledged that anger because Ruben and Gallego did a lot of criticism of the status quo and was able to outperform. So people on an angry moderate. That's right. I think that's exactly right. Like they want not AI always think of temperament and ideology as being separate axes in American politics that we connect too much. So we think about people who are moderates often have the moderate temperament. Susan Collins is like the great example, the joke always of the Susan Collins meter from somewhat concerned all the way to very concerned being the red line for her. You have a lot of moderates who by nature they're pretty chill. They try to be civil. What this is implying is what people want are moderate policies in a more revolutionary or certainly more upset temperament. Yeah, we're pissed, but not ideologically extreme about it. It's like a funny chant. But when people think about moderates, they think of somebody like Joe Manchin, someone who's just like down the line on everything. And the reality. I think that an accurate description of what highly educated moderates are like. But most low socioeconomic status moderates actually have fairly incoherent views. They're liberal on some issues. They're very conservative on other issues. And I think that that's just like a much closer fit. For And that's when you think of that, it's maybe less surprising that a lot of them Donald Trump back in 2016, I wrote a piece about Donald Trump that has one of these headlines that now people will sometimes screenshot and be mad at me about but it's called something like Donald Trump is a perfect moderate. And the point of the piece was not that he's not extreme, because I think he is extreme, but that the way his politics worked, practically on the campaign trail in things he said, was that it was internally disorganized, so he'd be extremely far right on immigration. But compared to other Republicans, much more centrist on things like Medicare and Social Security. He would talk about giving health care to everybody, even though Republicans wouldn't like that. He talked about raising taxes on people like him, not how he governed. But there's a lot of research that actual moderates, people in the elected who are moderate. It's not that they have in between the two parties view on everything, it's that they might believe in completely legalized weed, on the one hand, and mass deportations on the other, that it's like if you imagine positions as being they can be very liberal or very conservative. They average out to moderate as opposed to being consistently moderate. That's exactly right. And the way I like to put that in math terms, the issue correlations for highly educated people are just a lot higher than they are. Your eyebrows get excited when you do math terms. Yeah no. I'm sorry. It's all right. But I'm glad we started talking about ideology because that dovetails to the next slide. Here we just ask for each of the candidates. Do you think this candidate was more liberal than me, more conservative than me, or close to my views. So when you look at this slide, what you see is that 49 percent of voters said that Kamala Harris was more liberal than me, while only 39 percent of voters said that Donald Trump was more conservative than me. And so there was this big ideological perception gap where a lot of voters saw Donald Trump as more as more moderate than Kamala Harris. What did this look like in 2016 and 2020? So in 2016, it looked fairly similar to this. In 2020, perceptions of Donald Trump being too extreme went up relative to 2016, and perceptions of the Democratic candidate being too extreme went down from 2016 to 2020. Now that I think wasn't a property of Joe Biden per se. Like, him being moderate was a big part of his brand at that time. But in our polling, we would ask, do you think that Joe Biden is too liberal or too conservative or whatever. And we saw that over the course of 2021, as his approval ratings dipped, the perception that he was too liberal also went up. Well, it's also true that Joe Biden became more liberal like in terms of how he governed and in terms of what he ran on. So you're saying that in the 2020 election, you actually did see people say that they were ideologically closer to Biden than to Trump. Yes And then over time, that eroded, that eroded. The thing I want to say here before I move on is I'm really not trying to beat up on Kamala Harris here. I think if you just step back, if you have a situation where the Democratic Party, where only 42 percent of Americans trust the Democratic Party on the economy relative to 58 for Republicans. Obviously, the standard bearer of the Democratic Party is going to be perceived as too left wing unless they unless they do a lot of stuff to try to counterbalance that. I mean, people were living under the biden-harris administration, whatever they thought of it. The line Trump would sometimes deliver on Harris, which in many ways is unfair if you're a super politically engaged voter and you have a lot of thoughts about the powers of the vice presidency. But to most people, if you have all these great ideas, why don't you do them. In the last four years, while your vice president was a pretty strong argument. I think there's a good argument that given that, it's amazing that we did as well as we did. But it was a close election. And so who knows what the counterfactual could have been. I want to note something as a dog that is not barking across this presentation. Yeah since the election, I think that if you look at what Donald Trump is doing, what Elon Musk is doing, and if you look at punditry about the election, that if everybody agrees on anything, it's that the election was a huge verdict on wokeness. Famously, one of Trump's higher testing ads was this Kamala Harris is her they/them Donald Trump is for you as you're running through this. I'm not saying you're saying DEI programs are popular, but I'm not seeing it emerge as a major explanation for 2024 here. I'm curious how you both think about it in the election and think about the role that's playing in the post-election narrative. I just want to say, they/them ad that everybody talks about it was a good ad, but it was like a 70th percentile ad. In our testing, if you look at all of the best testing ads from Donald Trump, it was basically the economy. It was gas prices, it was immigration, it was crime. And so I think that there's definitely been an overfocus on die, on wokeness, on trans issues. I think it definitely played a role on the elite discourse and why so many tech CEOs have become more right wing. And all of that. But I think that the voters were really mad about inflation and crime and immigration and the budget deficit. And I think the Republicans are making a mistake, honestly, to focus on these things. So much relative to concrete issues that people actually care about. I think that there's this bigger picture point I want to make where I think that a lot of people see the Trump administration as kind of a break that shows that all of the traditional rules of politics, no longer apply. And I think to some extent that's wrong, that a lot of what's happening is really very easy to understand. Donald Trump, to go back to the ideological thing he broke with his party. He might have been dishonest about it, but he disavowed Project 2025. He said that he wouldn't cut Social programs, he ruled out a national abortion ban. And I think that kind of thing just plays a big role in his success. And I think that a lot of these newer things that we talk about might be less important than we think. But the flip side is it's possible that when it comes to something like, why is it that 20-year-old men are so much more conservative than they were four years ago. I could believe maybe wokeness has something to do with that, but I think that the bulk of this is traditional factors. So now I just have the last slide of the retrospective. What I have here is we have the share of voters who get their news from TikTok by year, the share of voters who get their news of young voters, who get their news from TikTok more than quadrupled in the last four years. This is the biggest and probably fastest change in media consumption. That has happened in my lifetime and it was quite correlated with support change. Now, obviously TikTok users are younger, they're less politically engaged. It's not surprising that we dropped among this group. You'd expect that from demographics. But if you go and you do the regressions, I think there was definitely a causal element there. And when you Zoom in, particularly to people who get their news from TikTok who don't care very much about politics, this is a group that's eight percentage points more Republican than they were four years ago. And that's a lot. So by the end of the election, Donald Trump is promising to save TikTok. One possible explanation, then, for TikTok users shifting towards Trump is that they like TikTok, and they didn't want it to be taken away from them. Another, which people have worried about quite a bit, is that the company behind TikTok could very easily have been turning dials just softly. It's not that nothing that is liberal does well on TikTok. I've seen videos of me get posted there and do very well on TikTok, but that it would not be hard to turn up the dial a little bit on issues that are tricky for Democrats. On people complaining about the cost of living on pro-trump influencers. If everybody who the algorithm codes is, pro-trump gets a 7 percent boost. That is pretty that will not be obvious exactly on the app, but could be very, very meaningful in the aggregate when you look at this data. Do you think it is something about TikTok. Do you think it is something about TikTok's audience just being young people who are seeing this movement. Or does it make you suspect dial turning. I don't know the answer to that. It's totally possible. Like, we know that they do. Dial turning on some topics, stuff like Ukraine or Tiananmen Square or whatever. But what I'll say is, I think that TikTok represents something fairly radically different than social networks that came before it. And I'm sure you know that there could be some malfeasance on the part of people who work there. But the thing that I think about sometimes is just that. I think TikTok is really the first social media platform that is really, truly decentralized. Like if you. And what I mean by that is just it's not based on follower graphs. Like if you look at reels or Twitter or whatever, how many people see a video or a piece of content is highly correlated with how many followers that person has. TikTok's a lot more random, and there's very interesting machine learning reasons for why but I think that it really allowed a lot of content that never would have gotten a lot of views on Twitter or on television to suddenly escape containment and get directly into the eyes of people who don't care that much about politics. And, I don't could tell a story that maybe just anti-incumbent stuff is going to do really well on TikTok and Democrats are going to do great. Now, I don't really know. But I think that for whatever reason, this big change I think really did help Republicans. And it's just an example of how the world has really changed a lot. So I know that you're near Democratic both freak out and funding world. I hear a lot from Democrats about how to fix what they now call their media problem. Or sometimes you hear the TikTok problem, maybe pay try to seed creators and give them some support. When you look at this, do you think this is something that an established political party and a bunch of donors can do something about. Or do you think this is a TikTok is a vibes machine. And basically for reasons of inflation, for reasons of incumbency, for reasons of censorious Democratic Party that people got tired of the vibes are bad for Democrats in 2024, and vibes machines like TikTok some of the other social media things, they're going to be an amplifier of bad vibes. So it's not really a thing to do in the sense of strategy. What you're trying to do is be culturally, both in terms of the candidates you have and the actual things you say and believe. Culturally a better product, and then the things that pick up good cultural products and amplify them are going to be friendlier to you. I think there's a lot of truth in that. I think that TikTok is genuinely strange relative to platforms before it, in that its audience is more politically disengaged and more working class, and I think it's just been very hard for us as a party to find creators and content that appeals to people like that because all of the people who work in Democratic politics are not like that. And I think that in the old traditional media world, we were a lot like the media gatekeepers. And so it was kind of clear how to win that war. And I think Democrats did a good job of doing it. But now we have a totally different fight. So just to move on and talk a little bit about the present as opposed to the long, long time ago of four or five months ago. So, you've talked a lot in your previous episodes about Trump's flood the zone strategy, where he's just constantly doing a bunch of stuff. And what we've done here is we've pulled all his executive orders and stuff that he's campaigned on. I think we have something like 60, 60 dots here. Every one of these dots is a policy that we've pulled. And what you can see is that there's a lot of variance. A lot of the things that he campaigned on no taxes on tips, deploying the military to the border. Voter ID laws, ending remote work for federal employees. A lot of that stuff is very popular. While the flip side is a lot of stuff that he's actually doing. He talks about this stuff less, but Medicaid cuts, repealing the Aca, extending tax cuts to billionaires, a lot of that stuff is really unpopular. Just to say something a little controversial. I think a lot of the challenge of the Trump era is that they're going to try to bait us we should do everything we can to actually meaningfully resist and protect populations that we care about and everything. But I think we need to make sure that we're preserving a considerable amount of time, to attacking Trump on the most effective things that voters are concerned about. You used the term bait a few times. Yeah they're going to try to bait us. I think of a political party baiting you as dangling something in front of you that they know is going to make you mad, but it isn't that big of a deal. They're doing mass firings around critical functions. They're destroying USAID. They're aggregating huge amount of executive power. The set of things that I find Democrats are really worried about at the moment. It's on the one hand, I suspect they're not the things that the public cares about wants to hear that much about making a podcast or the deputy director of the FBI. But at the same time, they're not baiting. They're real. They're important. Like what is the point of a party that will not fight those. And this is a place where I think there is a tension between this focus on what's popular. Don't focus on just the things that activate your high education, high income base. But in terms of getting people out into the streets, potentially, if you need that, getting people to town halls, there's sometimes I think this thought of the party is just going to I mean, James carville's been saying Democrats should basically play dead for a while and wait until the Trump administration's unpopular actions destroy the Trump administration, but don't get in the way. Or there's this version of a party that various things Hakeem Jeffries has said at different points have sounded like this to people, I think is thinking is a little bit more complicated than this. But we're not going to run after all these things. We're going to focus on the price of eggs, the price of goods. You can really lose your own base if you're not defending democracy. When they care about democracy because you're waiting for an opportunity to attack prices, when prices are going to do what prices are going to do. What Democrats say about prices isn't the most salient thing. Am I getting what you're saying right. Is there a way of threading the needle. How do you think about that. Yeah, I think you could imagine a theoretical world where we would have really hard and unpleasant trade offs. But I think the world we actually live in is that a bunch of the things that we're extremely concerned about are actually really unpopular. And just kind of going forward to the next slide. Here's some randomized control trial data that we did that I was talking about earlier with the ads, where we just kind of went through. And we looked at 58 different things that Trump's going to do. And then we rank ordered them by how persuasive they were at actually changing people's votes and making people disapprove of Trump. And I think that a lot of the things that we're most concerned about Ellen, causing chaos in the federal government cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security, extending tax breaks for the rich. I obviously this list of things is not exactly the same as my top five things that I am personally most concerned about with the Trump administration. But I think that the Republicans are making a lot of unforced errors that make it easier to thread the needle on these things than I think it otherwise would be true. But these are also pretty small changes in Trump disapproval if I'm reading what this chart is. If Democrats attack Trump for cutting Medicare and Social Security or wanting to cut Medicare and Social Security, that increases Trump disapproval by 2.5 points. If they attack him for letting Ellen budgets, hurting Americans and putting privacy at risk, that hurts him by 2.2 points. Going down. Passing a one party power grab to cut government services without compromise. That's 2.1 points. These kind of all look the same, and none of them are very big. Can you just like, think for a second like this is like, can you imagine 70 words you like, stop a Trump voter on the street and you say the 70 words to him, and then there's a 2.2 5 percent chance he changed his mind. I think that's incredible. I just think that these two pieces of data tell a story of how we should try to shape the campaign against Trump in the next couple of months, which is that he is wrecking havoc in the federal government. I think that is consistent with our principles and also something that voters are very concerned about. That he is trying to support for the safety net and that he's trying to do tax cuts against the wealthy. And I think that a lot of this critique of Trump is really very similar to the campaign that we ran against Mitt Romney. And I think that this kind of gets back to what I was saying before of I feel like, we were so shocked by Trump that we kind of forgot that the old rules of politics. I want to read two of these because I think something you just said is important when we're talking about these old laws of politics. So here, here's these are all high polling, high testing messages. But this is the lowest one on the chart. So Trump is working to repeal a law that lowers the cost of health and prescription drug costs and caps insulin costs at 35 a month for seniors. By repealing this law, Trump will increase the cost of life saving medicine for millions and create more financial strain when costs are already too high. So that increases Trump disapproval by 1.9 points. I think that is as right down the middle, a Democratic message as you could possibly imagine that does not test as well as Trump is letting Elon Musk federal budgets with no oversight, checks or balances. Musk gave $250 million to Trump's campaign, and now Trump is letting Musk reshape the government in ways that advance Musk's interests, even if they hurt working Americans by cutting the basics like Medicaid and public schools. I am actually surprised that the Elon Musk is out attack is outpolling the insulin attack. And it's interesting because I see this in Trump voters in my own life right there. Some of the ones I they're actually not happy with what's going on in the Trump administration. There's a lot they don't like. There's a lot going on, but too much. But Musk creeps them out. Is that in your data. I think it's really telling that Elon stuff floats to the top here because it's really very hard for something to be competitive with, protect Social Security and Medicare. The fact that there are multiple Elon things up at the top, I think, really does tell a story that there's something really unusual about what he's doing. It's very easy to tie what he's doing to harming individual people. In ads, one of the clearest patterns in ads is that getting a real person and just having them stare at a camera and talk about the ways that Republicans have personally hurt them, it's the best content. It's funny, if you hire actors, it doesn't work as well. People have tried. And that's why in some ways, I'm optimistic that Democrats will be able to thread the coalitional needle here because we should like the two things that we should do is fight against social welfare cuts and also attack Elon Musk for the chaos he's creating. And I think that that's something that basically every wing of the party should be on board with. Donald Trump is polling better than he was at this point in his first term. And the vibes have really shifted in pro-trump direction. And look at how much he and Elon Musk are doing. And, I've certainly talked to Republicans who have this feeling that Trump has unlocked a political juggernaut here, that he has cracked the code of American politics. But you have this. This slide is titled Trump is vulnerable. So why is he vulnerable. Well the first thing you see is that he has been getting more unpopular rapidly as time has gone on. And I just think the most predictable thing in American politics, and we get surprised every single time it happens is the president comes in, he wins a trifecta, and then he does a bunch of unpopular stuff. He overreaches, and then he becomes very unpopular and loses big in the midterms. That doesn't mean that you can't avoid the cycle. But I think that in order to avoid it, when you look at the people who did the best job, Clinton in 1998 or Kennedy in 1962 they did it by engaging in an enormous amount of policy restraint. And that is just not what Trump has been doing at all. And I think that you can just see in the data. But his approval rating is dropping pretty quickly, and you can see that he's just pissing off lots of people and that the stuff that a lot of the stuff that he's doing and drawing attention toward is really quite unpopular. There's also this reality of the coalitional realignment you were talking about at the beginning, which is Democrats now have this higher information, higher engagement coalition. Those are the people who turn out to midterms disproportionately. If I were a moderate Republican right now or a Republican in any way vulnerable, I know they're all afraid of Elon Musk and they're afraid of primaries. I'd be pretty afraid of losing, because it's not just that you tend to have thermostatic midterm elections, but that the coalitions have been changing such that Democrats are able to survive the 2022 midterm, which should have gone against them. And I think Dobbs saved them to some degree. But also the fact that their coalition was as you showed earlier. If only 20, 22 voters had come out in 2024, Harris would have won. You got to be pretty confident in Donald Trump's political skills to think that he is going to shift that dynamic. It seems that in addition to all the normal things that happens to presidents and midterms, the shape of the coalition makes midterms harder right now for Republicans. Yeah, I think that's exactly right. But that said, it gets to this tension in all of these Democratic soul searching conversations, which is if Democrats do nothing really like, they'll probably be O.K in 2026 because all of these voters, who get their news from TikTok, who don't care about politics, these voters under 25, they just really are not going to vote very much in the midterms. But if we don't fix this problem, then four years from now, we could be in the same trust deficit on all of these core issues. And these voters that didn't turn out in 2026 will come back. And except we'll be running against a candidate who's a lot less unpopular, potentially, than Trump. And we could be in a real problem, a real, real pickle. How about the Senate. So you and I did a big piece on debates about populism a couple years ago, involved a model that you had, and that model was predicting in 2022, but specifically 2024 Democratic Senate annihilation. And Democrats are down a couple of seats in the Senate. It's what is it, 5347 right. It's not a good map for them in 2026. And they did lose some seats that were really important to them tester and Montana and Brown in Ohio. How do you see the Democratic Senate future. If you had told me in 2019, when I started worrying about the 2024 Senate election, that we would have 47 seats, I would have jumped for joining me. I think the really big factors there is they Republicans ran a bunch of really terrible candidates in a bunch of swing races. And it turns out Democrats, those Democratic candidates, did a good job of distancing themselves from the party. I don't want to spend too much time speculating about the 2026 map, but I think that even though the bias in the electoral college has gone down quite a bit because of this swing among immigrants that doesn't really change that. The Senate, it's very hard for Democrats to take the Senate unless they can consistently outperform how Harris did and how Biden did in most of the country. These problems won't be fixed unless we spend the next two years or four years, changing the party's brand among working class voters who are overrepresented in the Senate. The one exception to this, I think and this is just controversial and might get me in trouble is I think that I'm just going to scroll up back to the Senate side. If you look in Nebraska, the single biggest overperformance that we had was Osborne running as an independent. He outperformed at the top of the ticket by 7.1 percent Now obviously, Nebraska is an extremely red state. And I think that we've only ever tried this strategy of running people who are literally formally not tied to the Democratic Party in extremely red states. But I think the argument for doing that kind of thing in an merely red states, in places like Florida or places like Ohio or Iowa. Those are hard questions. And it's not up to me, what we end up doing, but I think it's something that we have to really seriously consider. And then that also just brings up the really awkward point of like, well, what do we do with the reality that in most by land area, in most parts of the country, it's almost impossible for a Democrat or someone with a Democrat on their ticket to win. What do you do about the reality of the Democratic brand is toxic in. Yeah most of the land area in the country, because I think you can have this conversation that you always have to be careful about which conversation you're having is a conversation. Can Democrats win in 2026 or 2028? And the answer there is Yes. If the conversation is how do you get back to a place where you're putting states in play that Democrats have just kind of given up on. Mitch McConnell is retiring in Kentucky. There's a Democratic Governor in Kentucky. It's not literally true that no Democrat can ever win there. I don't think anybody seriously thinks so that a Democrat is going to win Mitch McConnell's seat, because the Democratic brand nationally, which is different than it's kind of state party brand, is pretty bad. And people understand when they're voting for Senate, they're voting for the National brand. So you been thinking about this for a long time. If you were trying to think about reversing these much deeper trends, right. These educational trends, this realignment that has. If your whole point in life was to make Democrats competitive again in Florida, in Missouri, in Kansas. Not the reddest states, but states that they were competitive in a couple of years ago. What would you advise Democrats to do. The reality of the situation right now, I think there are these big theoretical discussions we could have about what positions the Democrats could take. Is that Democrats are not in power right now. And so we don't have agenda control. And I think a lot of this just depends on what Trump does and what. And then who replaces Trump. Something I'll say going back to the 2016 the first time that Trump was president is that when we were looking at polling of non-college whites and these obama-trump voters, their approval rating for Trump was really very stable for most of his term. And the only time that it declined was when Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And then we saw them revert to their old partisanship. But once that was out of the news, they switched back. And so I think that does kind of like at this moment, given that there is no party leader. I think it's mostly a question of if Trump does successfully push a bunch of welfare state cuts, then that might change the realignment. But I think realistically, at least until 2026, it's mostly a function of what Republicans do. But when we pick a new presidential candidate that will be a that will be a reset. And I think I don't think it's too early to talk about that, but I think that could imagine us picking candidates who would do a much better job. I think that is a good place to end. So always our final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience. I'd say the three books for me, I want to call out hollow parties by Danny Salzman. He's a good friend of mine, and I think it's. And Sam rosenfelt and Sam Rosenfeld, of course, my old colleague. Yes I think it's hard to talk about a lot of these questions that I was kind of dodging about why parties were doing what they did without kind of reading that. The other thing I want to call out is something that was hugely influential for how I think about politics is a really nerdy pick, but the origin and nature of mass opinion by Xolair. It gets at this question of how much does what people say in surveys matter versus how much of it is downstream of what people are saying what elites are saying. And I think his answer is mostly elites, but both. And then the last thing I just wanted to call out was a victory lap by Sasha Eisenberg. It kind of talks a lot about the history of the Democratic analytics industry. A lot of the stuff that these numbers that I've shared here come out of that machine. And so if you're just interested in the history of the Democratic party's internal analytics and research structure, it's the only book really that's ever been written about it.

      "text": "Democrats Need to Face Why Trump Won\n\nnew video loaded: Democrats Need to Face Why Trump Won\n\ntranscript\n\nI've been spending some time recently with top Democrats, as they think about how to rebuild after the 2024 loss. And I'll say that in some years I've been covering politics, I have never heard them so confused. America is back. How could they possibly lost this election to this person. Also, how is the Democratic Party weakening. So much among groups whose strength, whose support it once took for granted. Young voters. Non-white voters. Working class voters. What does it mean that the Democratic Party is losing what was once its base, its reliable base. Someone whose analysis on this have come to respect over the years is David Shor. David Shor is the head of data science at blowers research, which is a big Democratic consulting firm. So first, this is a big table of numbers. It does a huge amount of political surveying and interpretation of data and testing of messaging. And he's gotten a lot of things right before other people did, including that educational polarization was becoming the central fault line for American democracy. And so when I saw Shor recently and he began walking me through some of his slides, some of the ways he was interpreting the 2024 election and trying to help people see what had happened. My first thought was this would be worth doing in public, rather than this being a thing that Democrats are debating in Backrooms with each other. What if we did this in public. And so this episode is a bit of an experiment. He's walking me through this presentation and I am interrogating it. But I found this really, really helpful. I don't necessarily have every conclusion, David does, but I think it is a good place to begin. And there's then a lot that can follow from having this conversation. As always, my email at nytimes.com. David Shor, welcome to the show. Excited to be here. So what do you do. And why should I trust the data you're about to show us here. I'm glad. I'm glad you asked. I'm the co-founder of a research firm called blue rose research. We did 26 million interviews last year, and we have a team of about 45 people, machine learning engineers, software engineers from companies like Google. And, we've done a lot of work to try to figure out what actually happened last year. A lot of liberals I feel really burnt by survey data. There's a sense that nobody picks up the phone. How are you surveying these older people if you're doing it online. Putting aside the fact that you conducted a lot of surveys, why are you confident those surveys reflect reality. The fundamental problem with survey research is just that people who answer surveys are really weird. There's two ways that you can try to fix that. One is that you could try to get a normal representative set of people. That's just impossible in today's day and age. And the other is that you can just try to collect a lot of information so that you can adjust for how weird they are. The reason I feel fairly confident about this is just in our work, every time we make any change to any part of our system, we go back and back, test and see how it affects accuracy across every other election that we've ever surveyed. We can't be fully confident about any particular thing that we say. A lot of the data isn't back yet, but I think that there's enough data to tell a coherent story. There's the 26 million survey respondents of 8 million unique people. There's precinct and County level election results. We're also going to try to tie together all of the external data that other people have done. And what I'll say about this election is that our forecast. This cycle were very accurate. Our overall error was about 1/3 of a percent nationally. And I think that a lot most of the things that we thought would happen. Did bear out. And I do want to spend a second to answer, something that you had asked a second ago, which is just like, why look at survey data. I think that Super politically engaged people are overrepresented at every single step of the political process. They're more likely to run for office. They're more likely to work in campaigns and journalism. They're more likely to listen to podcasts like this one. And I think that they're really the only point other than election day, when regular people get a say is in polls. And so I think there isn't really any Democratic alternative to trying to listen to the people and hear what they have to say. So I take that point. I always think it is good to remind me and everybody who listens to the show that they are weird. And if their intuitions about politics were shared, politics would not look the way it does at all. Right If the voting population were, show listeners and people they then elections end up very differently. So I take your point on survey data. So where do we begin. All right. So first I'm just going to start with this slide over here that just looks at support for the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020 and 2024 by race and ideology. In 2016, Democrats got 81 percent of Hispanic moderates, and in 2024, Democrats got 58 percent of Hispanic moderates. That's only about 7 percent more than the 52 percent that they got of white moderates. The main story with respect to this is just a continuation of the trends that we saw four years ago. Throughout the entire Trump campaign, we've seen this racial polarization. The thing I find most surprising here is you look at white voters liberal, moderate and conservative. And at least in this data from 2016 to 2024, there is a 0 percent swing in any of them, because there are all these things that if you go back to the debates we were having about Donald Trump, then it is the return and resurgence of a coalition trying to protect white power in this country. And I wrote things about this. I think there was good reason to believe that even if that was part of the intention, then that does not appear in the results. So the Democrats lose modest amount of support among Black voters in those years. They lose a huge amount of support among Hispanic voters and a significant amount among Asian voters. Why do you think that is. I think that a lot of political analysis in America has been really centered around viewing everything through a very America centric lens, because there's this story in American politics. If you want to understand 20th century American politics, then the big story is that there was this giant Southern realignment in 1964, driven by the Civil Rights Act, driven by the Civil Rights Act, and that carried forward. It took a really long time for that to really work its way through downballot. And so I think it was really tempting for American political scientists and a lot. The more detail oriented American political pundits to just kind of see everything. People who wrote books like why were polarized, for instance. Yeah, exactly just to see everything through this transformation. Thomas Piketty actually recently wrote a great book about this thing I'm about to talk about. But I think the most important trend politically of the last 30 to 40 years, both here and in every other country in the world, at least Western country that has elections has been the story of education, polarization. That basically everywhere we've seen highly educated people move to the left and working class people move to the right. I think a lot of people's analytical error when looking at Trump is that they saw Trump as this kind of reincarnation of the 1960s of like George Wallace or something, when really I think he was representing this global trend. You could look at a bunch of other countries. You have Marine Le Pen in France, you have the AFD in Germany. And I think that people miss that. There was kind of a broader global appeal, this kind of polarization on values. The other thing that I find interesting here is the shift in voters who self-describe as conservative, right. There's no shift in white, self-described conservative voters between 2016 and 2024, but Democrats are winning 85 percent of Black conservatives in 2016, but only 77 percent in 2024. They're winning 34 percent of conservative Hispanics in 2016. That falls by half to 17 percent in 2024. They're winning 28 percent of conservative Asians in 2016. That falls to 20 percent in 2024. So it's always a little bit weird for somebody who is self-described conservative to be voting for Democrats who are quite a Liberal Party now. But what we're seeing among nonwhite voters is people voting more their ideology and less their ethnic group. That's exactly right. And I would just say, I think this shouldn't be that surprising. I think now, we identify the Democratic Party as straightforwardly liberal. The Democratic Party used to be a coalition between liberals and moderates and conservatives. And as liberals kind of became the dominant coalition partner. It makes sense, that the conservatives and moderates in our coalition, who were disproportionately nonwhite, given that this ideological polarization happened among whites 20 years ago or 30 years ago, that you would start to see this. All right. Let's move to slide two here. All right. But there were some new trends this cycle. So I can hear you going to presentation voice. Yeah great. Great, great. You're good. So this slide over here has what I think is probably the most important story of this cycle. So I have two graphs over here. The first breaks down 2020 for support by whether or not you had voted in 2020. And so this is New York Times' data from Nate Cohen's upshot polling, probably the highest quality public pollster in America. And what you can see here is just that in 2020, in their data, people who didn't vote if they had voted would have been a little bit more Democratic than the country overall. But over the next four years, people who didn't vote went from being a somewhat Democratic leaning group to a group that Trump won by double digits. So the second graph here, we have for every precinct, we look at what percentage of people voted in 2022. And then we just look at what was the change in Democratic vote share from 2020 to 2024. And so what you can see here is that for the lowest turnout precincts, Trump increased his vote share by something like 6 percent While for the highest turnout precincts, Harris actually increased her support. And that's really the story of this election is that people who follow news really closely, who get their news from traditional media, who say that politics is an important part of their identity. They became more Democratic in absolute terms. But for people who don't follow politics closely at all, they just became a lot more Republican. It's interesting because I obviously get a lot of incoming from people who would like the New York Times' to cover Donald Trump differently. And some of those arguments I agree with, some of them I don't. That's what I always think about with that, though, is that if your lever is New York Times' headlines, you're not affecting the voters you are losing. And the question Democrats are facing. When you look at how badly they lost less politically engaged voters is, how do you change the views of voters. You don't really have a good way to reach. Yeah, and I mean, that's 100 percent And, I just want to stress that this is a new problem. This problem didn't exist four years ago. And it's not just that New York Times' readers are more liberal than the overall population. That's definitely true. It's that they're more liberal than they were four years ago, even though the country went the other way. And so there's this great political divergence between people who consume all the news sources that we know about and read about versus the people who don't. And so, as a result of these changes, we're really this is really reversed, a decades long truism in American politics where for the longest time, Democrats have said, and it's been true, that if everybody votes, we win. And that higher turnout is good for Democrats, and this is the first cycle where that definitively became the opposite of true. Here I just have some numbers. If only people who had voted in 2022 had voted, Harris would have won the popular vote and also the electoral college fairly easily. While if everyone had voted, Trump would have won the popular vote by nearly 5 points. Generally, what you see now is that every measure of socioeconomic status and political engagement is just monotonically related to your chance of liking Trump. What is monotonically related. Yeah sorry. Just that this is why Democrats can't win. That's exactly right. I'm the problem. But it's basically just that the more even the lowest political engagement categories, the lowest education categories, the poorer the lower socioeconomic status, the less engaged you are in politics now, the more Trumpy you are. And that just wasn't true four years ago. So here here's something that I've heard from a lot of Democrats and very good election analysts, which seems to be in some tension here. There is an argument that what happened to Democrats between 2020 and 2024 is their voters stayed home. And so what happened here was a shrinking of the electorate that disproportionately sliced off what Democrats for a while were calling the anti MAGA coalition. How does that idea that Democrats didn't lose to Trump, they lost to the couch set with you. It's just not empirically correct. I would say generally turnout and support go in the same direction for the basic reason that there are a lot of people who didn't feel ready to vote for a Republican but were still mad at the Democratic Party, and so they stayed home in response. And if you just look at the demographics of who these people are, who voted for Biden last time and stayed home this time, they're generally low education. They're fairly politically disengaged. They're much less likely to watch shows like MSNBC and more likely to watch shows like Fox, and they frankly just look a lot like the voters who trended away from us. So if you had forced them out to vote, they may have just voted for Donald Trump. Exactly And that does show up. If you look at African-Americans, for example, African-Americans who didn't vote were much more likely to say that they supported Trump than the ones that did this cycle. It's true that overall turnout fell in a lot of the country, but in the battleground states that actually decided the presidential election, turnout was roughly where it was from four years ago. And it just is clear as day that a bunch of people changed their mind. How much is this just inflation. You are dealing with people who they're not paying a lot of attention to politics. They do pay attention and feel prices and the state of the country. You had a massive inflationary period and they're pissed and being pissed about inflation. Move them against the incumbent party, which they held responsible in this country, as in other countries, for inflation. I think that that's a very reasonable explanation. It makes sense that the people who care the least about politics are going to be the most mad about prices going up, and there's a lot of academic reasons to think that makes sense. I'm not making any claims, per se, about why this happened, though I think inflation makes sense. If you actually poll these non-voters and ask them what did they care the most about they'll tell you inflation. I'll get to this later. But that's what every single subgroup of the electorate cared the most about by overwhelming margins. And so I don't think it's necessarily true that it's impossible for us to win those voters back. But, I'll talk about this later. There have been dramatic shifts in the media consumption habits of these people in the last four years. And so it may be a harder problem. Before you discuss, I think it's worth talking to the next chart, too, because it's getting at the same question in a different way. So here, we have a plot that we just took from The Economist. And in the bottom, we just have foreign born population and on the top we just have increase in Republican vote share. And what you could see is there's a very clear correlation. This is by County. This is by County. There's a very clear correlation between how many immigrants there were in a County and how much it increased by Donald Trump, towards Trump. You can see in counties like Queens, New York or miami-dade and Florida. Trump increased his vote share percentage by 10 percentage points, which is just crazy. And so when we go and we look at the precinct election results, what we see is that in immigrant communities of all races, our best guess is that immigrants went from being a Biden plus 27 group in 2020 to a group that Trump narrowly won in 2024. This group, of naturalized citizens is roughly 10 percent of the electorate. So that means that immigrants swung much, much, much more than the median of the electorate. That's exactly right. Our estimates, and it's really hard to know exactly what happened. It turns out that working class immigrants do not answer a ton of surveys, but our best guess is that they swung 23 percentage points against the Democratic Party. And so the crazy thing is, if you believe this and there's some uncertainty, but I think some version of this is probably true, then something like half of the net votes that Trump received came from immigrants. And this wasn't efficient for him. It's one of the big reasons, why the bias of the electoral college went down by so much this cycle. Because if you look in the battleground states, things swung toward Trump maybe by like half a percentage point. And that was enough for him to win or one percentage point. But if you look at the four biggest states where immigrants are concentrated New York, California, Texas, Trump did extremely well. And so it wasn't very efficient for him. But in terms of people changing their mind It was a massive percentage of the story. So this gets to another way that I think the data has proven conventional wisdom from at least 2020 wrong. So 2020, you have an election that Joe Biden wins. He wins by less than the polling says he will win by. And one reason he wins by less than the polling says he'll win by, is that Donald Trump does much better with Hispanic and Asian voters than he was expected to. And I remember seeing pretty strong research afterwards and talking to people who study the Hispanic vote who were saying, well, in 2020, the pandemic really scrambled what the election was about. So in 2016, the election was about immigration. In 2020, it was about the pandemic. It was about lockdowns. It was about the economy. And so Hispanic voters who were driven off of Trump by his border talk in 2016 were more likely to vote for him in 2020. But that was weird, right. It was the pandemic, in a way, moderating Donald Trump's appeal. 2024 Trump runs, I would say, to the right of where he was on the border in 2016, right. We're talking mass deportations. We're talking more than a wall. And Trump does better among immigrant groups, and he really ever has before. So the Democratic belief that when the topic turned back to immigration, you would see some of that polarization around Trump return and that he would be harmed in immigrant communities did not occur. No inflation probably played some kind of role here, though. The flip side is if you look in the UK, it happened the same year. It's just that the incumbent was right wing instead of left wing. And their labor did also drop with black and Asian and Hindu voters. And so I think that there's some kind of globalized right wing phenomena that's happening. It's hard to know exactly what, but I agree completely. Now just move on to the next slide here we have Harris support by single age year by race and gender. I found this chart a little hard to read. So can you describe to me what's happening here. Sure so we have four lines on this chart. And the x-axis is age. And the axis is our estimate. For what fraction of people in that group voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. And we have a light blue line for women of color. We have a dark blue dashed line for men of color. We have a light pink solid line for white women, and then a dashed line for white men. And one of the things you can see here is if you just look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old women of color are the only of the four that actually voted that Harris won. Trump narrowly won nonwhite men. So I do find this part of this chart shocking it. I sometimes talk about narrative violations. And I think if we knew anything about Donald Trump eight years ago. It's at young people did not like him. And Republicans are maybe throwing away young people for generations in order to run up their margins among seniors. But if you look at this chart among white men who were 75 years old supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than white men who were 20 years old. That's exactly right. That's a real shift. It is a real shift. This is the thing I am the most shocked by. I think in the last four years, is that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the baby boomers, and maybe in some ways more so to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we've experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years. And so the next chart, just to describe it, this chart in some ways convinced me to do this podcast. Oh Thank you. This chart shocks me. I agree, this is to me the scariest chart in this entire presentation. And again, something I'm very surprised by. In the bottom, we have age, and at the top, we have the gender gap in support between women and men and for support for Kamala Harris. And so what you can see is that for voters over 30, the gender gap was fairly stable at around 10 percent which is roughly where it's been in American politics. For voters over 75, it's even lower. That's right. Fairly low gender gap among older voters. Yeah, I think that a lot of people underestimate how recent the gender gap is. Historically, Republicans did better with women than men. And this was true across most of the West that center left parties did better with men than women. And that's changed in the United States in the Clinton era. But it's been stable since then. But what's crazy is if you look at people who are under the age of 30, the gender gap has exploded. If you look at 18-year-olds, 18-year-old men were 23 percentage points more likely to support Donald Trump than 18-year-old women, which is just completely unprecedented in American politics. Is that abortion. I think it's too early to say exactly what the cause is. What's interesting is that this is happening in other countries as well. Obviously, different countries have different political systems, but I've seen similar patterns in Canada, in the UK, in Norway, there's a lot of research to do here. But it's still very striking. A lot of people talk about the Democratic young men problem, and I think it's still somehow underrated because the actual numbers are just a lot worse than people think. The huge gender gap implies to me, it's not just inflation. Women pay high prices for eggs, too. And I'll say, if you look at the UK election last year, the Labour Party did a lot better because the incumbent party was unpopular. But I think what's interesting is that if you look at it by age, the conservatives actually increased their vote share among 18 to 24-year-old voters, I think by 2 percent or 3 percent even though they only did even though they did 8 percent or 9 percent worse overall. And so I do think it's not just inflation. It's not just backlash to the incumbent governments, though I'm sure that's part of the story, too. I feel like the story you're implying that you believe here is that this is polarization among young men and women, driven by men who are in high school, who are young, who are online, practically online during COVID as MeToo is cresting at the time of as Jordan Peterson is a big figure. Andrew Tate is rising. UVA now gets called the manosphere. But there is a sense the Democratic Party is becoming much more pro-women party. And in some ways anti young men and that just had a huge effect on young men's political opinions. Well, I do want to just stress that this seems to be a global phenomena. And I don't want to over center the particular things the Democratic Party has done rather than the broader cultural. Peterson and Tate are global figures. No, exactly. I agree with that. What I'll say is I just think that we're in the midst of a big cultural change, that I think that people are really underestimating. If you look at Zoomers, I don't have slides on this, but there's just a lot of really interesting ways that they're very different in the data. They're much more likely than previous generations to say that making money is extremely important to them. They are a lot more. If you look at their psychographic data, they have a lot higher levels of psychometric, neuroticism and anxiety than the people before them. If I was going to speculate I think that phones and social media have a lot to do with this. I think it's very plausible to me. And I've heard people describe that these kids grew up looking at social media influencers as role models. But all I can say is that I think that young people today seem to have fairly different values than they did 10 years ago. How that translates into partisan politics depends on what the parties do, but I think it's a big shift. It seems plausible to me that social media, online culture are splitting the media that young men and women get that if you are young and online and a 23-year-old man who is interested in UFC, you're being driven into a very intensely male online world. Whereas if you are 23 years old and female and you are interested in things that the YouTube algorithm codes, that way you are not entering that world. You're actually entering the opposite world. You're seeing brené Brown, right. You're seeing these other things. The capacity to be in highly gendered media worlds is really different in 2024 than it was in 2004, and that's true worldwide. Yeah, I agree with that entirely. Online communities are way more gender segregated than offline communities are. And so in that respect, it should be unsurprising that suddenly shifting a bunch of young people's social worlds to be entirely online all at once cause the political situation to change. So Democrats are getting destroyed now among young voters. That's right. I do think there was. Even as the idea of the rising demographic Democratic majority had become a little discredited in 2016 and 2020. I do think Democrats believed that these young voters were eventually going to save them, that this was a last gasp of something that if Donald Trump couldn't run these numbers up among seniors. And you had millennials really coming into their voting power, Gen Z coming in. That was going to be the end of this Republican Party. And that just completely false. Yeah, I mean, it might be the beginning of this Republican Party. I have to admit, I was one of those liberals four years ago. And it seems like I was wrong. The future has a way of surprising us. The flip side of this is that Democrats made a bunch of gains among older voters, and I'm sure that they'll be happy that they did two years from now, two years from now in the midterms. But if we don't do anything about this, then this problem could become very bad. So right here, I have this slide. This is very simple. This is just showing exit poll favorability for the Democratic and Republican presidential candidate in 2020 and 2024. And I think it's just really important to ground any discussion of the election with the simple fact that Donald Trump was just as unpopular on election day last year as he was in 2020 and maybe even a little bit more unpopular. But what changed is that Biden had a net favorability rating of plus 6, and Harris had a net favorability rating of minus 6. So I want to play Mike Donilon, who was chief strategist to Joe Biden, was recently at a forum, and he made an argument that I think you at least could read this chart as backing up, which is that Biden was more popular in 2020 than Harris was in 2024. Maybe the Biden Harris switch was a mistake. Here's Donilon. Look, I think folks who had this view believe that Biden was going to lose. He didn't have it anymore. He had to get out. That was the best thing for the party. I understand that's their view. But, I have a view too, right. In my view, is that really I think it was insane. I think the party lost its mind. Did the party lose its mind. And that's why we see this chart. I think the best explanation for why Kamala Harris was unpopular is in this next slide, which is just that the Biden administration was extremely unpopular for most of its term. They saw their approval fall off a cliff after Afghanistan, and then it dropped further as inflation and immigration and the budget fights all happen in the fall. And then it never recovered. And I think the big challenge that Kamala Harris faced was just that she was seen as too close, to the Biden administration, which most voters considered to be a failure. And so, I mean, you can never tell. You can never tell a counterfactual world, but I think that Biden would have had an even harder time distinguishing himself from his record. Yeah, it would be even harder for Joe Biden to run away from Joe Biden, I guess. Yeah, looking at this chart, it looks like by January a plus 20 net disapproval. Maybe that was a little bit smaller in November, but it had been widening. I mean, you go back to the beginning of 2023, it was narrower. People were really pissed at the Biden administration, by the time we hit the election. Yeah, I think that the big salient fact about this election. And, I don't think it was impossible for Kamala to do better. This was a winnable election. At the end of the day, it was very close. But this was the big thing, that was weighing Democrats down. And so I just want to move forward, just in terms of why, in our polling, the way that we measure issue importance is we show people two random issues and we just ask which of these problems is more important to the problems facing the country today. And people pick. And when you model it out, whenever you have cost of living or inflation put up against something else, eight or 9 out of 10 people picked that cost of living and inflation was more important. And so I think this just really shows how dominant this was. Voters were really angry about the Biden administration's handling of inflation, of the budget deficit of crime of immigration. And I think that was just a hard thing to escape. Well, you just ticked off a bunch of issues. But what's interesting to me about this particular bit of data is it shows that cost of living and inflation beat almost anything you put in front of it, so I agree. What I find notable here I mean Yeah, cost of living was bigger than student debt fare, but you tested it against immigration and border security and the share of voters saying cost of living or inflation was more important was about 70 percent That's right you tested it against abortion. Their cost of living or inflation was more important to about 80 percent of voters against environment and climate change. 84 percent of voters picked cost of living inflation. One thing that the Biden people always believed was that this election would be very heavily about democracy itself. I mean, this was something that I was told by top Biden strategists going way back. I don't see democracy on here. January 6. The stability of the system. Did you test that, too. No we did. And later we have a slide on. I mean, I'm just going to scroll down to it now since you brought it up. But we did a survey where we just asked people, what's more important right now preserving America's institutions or delivering change that improves people's lives. And it was 78 to 18. Delivering change that improves people's lives. And I'm just going to scroll up. But I think what's really hard, I think this has been one of the hardest things about being a political consultant in the last eight years is that every day, Trump does terrible things that I think are objectively awful and scary, and it piss me off. I'm going to prosecute my enemies or whatever. And then we do a bunch of tests and voters really don't want to hear about it. From us, I think that Trump would do better if he didn't do that stuff. For sure. But I think that voters want us to talk about concrete ways that they're going to improve people's lives. There is an argument you hear from many Democrats. There was no problem here except for inflation, that, in fact, if you compare Democratic vote outcomes with incumbent parties in many other countries, Democrats did better than incumbent parties in other countries did. So you look at the conservatives in the UK, they had a much worse election result. You look at what happened to the ruling coalition in France. In some ways Democrats were doing fine. They had a fairly modest drop in support. And it's just a shame for them that inflation happened on their watch, that if Donald Trump had won the 2020 election, inflation would have happened on his watch, completely discrediting him and his administration. And that would have been the end of them. How do you distinguish between. There is a broad structural problem the Democratic Party is facing that it needs to think about for 2028, and there's actually no problem here. But I think I just want to go over to the next slide. When we measure issues, we measure how important voters find it. And that's what we have in the bottom here. And then we just measure. Do you trust Democrats or Republicans more on this issue. And what you see here is if you look at the top issues that voters care the most about cost of living, the economy, taxes and government spending the deficit, foreign policy, health other than health, where Democrats have a narrow lead, Republicans have massive trust advantages 15 points on all of the issues that voters care the most about. And so the story that I would tell in response to your question is that in this election, voters trusted Republicans way more than Democrats on all of the most important issues, but also bought into this idea that Donald Trump was a terrible person who couldn't be trusted with power. And that made the election be close. But four years from now, Donald Trump will not be the nominee, and maybe they'll nominate somebody who's just as terrible and just as unlikable. But if we don't, get out of this trust deficit, I think that we'll have a lot of problems for people listening along. This is a chart broken into quadrants. That's right. And the top right quadrant is issues that are very important and issues where Democrats are more trusted. And it's an untilled bit of farmland up there. That's right. So there's mental health, which voters don't rate that important, but they do trust Democrats quite a bit more. They rate it higher than they rate, though. Climate change and the environment and abortion, which struck me as surprising. Mental health seems like a much bigger deal on this then you typically then I think politics reflects on either side right there. One bright spot is really health care. That's right. That's kind of it in terms of issues where it is quite important and they have a genuinely noticeable advantage. Yeah, I think it's just worth saying that four years ago the number one issue was COVID and health care. And those also were the issues that people trusted Democrats the most on. And so the strategy was really obvious. Just talk a lot about COVID and health care. But this time we had a much harder problem, which was that the issues that people cared the most about for the most part, voters didn't trust us on and the issues that people did trust us on climate change, and reproductive rights, probably the big ones voters just didn't care very much about. And so that was just a very difficult strategic position. And it's also one that was just very different than it was four years ago. All right. I just want to tick off some issues voters ranked as important that they trusted Republicans on and then ask you a question about it. So they thought. Cost of living, the economy and inflation were very important. Had a lot more trust in Republicans. They thought national security and foreign policy were important. Trusted Republicans, taxes. Government spending. Government debt. Trusted Republicans. Crime immigration. Trusted Republicans. Social Security. Trusted Republicans. That seems like a bad one for Democrats, a political division they thought was important. They trusted Republicans. A bit more on that in this data. If I looked over time, if I looked at 2016 and I looked at 2020, would I see on all of these that Republicans had advantages and Democrats were just winning on health care. How much of this is something flipping around as an incumbent penalty and reaction to conditions in the country at that moment, and how much of it is a durable situation where Republicans have a trust advantage, where Democrats would have to act in a spectacular way over time to change voters impressions of them on that issue. What we saw in our data was that as the Biden administration became a lot more unpopular all of these things dropped a lot. So some of it was uniform shift. But I think that the last four years, there were some things that structurally changed a lot in every center left party in the world. Generally the left has its issues that it owns and the right has its issues that it owns. But usually the economy is pretty neutral. During the Trump administration, the economy was fairly neutral. And in 2020, I think if you looked at this and even in 2021, it really didn't look anything like this. Another really big shift was just that education has gone from being basically one of the best issues for Democrats to being something that's basically neutral now. And we saw that in the Virginia gubernatorial election in 2021, we even saw it be an advantage for Republicans. And then the other big shift in the other side was that reproductive rights used to be a fairly neutral issue for Democrats like in general. When you talked about it in the pre Dobbs era, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that changed a lot of oats. And immediately after Dobbs, we saw a party trust on reproductive rights shoot up. And so I think these numbers they do change. And this is one of the big messages I want to get through is just that, the world has changed a lot in the last four years. It's going to keep changing. And we have to adjust in response to what happens. All right. So this tell me what's going on in this next slide. Because I also, as I understand this is really very connected to the work you do specifically. So what are you doing here. All right. So one of the big things that my firm does, it's probably our biggest product is that we do randomized controlled trials on ads. This is something that both parties do. This is pretty standard. But the idea is that for a given ad, you take 1,000 people split them into a treatment and control group. 500 people see the ad, 500 people don't. And then you survey them after. And you see, ask them who they're voting for. And then the difference between treatment and control can be described as the causal effect of if you see this ad, this is the effect it will have on your chance of voting for them. And so we tested on the order of I'd say probably like four or $5,000 Harris ads last cycle. And I just wanted to call out these two ads that were in the top 1 percent of ads that we tested. One is from Kamala Harris. I get it. The cost of rent, groceries and utilities is too high. So here's what we're going to do about it. We will lower housing costs by building more homes and crack down on landlords who are charging too much. We will lower your food and grocery bills by going after price gougers who are keeping the cost of everyday goods too high. I'm Kamala Harris and I approve this message because you work hard for your paycheck, you should get to keep more of it. As president, I'll make that my top priority. Obviously, there's a lot for several parts of the Democratic coalition there. Another ad by future forward shows attacks him for a national sales tax for the idea that Trump's tax him being Trump. Yeah attacks Trump. He fights for himself and his billionaire friends. He intends to enact a national sales tax. The Trump tax that would raise prices on middle class families by $4,000 a year. Instead of a tax hike, we will pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. As attack is responsible for the content of this ad, these were obviously the best ads in the campaign. And the point, I just want to say is, I think this reinforces the point that what voters cared the most about was the cost of living, and that voters were really mad about the actual situation. And I think that Harris being able to in this ad acknowledging oh, things are actually very bad. I don't like this. I have a plan to fix. This is part of what made it so effective. There is a view out there. I saw Jacobin had just done some research on this, which is a socialist publication that at the beginning of the Harris campaign, sprint, I mean, she was only the head of the Democratic ticket for three months. She was talking a lot about the economy and that by the end, she was talking a lot about democracy, that there had been a change in the nature of the campaign, the ads it was running, how they were messaging. Their big closing argument was that the ellipses in Washington, DC, which is where the January 6 riots, in a way, began that there was phases of the Harris campaign, and the first one was more populist and the last one was more institutional. From what you saw, was that true. I think that there was this big strategic question that Democrats faced. And it wasn't just the Harris campaign, which is polling would tell them you should talk about the economy, or voters care a lot about the cost of living. But it's very hard, one to get media attention on those things. And two, I think that Trump has done a good job of baiting us. I think what's really interesting about a lot of the democracy and authoritarian stuff is just that how concerned you are by it really varies a lot by political engagement and by education and the kind of people who set media decisions at CNN or who work in politics are the kinds of people who are going to be much more concerned about it, than working class folks are. And so I think that but but look, there is a difference between the Harris campaign was running the optimal David Shor strategy in late October of 2024, and they were not. The Harris campaign had access future before it had access to all of this issue by issue polling. They had access to all this randomized ad testing. Did they run a heavily economic campaign and it didn't work, or did they not run a heavily economic campaign at the end. And it didn't work, because, look, if they did the thing and it didn't work, then maybe it just didn't work. Did they not do it. Yeah, I mean, asking the hard questions. But yeah, I think obviously, I think that Democratic messaging last cycle was not economically focused enough. I think that it focused too much on narratives of defending institutions, defending democracy. And I think it's just very easy, for folks to fall into that trap. But I really don't. But why. If they did that and I heard this from different people. David Plouffe is a smart guy. I'm not telling you to. I'm not asking you to critique David Plouffe. I can watch you getting physically uncomfortable as I. As I harm your business here. right, right. But these people all wanted to win. They really did. Every single one of them. And they had a lot of data. So I think this has been a thing on my mind. If they weren't running the optimal strategy, why. I know it's hard to get media attention for things, and that's fair enough. But it's also not impossible to get media attention for things right. For instance, it's very easy to get media attention for anti-price gouging policies because there's a lot of controversy over them about whether or not they worked. But they did make people talk about whether or not you were going to do an anti-price gouging policy. This is a Donald Trump move, constantly announce a policy that probably doesn't work, or is in some way outrageous or beyond the bounds of political possibility, maybe isn't even all that popular when you poll, but you get people talking about you having a very strong view. You're going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. Everybody knows Mexico isn't going to pay for it. But you are talking about how Donald Trump hates immigration. And it breaks through. It is not rocket science to get people to pay attention. If Bernie Sanders had been running in the campaign, people would have paid attention to his economic messaging because he does economic messaging that creates conflict. If it was really this big delta between the economic push and the institutions push, and the institutions push is what got made, or at least got made more than 1, it should have. Why the thing I'll say, in terms of why I'm sympathetic to the people who actually had these jobs and had to make these decisions, is it just feels wrong. I have a situation, I mentioned this before where donors will email me and they'll be like Oh, look at this crazy, absolutely terrible thing, this evil thing that Trump is doing. We need to test it. We need to tell the voters, can you test it. And it really doesn't work. People want to hear about eggs. And it's easy for me to say that, because I don't really I'm not directly in charge. But I just think it just feels really wrong when you're in the moment. It's just it's very hard to totally shift direction, just because data tells you one thing. I do think the campaign photo ops that we all remember at the end are telling, which is it was an extraordinary visual. Harris at the Ellipse. And then there were the visuals of Donald Trump in a garbage truck and Donald Trump at McDonald's. And there was a Ridiculousness to those visuals. I saw a lot of liberals making fun of them on various social media platforms, but there was something about which visuals are being chosen by the two candidates. I mean, of the two of them, only Kamala Harris had actually worked at a McDonald's. Sure, but she wasn't the one who ended up like putting on the apron and getting photographed at McDonald's. And there's a thing about what the candidates end up wanting to do that is meaningful to. And I do think there's a way in which I wonder if that explains part of what we ended up seeing. Each coalitions campaigns are ultimately going to reflect the aesthetic and cultural choices of the people who staff them. And, it makes sense. If you had just said two years ago, Trump's going to end by showing up at a McDonald's. Like, it just wouldn't have been surprising, I think. And so it's just hard to escape, that kind of demographic pull. But we have to try because we have to actually win these people over. And so now I just have I have a couple more slides I want to go through. I talked about this before, but voters cared a lot more about delivering change than preserving institutions. And then we have this other polling question here, which I think is interesting, which is just asking people to pick between the statements. Things could be going better in America, but what we need is a return to basic stability. And the other is things in America are going poorly, and what's needed is a major change and a shock to the system. And when you have those two things, it's 53, 37, which is a lot wider than the election result ended up being. What really strikes me about this is that sometimes I read polls, and the wording is pretty clearly there to make something sound better than the other thing. Things could be going better in America, and what is needed is return to basic stability from whoever becomes president. And things in America are going poorly, and what is needed is a major change and a shock to the system from whoever becomes president. I would in some ways say the second there is worded to turn people off a little bit, it sounds disruptive crisis, a shock. It's not just major change. It is something beyond that. And it dominates, I guess, though, I have a question about this, which is on the one hand, we see lines like that outpolling the incremental change everywhere. On the other hand, if you look at the New split ticket ratings for who overperformed in the election. Very moderate. House Democrats did very well. Totally there does seem to me to be a tension between two forms of political wisdom that both have data behind them right now. Which is that voters want huge, massive change. And the optimal political strategy is Joe Manchin or Jared Golden or Ruben Gallego, who are actually not. Or Susan Collins, who are not people who promise unbelievably shocking change. They are moderates who kind of tack between the parties a little bit and try to represent a center that wants something a little bit less dramatic than either side is offering. How do you reconcile them. There's an enormous amount of status quo bias in politics. Campaigning on big policy changes can be pretty unpopular. But I think the way to thread the needle, what this is really saying is that voters were very angry about the state of things, and what they wanted tonally was someone who acknowledged that anger because Ruben and Gallego did a lot of criticism of the status quo and was able to outperform. So people on an angry moderate. That's right. I think that's exactly right. Like they want not AI always think of temperament and ideology as being separate axes in American politics that we connect too much. So we think about people who are moderates often have the moderate temperament. Susan Collins is like the great example, the joke always of the Susan Collins meter from somewhat concerned all the way to very concerned being the red line for her. You have a lot of moderates who by nature they're pretty chill. They try to be civil. What this is implying is what people want are moderate policies in a more revolutionary or certainly more upset temperament. Yeah, we're pissed, but not ideologically extreme about it. It's like a funny chant. But when people think about moderates, they think of somebody like Joe Manchin, someone who's just like down the line on everything. And the reality. I think that an accurate description of what highly educated moderates are like. But most low socioeconomic status moderates actually have fairly incoherent views. They're liberal on some issues. They're very conservative on other issues. And I think that that's just like a much closer fit. For And that's when you think of that, it's maybe less surprising that a lot of them Donald Trump back in 2016, I wrote a piece about Donald Trump that has one of these headlines that now people will sometimes screenshot and be mad at me about but it's called something like Donald Trump is a perfect moderate. And the point of the piece was not that he's not extreme, because I think he is extreme, but that the way his politics worked, practically on the campaign trail in things he said, was that it was internally disorganized, so he'd be extremely far right on immigration. But compared to other Republicans, much more centrist on things like Medicare and Social Security. He would talk about giving health care to everybody, even though Republicans wouldn't like that. He talked about raising taxes on people like him, not how he governed. But there's a lot of research that actual moderates, people in the elected who are moderate. It's not that they have in between the two parties view on everything, it's that they might believe in completely legalized weed, on the one hand, and mass deportations on the other, that it's like if you imagine positions as being they can be very liberal or very conservative. They average out to moderate as opposed to being consistently moderate. That's exactly right. And the way I like to put that in math terms, the issue correlations for highly educated people are just a lot higher than they are. Your eyebrows get excited when you do math terms. Yeah no. I'm sorry. It's all right. But I'm glad we started talking about ideology because that dovetails to the next slide. Here we just ask for each of the candidates. Do you think this candidate was more liberal than me, more conservative than me, or close to my views. So when you look at this slide, what you see is that 49 percent of voters said that Kamala Harris was more liberal than me, while only 39 percent of voters said that Donald Trump was more conservative than me. And so there was this big ideological perception gap where a lot of voters saw Donald Trump as more as more moderate than Kamala Harris. What did this look like in 2016 and 2020? So in 2016, it looked fairly similar to this. In 2020, perceptions of Donald Trump being too extreme went up relative to 2016, and perceptions of the Democratic candidate being too extreme went down from 2016 to 2020. Now that I think wasn't a property of Joe Biden per se. Like, him being moderate was a big part of his brand at that time. But in our polling, we would ask, do you think that Joe Biden is too liberal or too conservative or whatever. And we saw that over the course of 2021, as his approval ratings dipped, the perception that he was too liberal also went up. Well, it's also true that Joe Biden became more liberal like in terms of how he governed and in terms of what he ran on. So you're saying that in the 2020 election, you actually did see people say that they were ideologically closer to Biden than to Trump. Yes And then over time, that eroded, that eroded. The thing I want to say here before I move on is I'm really not trying to beat up on Kamala Harris here. I think if you just step back, if you have a situation where the Democratic Party, where only 42 percent of Americans trust the Democratic Party on the economy relative to 58 for Republicans. Obviously, the standard bearer of the Democratic Party is going to be perceived as too left wing unless they unless they do a lot of stuff to try to counterbalance that. I mean, people were living under the biden-harris administration, whatever they thought of it. The line Trump would sometimes deliver on Harris, which in many ways is unfair if you're a super politically engaged voter and you have a lot of thoughts about the powers of the vice presidency. But to most people, if you have all these great ideas, why don't you do them. In the last four years, while your vice president was a pretty strong argument. I think there's a good argument that given that, it's amazing that we did as well as we did. But it was a close election. And so who knows what the counterfactual could have been. I want to note something as a dog that is not barking across this presentation. Yeah since the election, I think that if you look at what Donald Trump is doing, what Elon Musk is doing, and if you look at punditry about the election, that if everybody agrees on anything, it's that the election was a huge verdict on wokeness. Famously, one of Trump's higher testing ads was this Kamala Harris is her they/them Donald Trump is for you as you're running through this. I'm not saying you're saying DEI programs are popular, but I'm not seeing it emerge as a major explanation for 2024 here. I'm curious how you both think about it in the election and think about the role that's playing in the post-election narrative. I just want to say, they/them ad that everybody talks about it was a good ad, but it was like a 70th percentile ad. In our testing, if you look at all of the best testing ads from Donald Trump, it was basically the economy. It was gas prices, it was immigration, it was crime. And so I think that there's definitely been an overfocus on die, on wokeness, on trans issues. I think it definitely played a role on the elite discourse and why so many tech CEOs have become more right wing. And all of that. But I think that the voters were really mad about inflation and crime and immigration and the budget deficit. And I think the Republicans are making a mistake, honestly, to focus on these things. So much relative to concrete issues that people actually care about. I think that there's this bigger picture point I want to make where I think that a lot of people see the Trump administration as kind of a break that shows that all of the traditional rules of politics, no longer apply. And I think to some extent that's wrong, that a lot of what's happening is really very easy to understand. Donald Trump, to go back to the ideological thing he broke with his party. He might have been dishonest about it, but he disavowed Project 2025. He said that he wouldn't cut Social programs, he ruled out a national abortion ban. And I think that kind of thing just plays a big role in his success. And I think that a lot of these newer things that we talk about might be less important than we think. But the flip side is it's possible that when it comes to something like, why is it that 20-year-old men are so much more conservative than they were four years ago. I could believe maybe wokeness has something to do with that, but I think that the bulk of this is traditional factors. So now I just have the last slide of the retrospective. What I have here is we have the share of voters who get their news from TikTok by year, the share of voters who get their news of young voters, who get their news from TikTok more than quadrupled in the last four years. This is the biggest and probably fastest change in media consumption. That has happened in my lifetime and it was quite correlated with support change. Now, obviously TikTok users are younger, they're less politically engaged. It's not surprising that we dropped among this group. You'd expect that from demographics. But if you go and you do the regressions, I think there was definitely a causal element there. And when you Zoom in, particularly to people who get their news from TikTok who don't care very much about politics, this is a group that's eight percentage points more Republican than they were four years ago. And that's a lot. So by the end of the election, Donald Trump is promising to save TikTok. One possible explanation, then, for TikTok users shifting towards Trump is that they like TikTok, and they didn't want it to be taken away from them. Another, which people have worried about quite a bit, is that the company behind TikTok could very easily have been turning dials just softly. It's not that nothing that is liberal does well on TikTok. I've seen videos of me get posted there and do very well on TikTok, but that it would not be hard to turn up the dial a little bit on issues that are tricky for Democrats. On people complaining about the cost of living on pro-trump influencers. If everybody who the algorithm codes is, pro-trump gets a 7 percent boost. That is pretty that will not be obvious exactly on the app, but could be very, very meaningful in the aggregate when you look at this data. Do you think it is something about TikTok. Do you think it is something about TikTok's audience just being young people who are seeing this movement. Or does it make you suspect dial turning. I don't know the answer to that. It's totally possible. Like, we know that they do. Dial turning on some topics, stuff like Ukraine or Tiananmen Square or whatever. But what I'll say is, I think that TikTok represents something fairly radically different than social networks that came before it. And I'm sure you know that there could be some malfeasance on the part of people who work there. But the thing that I think about sometimes is just that. I think TikTok is really the first social media platform that is really, truly decentralized. Like if you. And what I mean by that is just it's not based on follower graphs. Like if you look at reels or Twitter or whatever, how many people see a video or a piece of content is highly correlated with how many followers that person has. TikTok's a lot more random, and there's very interesting machine learning reasons for why but I think that it really allowed a lot of content that never would have gotten a lot of views on Twitter or on television to suddenly escape containment and get directly into the eyes of people who don't care that much about politics. And, I don't could tell a story that maybe just anti-incumbent stuff is going to do really well on TikTok and Democrats are going to do great. Now, I don't really know. But I think that for whatever reason, this big change I think really did help Republicans. And it's just an example of how the world has really changed a lot. So I know that you're near Democratic both freak out and funding world. I hear a lot from Democrats about how to fix what they now call their media problem. Or sometimes you hear the TikTok problem, maybe pay try to seed creators and give them some support. When you look at this, do you think this is something that an established political party and a bunch of donors can do something about. Or do you think this is a TikTok is a vibes machine. And basically for reasons of inflation, for reasons of incumbency, for reasons of censorious Democratic Party that people got tired of the vibes are bad for Democrats in 2024, and vibes machines like TikTok some of the other social media things, they're going to be an amplifier of bad vibes. So it's not really a thing to do in the sense of strategy. What you're trying to do is be culturally, both in terms of the candidates you have and the actual things you say and believe. Culturally a better product, and then the things that pick up good cultural products and amplify them are going to be friendlier to you. I think there's a lot of truth in that. I think that TikTok is genuinely strange relative to platforms before it, in that its audience is more politically disengaged and more working class, and I think it's just been very hard for us as a party to find creators and content that appeals to people like that because all of the people who work in Democratic politics are not like that. And I think that in the old traditional media world, we were a lot like the media gatekeepers. And so it was kind of clear how to win that war. And I think Democrats did a good job of doing it. But now we have a totally different fight. So just to move on and talk a little bit about the present as opposed to the long, long time ago of four or five months ago. So, you've talked a lot in your previous episodes about Trump's flood the zone strategy, where he's just constantly doing a bunch of stuff. And what we've done here is we've pulled all his executive orders and stuff that he's campaigned on. I think we have something like 60, 60 dots here. Every one of these dots is a policy that we've pulled. And what you can see is that there's a lot of variance. A lot of the things that he campaigned on no taxes on tips, deploying the military to the border. Voter ID laws, ending remote work for federal employees. A lot of that stuff is very popular. While the flip side is a lot of stuff that he's actually doing. He talks about this stuff less, but Medicaid cuts, repealing the Aca, extending tax cuts to billionaires, a lot of that stuff is really unpopular. Just to say something a little controversial. I think a lot of the challenge of the Trump era is that they're going to try to bait us we should do everything we can to actually meaningfully resist and protect populations that we care about and everything. But I think we need to make sure that we're preserving a considerable amount of time, to attacking Trump on the most effective things that voters are concerned about. You used the term bait a few times. Yeah they're going to try to bait us. I think of a political party baiting you as dangling something in front of you that they know is going to make you mad, but it isn't that big of a deal. They're doing mass firings around critical functions. They're destroying USAID. They're aggregating huge amount of executive power. The set of things that I find Democrats are really worried about at the moment. It's on the one hand, I suspect they're not the things that the public cares about wants to hear that much about making a podcast or the deputy director of the FBI. But at the same time, they're not baiting. They're real. They're important. Like what is the point of a party that will not fight those. And this is a place where I think there is a tension between this focus on what's popular. Don't focus on just the things that activate your high education, high income base. But in terms of getting people out into the streets, potentially, if you need that, getting people to town halls, there's sometimes I think this thought of the party is just going to I mean, James carville's been saying Democrats should basically play dead for a while and wait until the Trump administration's unpopular actions destroy the Trump administration, but don't get in the way. Or there's this version of a party that various things Hakeem Jeffries has said at different points have sounded like this to people, I think is thinking is a little bit more complicated than this. But we're not going to run after all these things. We're going to focus on the price of eggs, the price of goods. You can really lose your own base if you're not defending democracy. When they care about democracy because you're waiting for an opportunity to attack prices, when prices are going to do what prices are going to do. What Democrats say about prices isn't the most salient thing. Am I getting what you're saying right. Is there a way of threading the needle. How do you think about that. Yeah, I think you could imagine a theoretical world where we would have really hard and unpleasant trade offs. But I think the world we actually live in is that a bunch of the things that we're extremely concerned about are actually really unpopular. And just kind of going forward to the next slide. Here's some randomized control trial data that we did that I was talking about earlier with the ads, where we just kind of went through. And we looked at 58 different things that Trump's going to do. And then we rank ordered them by how persuasive they were at actually changing people's votes and making people disapprove of Trump. And I think that a lot of the things that we're most concerned about Ellen, causing chaos in the federal government cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security, extending tax breaks for the rich. I obviously this list of things is not exactly the same as my top five things that I am personally most concerned about with the Trump administration. But I think that the Republicans are making a lot of unforced errors that make it easier to thread the needle on these things than I think it otherwise would be true. But these are also pretty small changes in Trump disapproval if I'm reading what this chart is. If Democrats attack Trump for cutting Medicare and Social Security or wanting to cut Medicare and Social Security, that increases Trump disapproval by 2.5 points. If they attack him for letting Ellen budgets, hurting Americans and putting privacy at risk, that hurts him by 2.2 points. Going down. Passing a one party power grab to cut government services without compromise. That's 2.1 points. These kind of all look the same, and none of them are very big. Can you just like, think for a second like this is like, can you imagine 70 words you like, stop a Trump voter on the street and you say the 70 words to him, and then there's a 2.2 5 percent chance he changed his mind. I think that's incredible. I just think that these two pieces of data tell a story of how we should try to shape the campaign against Trump in the next couple of months, which is that he is wrecking havoc in the federal government. I think that is consistent with our principles and also something that voters are very concerned about. That he is trying to support for the safety net and that he's trying to do tax cuts against the wealthy. And I think that a lot of this critique of Trump is really very similar to the campaign that we ran against Mitt Romney. And I think that this kind of gets back to what I was saying before of I feel like, we were so shocked by Trump that we kind of forgot that the old rules of politics. I want to read two of these because I think something you just said is important when we're talking about these old laws of politics. So here, here's these are all high polling, high testing messages. But this is the lowest one on the chart. So Trump is working to repeal a law that lowers the cost of health and prescription drug costs and caps insulin costs at 35 a month for seniors. By repealing this law, Trump will increase the cost of life saving medicine for millions and create more financial strain when costs are already too high. So that increases Trump disapproval by 1.9 points. I think that is as right down the middle, a Democratic message as you could possibly imagine that does not test as well as Trump is letting Elon Musk federal budgets with no oversight, checks or balances. Musk gave $250 million to Trump's campaign, and now Trump is letting Musk reshape the government in ways that advance Musk's interests, even if they hurt working Americans by cutting the basics like Medicaid and public schools. I am actually surprised that the Elon Musk is out attack is outpolling the insulin attack. And it's interesting because I see this in Trump voters in my own life right there. Some of the ones I they're actually not happy with what's going on in the Trump administration. There's a lot they don't like. There's a lot going on, but too much. But Musk creeps them out. Is that in your data. I think it's really telling that Elon stuff floats to the top here because it's really very hard for something to be competitive with, protect Social Security and Medicare. The fact that there are multiple Elon things up at the top, I think, really does tell a story that there's something really unusual about what he's doing. It's very easy to tie what he's doing to harming individual people. In ads, one of the clearest patterns in ads is that getting a real person and just having them stare at a camera and talk about the ways that Republicans have personally hurt them, it's the best content. It's funny, if you hire actors, it doesn't work as well. People have tried. And that's why in some ways, I'm optimistic that Democrats will be able to thread the coalitional needle here because we should like the two things that we should do is fight against social welfare cuts and also attack Elon Musk for the chaos he's creating. And I think that that's something that basically every wing of the party should be on board with. Donald Trump is polling better than he was at this point in his first term. And the vibes have really shifted in pro-trump direction. And look at how much he and Elon Musk are doing. And, I've certainly talked to Republicans who have this feeling that Trump has unlocked a political juggernaut here, that he has cracked the code of American politics. But you have this. This slide is titled Trump is vulnerable. So why is he vulnerable. Well the first thing you see is that he has been getting more unpopular rapidly as time has gone on. And I just think the most predictable thing in American politics, and we get surprised every single time it happens is the president comes in, he wins a trifecta, and then he does a bunch of unpopular stuff. He overreaches, and then he becomes very unpopular and loses big in the midterms. That doesn't mean that you can't avoid the cycle. But I think that in order to avoid it, when you look at the people who did the best job, Clinton in 1998 or Kennedy in 1962 they did it by engaging in an enormous amount of policy restraint. And that is just not what Trump has been doing at all. And I think that you can just see in the data. But his approval rating is dropping pretty quickly, and you can see that he's just pissing off lots of people and that the stuff that a lot of the stuff that he's doing and drawing attention toward is really quite unpopular. There's also this reality of the coalitional realignment you were talking about at the beginning, which is Democrats now have this higher information, higher engagement coalition. Those are the people who turn out to midterms disproportionately. If I were a moderate Republican right now or a Republican in any way vulnerable, I know they're all afraid of Elon Musk and they're afraid of primaries. I'd be pretty afraid of losing, because it's not just that you tend to have thermostatic midterm elections, but that the coalitions have been changing such that Democrats are able to survive the 2022 midterm, which should have gone against them. And I think Dobbs saved them to some degree. But also the fact that their coalition was as you showed earlier. If only 20, 22 voters had come out in 2024, Harris would have won. You got to be pretty confident in Donald Trump's political skills to think that he is going to shift that dynamic. It seems that in addition to all the normal things that happens to presidents and midterms, the shape of the coalition makes midterms harder right now for Republicans. Yeah, I think that's exactly right. But that said, it gets to this tension in all of these Democratic soul searching conversations, which is if Democrats do nothing really like, they'll probably be O.K in 2026 because all of these voters, who get their news from TikTok, who don't care about politics, these voters under 25, they just really are not going to vote very much in the midterms. But if we don't fix this problem, then four years from now, we could be in the same trust deficit on all of these core issues. And these voters that didn't turn out in 2026 will come back. And except we'll be running against a candidate who's a lot less unpopular, potentially, than Trump. And we could be in a real problem, a real, real pickle. How about the Senate. So you and I did a big piece on debates about populism a couple years ago, involved a model that you had, and that model was predicting in 2022, but specifically 2024 Democratic Senate annihilation. And Democrats are down a couple of seats in the Senate. It's what is it, 5347 right. It's not a good map for them in 2026. And they did lose some seats that were really important to them tester and Montana and Brown in Ohio. How do you see the Democratic Senate future. If you had told me in 2019, when I started worrying about the 2024 Senate election, that we would have 47 seats, I would have jumped for joining me. I think the really big factors there is they Republicans ran a bunch of really terrible candidates in a bunch of swing races. And it turns out Democrats, those Democratic candidates, did a good job of distancing themselves from the party. I don't want to spend too much time speculating about the 2026 map, but I think that even though the bias in the electoral college has gone down quite a bit because of this swing among immigrants that doesn't really change that. The Senate, it's very hard for Democrats to take the Senate unless they can consistently outperform how Harris did and how Biden did in most of the country. These problems won't be fixed unless we spend the next two years or four years, changing the party's brand among working class voters who are overrepresented in the Senate. The one exception to this, I think and this is just controversial and might get me in trouble is I think that I'm just going to scroll up back to the Senate side. If you look in Nebraska, the single biggest overperformance that we had was Osborne running as an independent. He outperformed at the top of the ticket by 7.1 percent Now obviously, Nebraska is an extremely red state. And I think that we've only ever tried this strategy of running people who are literally formally not tied to the Democratic Party in extremely red states. But I think the argument for doing that kind of thing in an merely red states, in places like Florida or places like Ohio or Iowa. Those are hard questions. And it's not up to me, what we end up doing, but I think it's something that we have to really seriously consider. And then that also just brings up the really awkward point of like, well, what do we do with the reality that in most by land area, in most parts of the country, it's almost impossible for a Democrat or someone with a Democrat on their ticket to win. What do you do about the reality of the Democratic brand is toxic in. Yeah most of the land area in the country, because I think you can have this conversation that you always have to be careful about which conversation you're having is a conversation. Can Democrats win in 2026 or 2028? And the answer there is Yes. If the conversation is how do you get back to a place where you're putting states in play that Democrats have just kind of given up on. Mitch McConnell is retiring in Kentucky. There's a Democratic Governor in Kentucky. It's not literally true that no Democrat can ever win there. I don't think anybody seriously thinks so that a Democrat is going to win Mitch McConnell's seat, because the Democratic brand nationally, which is different than it's kind of state party brand, is pretty bad. And people understand when they're voting for Senate, they're voting for the National brand. So you been thinking about this for a long time. If you were trying to think about reversing these much deeper trends, right. These educational trends, this realignment that has. If your whole point in life was to make Democrats competitive again in Florida, in Missouri, in Kansas. Not the reddest states, but states that they were competitive in a couple of years ago. What would you advise Democrats to do. The reality of the situation right now, I think there are these big theoretical discussions we could have about what positions the Democrats could take. Is that Democrats are not in power right now. And so we don't have agenda control. And I think a lot of this just depends on what Trump does and what. And then who replaces Trump. Something I'll say going back to the 2016 the first time that Trump was president is that when we were looking at polling of non-college whites and these obama-trump voters, their approval rating for Trump was really very stable for most of his term. And the only time that it declined was when Trump tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And then we saw them revert to their old partisanship. But once that was out of the news, they switched back. And so I think that does kind of like at this moment, given that there is no party leader. I think it's mostly a question of if Trump does successfully push a bunch of welfare state cuts, then that might change the realignment. But I think realistically, at least until 2026, it's mostly a function of what Republicans do. But when we pick a new presidential candidate that will be a that will be a reset. And I think I don't think it's too early to talk about that, but I think that could imagine us picking candidates who would do a much better job. I think that is a good place to end. So always our final question. What are three books you would recommend to the audience. I'd say the three books for me, I want to call out hollow parties by Danny Salzman. He's a good friend of mine, and I think it's. And Sam rosenfelt and Sam Rosenfeld, of course, my old colleague. Yes I think it's hard to talk about a lot of these questions that I was kind of dodging about why parties were doing what they did without kind of reading that. The other thing I want to call out is something that was hugely influential for how I think about politics is a really nerdy pick, but the origin and nature of mass opinion by Xolair. It gets at this question of how much does what people say in surveys matter versus how much of it is downstream of what people are saying what elites are saying. And I think his answer is mostly elites, but both. And then the last thing I just wanted to call out was a victory lap by Sasha Eisenberg.

      "text": "Donald Trump, Producer-in-Chief\n\nOn Monday, Donald Trump attended his first board meeting at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts since installing himself as its chairman and firing its leadership. During the session, he surveyed board members about which musical was better-\"Les Misérables\" or \"The Phantom of the Opera\"-and reminisced at length about seeing the 1982 Broadway première of \"Cats\" from a fourth-row seat that he'd been given. \"They were treating me good because I was a young star,\" he theorized, while strongly implying that he had attended the play with someone other than his wife. He fondly recalled the \"gorgeous\" young dancers lying onstage and the brilliance of the star singer, Betty Buckley. \"Is Betty Buckley still alive?\" he asked, mid-soliloquy. (She is, and is not a Trump fan .) The point, such as it was, seemed to be that he wanted to have a lot more \"Cats\"-style shows at the Kennedy Center, and a lot fewer of the \"totally woke\" modern productions that one of his fellow MAGA board members complained about during the meeting. Getting down to business, Trump volunteered to host a revamped version of the Kennedy Center Honors, minus the \"radical-left lunatics\" who had been given the prestigious award in recent years. This, he assured the board, would be good for the center, since he is \"the king of ratings, right?\"\n\nWe know the President of the United States said all this because someone had the presence of mind to secretly tape this inanity and send it to a reporter at the Times . As scoops go, the news value might have been minimal, but the illumination value was high-this is Trump as he sees himself, a brilliant showman who once dreamed of being a Broadway producer, an avatar of middle-brow theatrics indifferent to the arbiters of good taste and trapped in a vision of America rooted in his nineteen-eighties heyday. If the crowd loved it, then so did he. The great Times photographer Doug Mills captured Trump during his Kennedy Center visit, standing on the balcony of the Presidential box, staring down at the orchestra below in a pose that evoked his all-time favorite Andrew Lloyd Webber show, \"Evita.\" This was no accident. C- SPAN footage shows that Trump produced the shot himself, directing Mills and others to come and get it. \"Do you want a little picture like this?\" he called down to the journalists. \"Perfect,\" one responded.\n\nAll week, I've thought of this scene while watching the others that Trump has orchestrated daily for our national consumption, all of which feature Trump as a sort of Presidential action hero: ordering the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gangbangers in a dramatic Saturday-evening operation accompanied by a made-for-TV music video; leading a social-media mob against the federal judge who ordered a stop to the operation in order to make sure it was legal; conducting overhyped negotiations about a so-called peace deal with a Russian dictator who wants no such thing; signing an order to dismantle a congressionally authorized federal department during a glitzy White House celebration of his unchecked power. This is what it means to have a self-styled \"king of ratings\" as our Producer-in-Chief. There is, in fact, real stagecraft along with the buffoonery. The new gold fixtures in the redone Oval Office, which he proudly showed off to Fox News' Laura Ingraham, are as important to his second-term agenda as his relentless attacks on unelected bureaucrats, out-of-control liberal judges, and trans people using their preferred bathroom. The revolution-or, in this case, the culture war-must be televised.\n\nThe havoc that Trump has wreaked on America, and the rest of the world, in his eight weeks back in office requires some restraint in the deployment of this analogy. It's not right to call what Trump is doing a mere show. His actions, after all, have put thousands of federal-government employees out of work with little regard for what they do or what it will mean when they are no longer around to do it. It's not a show when the vast majority of American assistance to the poor, displaced, and hungry in the rest of the world disappears overnight . When trials for lifesaving cancer drugs end abruptly. When the supply line keeping Ukraine's military in the fight against Russian invaders is peremptorily halted after an Oval Office meeting gone bad . For too many years, Trump has benefitted from the tendency to view his political career through the lens of theatre criticism, which has the effect of downplaying the threat that he poses by casting him as a blowhard who craves the spotlight but cares little for what happens when the cameras are off. I'm thinking here of all the Wall Street types who thought Trump would never follow through on his tariff threats, or the establishment Republicans who have spent years insisting Trump would never abandon America's allies in favor of dictatorial adversaries.\n\nIt's true that a bigger bullshit artist has never occupied our public stage. But focussing on the spectacle at the expense of understanding what Trump and his allies are actually doing has led to some of the most epically wrong takes in the history of American politics. \"What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?\" one senior Republican official famously mused to a Washington Post reporter in November of 2020, as Trump refused to give up his false claims about his election defeat. \"He went golfing this weekend. It's not like he's plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on Jan. 20.\"\n\nStill, I'd say, ignore the Presidential performance art at your peril. There is no Trumpology that matters without taking it into account. This second term requires a new understanding: the showman is not at odds with the would-be strongman but his accomplice. Trump is neither one nor the other-he is both, always and forever. Welcome to \"Trump! the Musical.\" Performances are daily. Matinées, too. There is never a down day.\n\nIn just the past week of the Trump restoration, the President has signed an executive order that aims to dismantle the congressionally authorized Department of Education, despite no law allowing him to do so. He has effectively shuttered the Voice of America and its affiliates Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe, silencing one of the country's main tools for countering authoritarian propaganda overseas. He has invoked a centuries-old, rarely used wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to justify deportations without any due process, such as this past weekend's flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members. He has sent ultimatums to two Ivy League universities-Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania-to change their policies or lose hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, a sweeping attack on higher education without precedent since the era of McCarthyism .\n\nWhat's striking is not just that Trump is picking so many fights across such a broad front but that he's doing so on purpose. These are not battles he's blundered into but enemies he's eager to confront-the more publicly, the better. The show, in other words, is very much of his making. After the U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg confronted the Trump Administration over its deportation flights to El Salvador this weekend, Trump personally waded into the fray. In a social-media post on Tuesday, he called the judge \"a troublemaker and agitator\" who was taking the side of \"VICIOUS, VIOLENT, AND DEMENTED CRIMINALS, MANY OF THEM DERANGED MURDERERS.\" Impeach him, Trump demanded. The MAGA chorus-the Elon Musks and Marco Rubios, the backbench congressmen and prime-time Fox hosts, the tweeters and the Truthers-immediately took up his cry. The producer was producing again, and this time he has the cast that he wants.\n\nBut there comes a point in every day when even Musk leaves Trump's side, if only to go play video games for a while.

      "searched_phrase": "Donald Trump",

      "text": "Even Donald Trump's Historical Role Model Had Second Thoughts About Tariffs\n\nThe other morning, as Donald Trump was writing on social media that the \"Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!\" and threatening to impose tariffs of two hundred per cent on wine and champagne from the European Union, and as investors were fretting about the possibility of his actions plunging the economy into a recession, I happened to be reading a biography of another tariff-raising Republican whom Trump has adopted as a role model: the Ohioan William McKinley, who served as President from March, 1897, until his assassination, in September, 1901, at the hands of an anarchist. Last year, Trump said that McKinley \"made this country rich.\" On Trump's first day back in office, in January, he reinstated Mt. McKinley as the name of an Alaskan mountain that is the highest peak in North America.\n\nIn \" President McKinley: Architect of the American Century ,\" which was published in 2017, the journalist and author Robert W. Merry recounts how McKinley started out as a \"steadfast protectionist\" who believed that high tariff walls were a prerequisite for the rapid growth of the U.S. economy in the decades following the Civil War. In 1890, when McKinley was serving as the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, he sponsored a tariff bill that raised the duties on many imported goods to nearly fifty per cent on average. Sounding like a modern-day Trumpian economic nationalist, he declared on the House floor, \"This bill is an American bill. It is made for the American people and American interests.\" Seven years later, when McKinley was in the Oval Office, he signed into law a piece of legislation, the Dingley Act, that raised some tariffs even further.\n\nMcKinley also presided over the Spanish-American War of 1898, and the subsequent acquisitions of Hawaii, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam as U.S. territories. It's hardly surprising that Trump, a self-proclaimed \"tariff man\" and a would-be American imperialist, seized on McKinley as a role model. But a closer inspection of McKinley's trade policy reveals some surprises and warnings for Trump-supporting members of Congress who are up for reëlection in less than twenty months. In purloining a simplistic version of McKinley's attitudes toward tariffs, Trump is ignoring the valuable lessons they have to offer.\n\nSince the days of Alexander Hamilton, the United States had imposed customs on imported goods to encourage local production and raise revenues. Throughout the nineteenth century, the dividing line on trade policy was largely geographic. In the South, planters and other agricultural interests who exported crops to world markets were generally supportive of open trade and low tariff rates. In the North, where new manufacturing industries faced stiff competition from European (and particularly British) imports, many business interests supported higher tariffs.\n\nBy the time McKinley entered Congress, in 1877, industrialization was accelerating rapidly, and his home state, long dependent on agriculture, was emerging as a major center for the mining of coal and the production of iron and steel. McKinley was the son of an iron-foundry owner, and his electoral district encompassed some of Ohio's biggest industrial centers. In the long run, industrialization and migration would transform American politics, but for now the Republican Party remained the primary representative of Northern industrialists, and the Democratic Party largely depended on the South.\n\nAfter arriving on Capitol Hill, McKinley advocated for higher tariffs. Back then, Congress determined trade policy: it wouldn't be until the nineteen-thirties that it delegated the responsibility for making trade deals and adjusting tariff rates to the President. The postwar government was still fiercely divided, and McKinley didn't get the opportunity to pass any trade legislation until after the election of 1888, when Republicans won control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nThus empowered, McKinley drew up a bill that raised or maintained import duties on a broad range of manufactured goods, including woollens, cottons, earthenware, iron, steel, and metal products. Democrats claimed that the McKinley Tariff Act, as it came to be known, would gouge ordinary Americans and provoke foreign countries to retaliate. They portrayed McKinley as a captive of his wealthy industrialist allies, who included Mark Hanna, the Cleveland iron-and-steel magnate. The Republicans largely dismissed these objections, and, on October 1, 1890, President Benjamin Harrison signed the tariff bill into law. The midterms were just a month away.\n\n\"The Democrats had supporters of the tariff on the defensive,\" the historian Richard J. Jensen wrote in his book \" The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888-96 .\" \"Young party workers peddled wagonloads of tinware from house to house, asking fifty cents for twenty-five-cent items, and explained to dismayed housewives that McKinley's tariffs had doubled the price of tin.\" Rallying to McKinley's side, other Republican leaders insisted that the tariffs bearing his name would protect workers' jobs. Harrison and his Secretary of State, James G. Blaine, visited McKinley's district and gave campaign speeches, but their efforts were to no avail. On Election Night, the Republicans suffered heavy losses across the country. McKinley was one of the victims.\n\nTo be sure, other factors played into this outcome. In the case of McKinley, redistricting changes had boosted the number of Democrats in his district. At the time, however, it was generally believed that public anger at the new tariffs was a major reason for the G.O.P. wipeout. In his sweeping 2017 history of U.S. trade policy, \" Clashing Over Commerce ,\" the Dartmouth economist Douglas A. Irwin points out that Theodore Roosevelt, who was then an ambitious young Republican politician, subscribed to this view. When, in 1901, Roosevelt succeeded McKinley as President, he would follow his predecessor's lead on U.S. imperialism, but he would also steer away from tariffs.\n\nIrwin's book also highlights another fact about the McKinley Tariff Act that should worry latter-day protectionists in the Trump Administration. In the years after the law was enacted, the U.S. economy entered a deep slump, which didn't fully relent until 1897. Non-trade factors played the primary role in bringing about this calamity, particularly a big financial panic in 1893, which led to the collapse of a number of banks and railroads. Still, as Irwin noted when I called him up last week: \"When President Trump says that the McKinley tariff ushered in this glorious period of industrial expansion, it was actually a recession, really a depression, for a number of years.\"\n\nA third important fact about McKinley's record that Trump ignores is that his views on trade were far from static. When he ran successfully for President, in 1896, he was still a supporter of high tariffs-his Democratic opponent, William Jennings Bryan, had called for less restrictive policies-but his views were changing, an evolution that the economic slump seems to have accelerated. McKinley \"could see that America's burgeoning industrialism was outstripping American consumer demand, and prosperity in the postdepression era that would define his presidency would require an active American pursuit of foreign markets,\" Merry writes in his biography.\n\nIn his March, 1897, Inaugural Address, McKinley highlighted the \"reciprocity principle,\" which he said involved \"the opening up of new markets for the products of our country, by granting concessions to the products of other lands,\" by which he meant reducing or removing the barriers to imports. Four months later, he signed legislation that appeared to contradict this principle: the Dingley Act raised the average rate on dutiable goods to as high as fifty-two per cent for a time. But the most egregious elements of this legislation came about because of uber-protectionists in the Senate. Merry writes that, in fact, McKinley \"harbored some disappointment at many of the law's high duties,\" and took consolation from the fact that the bill also bestowed upon him some limited power to reach reciprocal trade agreements with foreign countries. The following year, the White House announced a deal with France in which the French duties on American exports of a range of goods, including fruits, pork, and building materials, would be set at a minimum rate in return for a reduction of U.S. tariffs on French goods, including wines, spirits, and paintings.\n\nThis agreement, and others like it, didn't do very much to mitigate the high tariffs imposed by the McKinley and Dingley Acts. But McKinley, as he entered his second term, in 1901, seemed sincere in his belief that new circumstances demanded new, less restrictive trade policies. Speaking in Buffalo on September 5th, the day before he was fatally shot, he acknowledged some of the benefits that the U.S. economy derived from trade, saying, \"A system which provides a mutual exchange of commodities, a mutual exchange, is manifestly essential to the continued and healthful growth of our export trade. We must not repose in fancied security that we can forever sell everything and buy little or nothing. . . . We should take from our customers such of their products as we can use.\" Further distancing himself from the harsh protectionist language he had employed earlier in his political career, he went on, \"Commercial wars are unprofitable. A policy of good will and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times, measures of retaliation are not.\"\n\nTrump claims to be in favor of reciprocity. The White House is already describing an extensive proposal of new levies, which he is expected to impose in early April, as \"reciprocal tariffs.\" But Trump's definition of reciprocity is a peculiar one. \"Under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, we already have reciprocity with Canada and Mexico,\" Irwin pointed out to me. \"Trump cut that deal in his first term, and he seems to be walking away from it. Japan doesn't have a tariff on imported automobiles. Should we match that? He seems to want to raise tariffs rather than lower them.\"\n\nSome people in the Trump Administration deny that Trump's goal is permanently higher tariffs. Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, famously remarked that Trump's strategy is \"escalate to de-escalate.\" But Irwin, for one, is skeptical of this rationalization. \"It's all threats about raising tariffs,\" he said, of Trump's messaging. \"Ultimately, since he hasn't done much about reciprocity, and he keeps talking about the benefits of tariffs, it seems like tariffs are the endgame.\" Meanwhile, some widely watched economic indicators are showing weakness. Last week, the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers reported that consumer confidence has fallen for the third month in a row, and expectations of inflation have reached their highest level since 2022. Whatever impact Trump's tariffs and tariff threats are having on U.S. trading partners, they seem to be alarming many ordinary Americans.\n\nMcKinley had gone to Buffalo, near the Canadian border, to speak at the Pan-American Exposition, an elaborate fair that was intended to celebrate the growth of countries in the Americas and foster commerce between them. Finishing up his fateful last address, he said, \"Our earnest prayer is that God will graciously vouchsafe prosperity, happiness and peace to all our neighbors, and like blessings to all the people and powers of earth.\" Obviously, these words don't erase McKinley's record of protectionism and imperialism. But can anybody imagine Trump saying them? ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Month One of Donald Trump's \"Golden Age\"\n\nIt seemed as if the inaugural festivities had barely ended by the time the first articles of impeachment were introduced. Al Green, a congressman from Texas, brought them \"for dastardly deeds proposed and dastardly deeds done.\" (\"They are still a work in progress,\" Green's press secretary added.) Donald Trump had been President for two weeks, and Washington was flailing to respond to the new Administration's tactics, which were to \"flood the zone with shit,\" as Steve Bannon once put it. The notion of a President's first hundred days was a quaint, bygone metric; this White House released a memo commemorating the first hundred hours of Trump's second term-the \"kick off\" for America's new era. Trump had promised to retake the Panama Canal and to possibly acquire Greenland , imposed a barrage of tariffs , fired more than a dozen inspectors general and federal prosecutors , suggested shutting down FEMA , halted global land-mine-clearance programs, and ordered migrants to Guantánamo Bay. For every new regulation proposed, ten would be repealed.\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\n\"I'm getting really tired of winning,\" a consultant said to me the weekend after Trump was sworn in. He had convened a mixer for aspiring Administration workers and D.C. newcomers; many in the room were hungover and sniffling, in the early stages of a post-Inauguration flu. A political strategist who attended one of the inaugural balls referred to half-joking speculation, stoked by the podcaster Shawn Ryan, that China had released a \"brain-fog bioweapon\" into the ballroom. \"Everyone I know is suffering from this right now,\" he said. Government Web sites were going dark, egg prices went so high they became a meme, and dead bodies were being pulled out of the river in Washington. But nothing would impede Trump's \"golden age,\" as he kept calling it. Members of Congress ate smashburgers emblazoned with the word \" TRUMP \" at a Party retreat held at the President's golf club in Doral, Florida; one lawmaker had proposed a constitutional amendment that would allow the President to seek a third term. Trump often raised the issue himself. \"They say I can't run again,\" he had recently mused. \"Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Ooh . . .\"\n\n\"Welcome to the circus,\" one reporter said to another, as we waited in the White House briefing room. It was January 30th, and Trump was about to hold his first press conference as President. The night before, a Black Hawk helicopter had collided with an American Airlines jet about to land at Reagan National Airport; there was an explosion in the sky as both aircraft plunged into the Potomac. All sixty-seven people on board were killed.\n\nTrump's rants often open with a brief gesture at unity. After taking the podium, he asked for a moment of silence for the victims and families. \"Real tragedy,\" he said. \"This was a dark and excruciating night . . . that icy, icy Potomac. It was a cold, cold night, cold water.\" He went on, \"We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas, and I think we'll probably state those opinions now.\" He suggested that the crash had happened because people with \"psychiatric disabilities,\" \"complete paralysis,\" and \"dwarfism\" were being hired at the Federal Aviation Administration. \"Not your fault!\" he said to Sean Duffy, his newly confirmed Secretary of Transportation.\n\nThe woman in front of me, who wore a sparkly pantsuit and sneakers, was making a shaky video on Facebook Live, occasionally switching to selfie view. She blew a kiss to her phone camera. \"It's nice to have a real President,\" the guy next to her whispered. The man on my other side was texting, \"Who are these bozos.\" Trump's press secretary had opened the briefing room to \"new media,\" such as podcasters and influencers. \"I'm amidst the establishment,\" Natalie Winters, the White House correspondent for Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast, told me. \"It's like segregation has ended. I've taken their sacred space.\" Diver teams were still searching for bodies in the freezing river. \"I can't imagine people with 20/20 vision not seeing what's happening up there,\" Trump said.\n\nOn February 4th, Trump announced that the U.S. would take a \"long-term ownership position\" in Gaza, which he called the \"Riviera of the Middle East .\" The next day, Democratic lawmakers were protesting outside U.S.A.I.D. headquarters. Elon Musk and his DOGE team had spent the weekend feeding the agency, which provides international humanitarian aid and development assistance, \"into the wood chipper,\" as he put it on X. Employees were now locked out of the building. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Minority Leader, admitted early on that Democrats would need to be judicious about their resistance; they were being overwhelmed by executive actions and shocking appointments at a rate designed to force them into submission. The U.S.A.I.D. protest felt a little late; soon after it ended, workers scaled the building to remove the large metal letters that spelled out the agency's name, pulling them off one by one and leaving them in a pile, like a used arts-and-crafts project. In the mostly empty federal plaza, a woman yelled, \"Shame!\"\n\nA half mile or so down the road, at the White House, Trump was in the East Room, sitting at a wooden desk, with rows of school-age girls and coaches standing behind him. He was preparing to sign an executive order called \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports,\" which sought to ban trans student athletes from women's and girls' athletic programs. He asked the group to gather around him. \"Every day, we're ending the extremism of the last four years,\" he said. He looked around at how crowded the room was. \"I actually offered to build a ballroom for the White House. . . . I offered to do it to the Biden Administration,\" he said. \"I'm going to try and make the offer to myself.\" The executive order, he said, was part of a \"sweeping effort to reclaim our culture.\" Everyone filed out as the Marine Corps band played \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump said that he would \"save a fortune for our country\" by putting a stop to unnecessary spending. \"We're going to bring back Presidential impoundment authority,\" he noted, at a rally last spring. \"Nobody knows what it is.\" Now, in office, he was doing it- refusing to spend money allocated by Congress for purposes enumerated in law. Journalists and elected officials were scrambling to understand the impoundment powers. PBS, in its primer: \"It's a concept that's normally so dry, so esoteric and so distanced from Americans' everyday lives that your eyes may start to water as you try to recall whether this was ever covered in school.\"\n\nOn February 6th, after an all-night vigil in the Senate, Democrats failed to prevent Russell Vought from being confirmed as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, which administers federal spending. Vought had previously led Project 2025 , the staffing and policy program that Trump and his allies denied association with during the campaign. Meanwhile, teachers and federal workers who had supported Trump posted on TikTok and Facebook Live in distress-U.S.D.A. food inspectors and National Park Service staffers, among others, hadn't realized how deep the cuts would be. Vought, in his policy writings and public speeches, has consistently promised to inflict \"trauma\" on the \"administrative state.\" The Constitution, he has written , is \"a revered document that is no longer in effect. . . . The Right needs to throw off the precedents and legal paradigms that have wrongly developed over the last two hundred years.\" The potential limits of Presidential authority weren't a concern. \"Everything we do is legal,\" he said recently.\n\nBefore sunrise, when Democrats were still holding the Senate floor in protest of Vought, people under umbrellas were streaming into the National Prayer Breakfast. The event originated the year before Dwight Eisenhower added \"under God\" to the Pledge of Allegiance. Trump announced that the spirit of the country was up forty-nine per cent. \"The spirit is as high as it's been,\" he said. \"That's the biggest increase in the history of whatever the poll was.\" He said that, after he was nearly shot in Butler, Pennsylvania , his own son Don, Jr., had \"gained some religion. . . . He went up twenty-five per cent. And, if you know him, that's a lot.\" Trump felt that the spirit of the country was \"probably the hardest thing to get back.\" He went on, \"The rest is easy. The rest is easy.\"\n\nThat evening, I ran into a neighbor and her husband coming home from a funeral. She had worked at U.S.A.I.D. and for the Treasury for decades. \"I'm watching thirty years of my career being destroyed,\" she said. \"It's all for nothing.\" A memo with the subject line \"Fork in the Road\" had gone out to most of the federal workforce, inviting resignations and laying out severance terms. Her husband, a longtime federal employee, told me that he had taken the offer. Across the government, chaos and confusion took hold as the deadline approached. There were happy hours all over town with drink deals for federal workers trying to sort through it; many also took to Reddit: \"Did anyone accepting the Resignation not receive confirmation?\" \"Does anyone know if the VA is still keeping a dedicated lactation space or have we loosened those reigns given the recent shots fired at DEI and such?\" \"Who now has access to our DNA Profiles?\"\n\nOthers seemed to welcome the old order being thrown to the wood chipper. \"Trump may have saved my career,\" a friend, who is a federal employee, texted me. She had wanted to leave her job forever. She sent the \"resign\" e-mail, and received a confirmation note addressed to another person's name. \"I hope she wanted to resign, too,\" she laughed.\n\nOn February 7th, I went to the White House, where Trump was hosting Shigeru Ishiba, the Japanese Prime Minister. The night before, a twenty-five-year-old DOGE staffer named Marko Elez had resigned after the Wall Street Journal found some of his old social-media posts. (\"Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool\" ; \"Normalize Indian hate.\") As we waited to be let into the East Room, Musk was collecting results from an X poll about whether to bring Elez back. (Eighty per cent of the hundreds of thousands of respondents voted to rehire him.) Vice-President J. D. Vance replied to Musk, \"We shouldn't reward journalists who try to destroy people. Ever. So I say bring him back.\" Musk posted a saluting-face emoji, adding, \"He will be brought back. To err is human, to forgive divine.\"\n\nTrump and Ishiba began their press conference, and a reporter asked, \"Is there anything you've told Elon Musk he cannot touch?\" Trump replied, \"We haven't discussed that much. . . . I think everything is fertile.\" Democratic congressmen had just sent letters to Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, expressing outrage that DOGE engineers had access to Treasury payment systems, which contain personal information such as Social Security numbers. Why did DOGE even need that? \"Well, it doesn't,\" Trump said. \"But they get it very easily. I mean, we don't have very good security in our country, and they get it very easily.\"\n\nThe lingering question, ever since Musk showed up in the Trump family photo at Mar-a-Lago just after the election, has been when his new friendship with the President will go sour . (Musk spent much of the first weeks of the transition at Trump's Palm Beach club; when he left, Trump wrote, on Truth Social, \"Where are you? When are you coming to the 'Center of the Universe,' Mar-a-Lago. Bill Gates asked to come, tonight. We miss you and x! New Year's Eve is going to be AMAZING!!! DJT.\") In Trump's first term, Bannon, then his chief strategist, appeared on the cover of Time . Trump was displeased; Bannon left the White House soon after. Now Musk was on the Time cover , cast as President Musk, behind the Resolute desk. Trump was in the Oval Office with Ishiba when a reporter asked how he felt about it. He paused. \"Is Time magazine still in business?\" he asked, despite having recently sat for a photo shoot with the publication. \"Elon is doing a great job.\" Musk tweeted , \"I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.\"\n\nOn the way back to Washington from the Super Bowl, Trump ordered the Treasury-in a post on Truth Social-to stop minting new pennies. By then, there was such an onslaught of calls to congressional offices that phone lines on the Hill were jammed to the point of failure. On February 10th, Trump was in the Oval Office getting rid of paper straws. \"I don't think that plastic is going to affect a shark very much as they are eating, as they are munching their way through the ocean,\" he said. On the first day of his term, Trump had ended remote work for the entire federal government; the morning he signed the straw order, cars sat in standstill traffic all the way across the bridge to Navy Yard, which was short five thousand parking spaces. On Fed Reddit, some wondered if Musk would make Tesla-only lanes to reduce congestion.\n\nOn February 11th, Musk joined Trump in the Oval Office. Musk had been holed up in the Secretary of War Suite of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building for several weeks, communicating with the public mostly by posting online. Now Trump wanted him to meet the press. The President presided grandly from behind the Resolute desk, with Musk standing to the side, his hands clasped in front of his chest. Musk's four-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii (he goes by X), stood in front of him, in a tan coat. X was making sounds with his mouth. Trump turned to the boy. \"X, are you O.K.? This is X, and he's a great guy, high-I.Q. individual.\" The President asked Musk to speak, like one member of a science-fair group project turning to his geek partner to explain the details.\n\n\"At a high level, you say, What is the goal of DOGE ? And I think a significant part of this Presidency is to restore democracy,\" Musk said. \"Are we in a democracy?\" His son interrupted by burbling. \"I tell you, gravitas can be difficult sometimes,\" Musk joked to the reporters. \"If there's not a good feedback loop from the people to the government,\" he said, \"and if you have rule of the bureaucrat, if the bureaucracy is in charge, then what meaning does democracy actually have?\" Trump tried to nudge him toward some actual news items. \"Could you mention some of the things that your team has found, some of the crazy numbers?\"\n\nMusk's favorite anecdote was about an old limestone mine in Pennsylvania that was now used by the contractor Iron Mountain to process retirement paperwork for the federal workforce. He started on what was almost his own version of the classic Trump weave, like when the President gets going on dishwashers or showerheads at a rally:\n\nWe were told the most number of people that could retire, possibly in a month, is ten thousand. . . . Why is that? Well, because all the retirement paperwork is manual, on paper. It's manually calculated, then written down on a piece of paper. Then it goes down a mine. I'm like, \"What do you mean, a mine?\" Like, yeah, there's a limestone mine where we store all the retirement paperwork. You look at a picture of this mine. We'll post some pictures afterwards. This mine looks like something out of the fifties because it was started in 1955. It looks like it's, like, a time warp. And then the speed-the limiting factor is the speed-at which the mine-shaft elevator can move determines how many people can retire from the federal government. And the elevator breaks down sometimes, and then nobody can retire. Doesn't that sound crazy?\n\nMusk's son made his way onto his shoulders, pulling at his father's Dark MAGA cap. \"Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,\" Musk said. \"I thought my son might enjoy this, but he's sticking his fingers in my ears and stuff.\" After the meeting ended, Steve Cheung, the White House communications director, posted a collage of media coverage the meeting had generated: \"FULL SPECTRUM DOMINANCE.\"\n\nThat night, it snowed. Secret Service dogs took to the White House lawn to practice catching snowballs in their mouths. \"There's a sense we're living through times we'll understand only in retrospect,\" Peggy Noonan had recently written in the Journal . At a party on Embassy Row, I talked to a person who said that he hoped to soon get a job in the Administration. He told me, \"Other than this idea of who is a citizen of this nation, which I think will change, this whole thing is almost more like a conceptual art movement than politics. Or like pornography-you know it when you see it.\"\n\nThere was growing debate among legal scholars and journalists about whether the country was in a constitutional crisis. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, came to the briefing room to offer another view. \"Many outlets in this room have been fearmongering the American people,\" she said. \"In fact, the real constitutional crisis is taking place within our judicial branch, where district-court judges in liberal districts across the country are abusing their power to unilaterally block President Trump's basic executive authority.\" States were launching constant legal challenges against Trump's actions, hoping to win nationwide injunctions. A conservative law clerk had told me, \"It seems like the courts will have legitimate action. They can pause things for fourteen days. So it just messes up our momentum.\"\n\nOn Valentine's Day, White House staff came through the press area to pass out long bulleted lists of the week's achievements. The Administration had just fired hundreds of employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration, not realizing that they oversaw the country's nuclear-weapons stockpile. An article from ZeroHedge, a right-wing blog, cited an apparent surge in certain Internet search terms to show that \"political elites were in panic mode\": \"Washington DC searches soar for 'Swiss bank', 'offshore bank', 'wire money.' . . . Search terms 'Wipe' and 'Erase' also moved higher in recent weeks. Wipe hard drives? Well, yes, the search term 'wipe hard drive' across the DC metro has gone absolutely parabolic.\" The following week, the official White House Instagram account posted a video of ICE agents shackling deportees. (The only sound in the video is the roar of airplane engines and the clinking of chains; the caption was \"ASMR.\") Outside the Kennedy Center, protesters performed a series of an anti-Trump interpretive dances.\n\nEarly one morning, a Trump supporter posted a video of the White House: \"He's already up working. 5:30am. Oval Office lights on. Sun isn't even up yet.\" The lights in the video weren't from the Oval Office. It almost didn't matter that it wasn't true-even supporters whose own lives had not materially improved in the way they'd hoped since Trump took office said that they loved what it all stood for. An R.N.C. delegate in Pennsylvania, whom I'd met early in the campaign, told me that he hadn't been tracking the Presidency too closely, but he knew that Trump was going to release the Kennedy-assassination files, and that was enough. \"Guess what? This country has not been told the truth,\" he said. \"It's a new time for openness and transparency.\" He went on, \"Everything's been on the up and up, other than the plane crashes.\" A former Trump-caucus captain told me he just wished there were more mass deportations.\n\nOn Presidents' Day weekend, the crowd at the Daytona 500 cheered as Trump took a lap of the speedway in his motorcade. He had pinned a new post on Truth Social, a quotation sometimes attributed to Napoleon: \"He who saves his country does not violate any law.\" At the one-month mark of his Presidency, Trump hosted a Black History Month event in the East Room. \"Should I run again?\" he asked the attendees. \"What do you think?\" They chanted, \"Four more years.\" The day before, Trump had written online, in reference to himself, \"LONG LIVE THE KING!\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Why John Mearsheimer Thinks Donald Trump Is Right on Ukraine\n\nJust over three years ago, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, and perhaps the most prominent \"realist\" foreign-policy scholar of his generation, made clear that he believed the blame for Russia's attack lay most prominently with the United States. This was not exactly a surprise. Since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and supported a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine, Mearsheimer has been arguing that the U.S. and much of Europe are the main cause of Russian aggression in the region, largely because NATO has continued to expand eastward across the Continent. (Since the end of the Cold War, sixteen countries have joined the alliance.) Mearsheimer and I talked twice in 2022 after Russia's invasion; both times, he castigated Western policy and defended Vladimir Putin from charges of imperialism and lying about his war aims. (That year, Mearsheimer visited Viktor Orbán , the autocratic Hungarian leader who has been sympathetic to Putin's narratives about the war.)\n\nWhen Joe Biden was President, and support for Ukraine was very strong in the U.S., Mearsheimer seemed like the odd man out. Now Donald Trump is back in power, and he has wooed Russia, stopped arming Ukraine, and publicly scolded Volodymyr Zelensky , Ukraine's President, during a meeting in the Oval Office. Trump's admiration for Putin hardly seems to fit into any grand geostrategic theory; nevertheless, Trump has been talking about the conflict in language that mirrors that of Mearsheimer, who is a strong critic of liberal internationalism, and is someone who believes it is natural for regional hegemons to exert dominance in their spheres of influence.\n\nMearsheimer and I recently spoke again by phone. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why he thinks Ukraine should not get any security guarantees as part of a peace deal, whether he was wrong about Russia's intentions prior to 2022, and why he still thinks Putin is misunderstood.\n\nHow well do you think Trump has been dealing with the issue of Russia and Ukraine?\n\nI basically agree with what he's doing. I think it makes good strategic sense to shut the war down immediately. I also think it's the morally correct thing to do. And, although Trump has not done it in the smoothest way possible, I think he is on the right path and hopefully will succeed.\n\nWhat is the right path?\n\nHe has to cut a deal with the Russians, and that means accepting the key terms that the Russians have laid on the table. One is that Ukraine has to be a genuinely neutral country. It can't be in NATO and can't have Western security guarantees. Two, it's going to have to give up a significant slice of territory in eastern Ukraine. And three, it's going to have to demilitarize to the point that it is not an offensive military threat to Russia. Trump has to accept those conditions and work out a deal with the Russians. But then comes the hard part, which is getting the Europeans and especially the Ukrainians to agree.\n\nWhat would this rump Ukraine look like?\n\nIt all depends on how much territory Ukraine loses between now and when the agreement is decided. The Russians have strategic incentives for taking more territory. So I think it's imperative, from a Ukrainian point of view, to settle this one quickly, before the Russians capture much more territory and it's impossible to dislodge them from that territory.\n\nLet's assume there's a peace deal and that Ukraine will have to cede territory. What guarantees do you think can or should be offered to Ukrainians who have been under attack from Russia in some form for a decade?\n\nThey can't have a security guarantee and they simply have to accept that fact.\n\nWhy?\n\nA security guarantee is basically de-facto membership in NATO , and the Russians won't accept that. Is this a tragic situation for Ukraine? The answer is yes. But what is the alternative?\n\nIf the Europeans, or even the Americans under a different Administration, perceived that it was in their self-interest to give Ukraine a security guarantee, why shouldn't they do so?\n\nThey can offer it, but the Russians will turn it down. I believe this war was all about NATO expansion. Giving Ukraine a security guarantee is effectively NATO membership.\n\nLet's say the peace deal is made and there's no security guarantee, and then Putin attacks Ukraine again. Then what?\n\nI think it would be a tragedy. The question is how best to avoid this. But will Putin attack Ukraine in the future? I do not believe he will. I think the last thing Putin would want once he settles this war is to start another war.\n\nIn 2014, you said that Putin would not go after the rest of Ukraine. Do you think maybe you are underestimating him again?\n\nNo. In 2014, I said he would not go after the rest of Ukraine. But the situation changed after 2014, and, in particular, it changed after Joe Biden moved into the White House. Biden was a superhawk on Ukraine. He began to arm Ukraine at a greater rate than his predecessor did. And the end result, not surprisingly, was that thirteen months after he moved into the White House, he got a war.\n\nSo Putin was sort of forced into the invasion?\n\nYes, that's my view. We forced Putin to launch a preventive war to stop Ukraine from becoming a member of NATO .\n\nIf Ukraine was a member of NATO , it wouldn't necessarily be a threat to Russia. I mean, maybe in Putin's mind it would be.\n\nBut that's all that matters. What you and I think doesn't matter. The Russians made it unequivocally clear from 2008 forward. And, remember, 2008 is when NATO announced that Ukraine would become a member of the alliance. Putin and his lieutenants made it unequivocally clear that that was an existential threat and they would not allow it to happen. Putin said that he would destroy Ukraine. This is in 2008.\n\nIs there a difference between saying that Putin views something a certain way, regardless of whether he is right or wrong, and that Putin got forced into invading another country?\n\nWell, he believes that Ukraine in NATO is an existential threat, and the equivalent of declaring war on Russia.\n\nUkraine was never a member of NATO . And it wasn't a certainty that Ukraine would ever be a member of NATO , even during the Biden Administration. Let's just be clear about that.\n\nNo, that's not true at all. In fact, if you look at what happened after Biden became President, he made it clear that he was committed to bringing Ukraine into NATO . There was a strategic-planning document.\n\nI realize that, but there have been talks about Ukraine and NATO for decades. There was no evidence it was actually going to happen. Diplomatic talk doesn't always mean something.\n\nI don't believe that.\n\nIt was taking a long time. You just said this was brought up in 2008.\n\nYes, in 2008, they said they were going to bring Ukraine into NATO .\n\nThat's my point. Fourteen years later, Ukraine was attacked. It was still not in NATO . Anyway, last year, you wrote , \"There is simply no evidence from before 24 February 2022 that Putin wanted to conquer Ukraine and incorporate it into Russia. Proponents of the conventional wisdom cannot point to anything Putin wrote or said that indicates he was bent on conquering Ukraine.\"\n\nI said that then and I believe it now.\n\nBack in 2014, you cast scorn on those who argued that Putin would \"eventually go after the rest of Ukraine.\" Didn't these people turn out to be correct? Why not give them credit? That's what I'm confused about.\n\nThere's no question they were proven correct. But, as I pointed out to you before, there was no evidence that he was going to invade Ukraine in 2014. The situation changes. After 2014, the United States and its European allies arm and train the Ukrainians. Ukraine is a much more formidable fighting force by 2021 than it was in 2014. It's more of a threat to Russia.\n\nIn a lot of your writings and interviews, you emphasize an article that Putin wrote on July 12, 2021. He writes, to Ukrainians, \"You want to establish a state of your own: you are welcome!\" Why the focus on this article and that line?\n\nThat article is used as proof by most supporters of the conventional wisdom that Putin was bent on conquering Ukraine before he invaded on February 24, 2022. It is the evidence that Putin was an imperialist.\n\nYes, in the same article, Putin also writes, \"Modern Ukraine is entirely the product of the Soviet era. We know and remember well that it was shaped-for a significant part-on the lands of historical Russia.\" He goes on, \"The wall that has emerged in recent years between Russia and Ukraine, between the parts of what is essentially the same historical and spiritual space, to my mind is our great common misfortune and tragedy.\"\n\nYes, that is basically what they point to, but that is not evidence that he thinks it is desirable to conquer Ukraine, that he thinks it's feasible to conquer Ukraine, or that he's going to conquer Ukraine. He's giving you his view of history, and nothing more.\n\nBut six months after the article came out he invaded Ukraine.\n\nOf course he did. But that is not evidence that he had a design on Ukraine.\n\nThen why is the one line you like to quote evidence of anything?\n\nBecause that shows that not only did he not have designs on Ukraine but that he believed Ukraine's future was up to the Ukrainian people. And that contradicts the argument that this document provides evidence that he wanted to conquer Ukraine, occupy it, and then annex it.\n\nSo all these quotes that I read from the document don't tell us anything, but this one line that you picked out does tell us something, even though Putin invaded Ukraine six months later?\n\nIn fact, Isaac, I could point to other lines.\n\nI saw a fascinating conversation you had recently with Alexander Dugin , the extreme right-wing Russian philosopher and writer who is a huge supporter of the war and of Russian nationalism. What was his perspective, and why did you feel that it offered support for your position that the war was about NATO expansion?\n\nWell, I have some fundamental agreements with Dugin about how the world works and some profound disagreements at the same time. In particular, my view of liberalism is the polar opposite of his view.\n\nYou're not a raging fascist.\n\nI'm not. In fact, as I have made clear on numerous occasions, I thank my lucky stars that I was born in liberal America, and I consider myself completely committed to liberalism. And he does not. The fact is we agree on what the principal cause of the Ukraine war is, and that was the attempt by the West to bring Ukraine into NATO . That was the basis of much of the discussion on the show that I did with him.\n\nIn his conversation with you, I thought he was relatively restrained. But I've looked at some other statements that he has made about the war in Ukraine. In March, 2022, during an interview with a Russian newspaper, he said, \"The siege of Kyiv is a battle for the unity of Eastern Slavs and the creation of a sovereign civilization of the Russian World, which is directed against the West.\" He said, \"We are waging an eschatological military operation, a special operation between Light and Darkness in the situation of the end of times.\" He said, \"Truth and God are on our side. We are fighting the absolute evil, embodied in Western civilization, its liberal-totalitarian hegemony, in Ukrainian Nazism.\" And he said that Russia's \"civilization\" will not \"be complete until we have united all Eastern Slavs and all Eurasian brothers into a common big space.\" Is it possible that these are the things Putin believes, too, regardless of what he says for public consumption?\n\nMany people would read what Dugin says and argue that it represents Putin's thinking. But there is no evidence that he is, as he has been called, \"Putin's brain.\" And my sense is that Putin is fully capable of figuring out how the world works on his own and making policy decisions on his own. So I don't think what Dugin says necessarily has any influence on Putin. Maybe it does, but who knows? But what Dugin's views are about what Russia should do, what Dugin's views are on how the world works-that's different than what his views are on why Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022.\n\nMy question is whether you are too trusting of Dugin. He's saying these things to you about NATO expansion, etc., but he's wanted to invade Ukraine for decades and incorporate it into Russia for imperialist reasons. It makes me think that maybe you're unwilling to hear similar types of things that contradict your view of Putin.\n\nLook, provide me with the evidence about Putin. That's the issue here. What Alexander Dugin writes and says is irrelevant. You're switching to talking about Alexander Dugin, which is largely irrelevant.\n\nPutin has talked about Peter the Great. \"What was [Peter] doing?\" he asked, in June, 2022. \"Taking back and reinforcing. That's what he did.\" He then said, \"And it looks like it fell on us to take back and reinforce as well,\" about returning land to Russia. You just blow these off?\n\nWhat he said about Peter the Great was after the war started. It was a throwaway comment. It is not evidence that he was determined to be aggressive before the war. You have not provided me with any evidence that Putin was an imperialist and that he was interested in conquering Ukraine and bringing it into greater Russia.\n\nIt seems like-\n\nIt was after the fact. It was a minor comment. In my world, that's not serious evidence.\n\nOther than Putin giving a speech in which he says, \"I am doing this for imperialist reasons,\" what would count as evidence?\n\nWell, there would have to be comments by him, either in writing or verbally, where he said that it was desirable to make Ukraine part of a greater Russia, where he said he thought it was feasible to do that, and where he made it clear that that's what he was doing.\n\nIt feels like the evidence for what Hitler wanted to do to Czechoslovakia was not what he said to Chamberlain at Munich; it was what he did to Czechoslovakia afterward.\n\nWell, that argument is not falsifiable. There's no evidence we could point to that Putin was bent on conquering Ukraine and integrating it into a greater Russia.\n\nHe is trying to do it now.\n\nNo, he's not. He's not trying to conquer all of Ukraine. There's no evidence of that. And, by the way, almost immediately after he invaded, in February, 2022, he reached out to the Ukrainian side with peace dealers and said, Let's have negotiations.\n\nI think there's a long history of people who are not sincerely interested in peace playing along and pretending they want peace negotiations. You write about the Middle East and criticize Israel constantly. I assume you have some awareness of countries that say that they're very interested in peace but, in fact, do not live up to that.\n\nAll the evidence is that Putin was deadly serious.\n\nYou said earlier that Ukraine was more of a threat to Russia in 2021 than it was in 2014. Was that you explaining Putin's views, or do you actually think Ukraine was a threat to Russia in 2021?\n\nMy point is that it was more formidable, and Putin perceived it to be more formidable.\n\nO.K., but do you actually feel that Ukraine was a threat to Russia?\n\nI think Ukraine in NATO was a threat to Russia. The Russians were not arguing that Ukraine by itself was a threat. It was Ukraine in NATO . As someone who believes in the Monroe Doctrine and does not want a great power in the Western Hemisphere, I agree with Putin's logic.\n\nYou are someone who talks about great-power politics and spheres of influence. I think of the Monroe Doctrine, which you just said you believe in, as imperialism. I'm therefore curious why you seem so resistant to imperialist readings of Russian behavior.\n\nI don't use the word imperialist because I associate imperialism with the great empires of the past centuries, like the British and the French and the Ottomans. This is just classic great-power politics. And as the United States and its allies march NATO up to Russia's borders, it's going to provoke a response.\n\nFor me, the imperialist argument today asserts that Putin was trying to conquer Ukraine so that he could incorporate it into a greater Russia. He was then going to take countries farther east and, if anything, not only make greater Russia bigger but reëstablish the Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe. And I don't think that argument is correct.\n\nI was going to point out that Putin reportedly told George W. Bush that Ukraine was \"not even a country\" back in 2008. But I assume you have an explanation for that.\n\nI don't know about that comment. I'd have to study it. I had not heard that before. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Trump's Putinization of America\n\nNo matter how many times Donald Trump openly parrots the Kremlin line, it's never not going to sound wrong coming from the President of the United States. In 2018, at a press conference in Helsinki, Trump announced that he accepted Vladimir Putin's claim that Russia did not intervene in American elections, despite our own intelligence agencies' conclusion to the contrary. I watched the scene sitting outside in the glaring Finnish summer sun on a CNN set, with Anderson Cooper, who, after a short, stunned silence, concluded, \"You have been watching perhaps one of the most disgraceful performances by an American President.\" Later, Fiona Hill, the National Security Council senior director who had staffed Trump at the summit, would recall what it felt like inside the room when she heard Trump's words: she thought about faking an illness, pulling a fire alarm, anything to stop him from talking.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a few hours after his foreign-policy team met in Riyadh with Russian officials to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine, the President had what can only be described as another Helsinki moment. Holding forth at a press conference at Mar-a-Lago about why he had refused to include the Ukrainians in the Saudi meeting, Trump said that there was no reason to have done so, since Russia's invasion, three years ago this week, was actually Ukraine's fault. \"You should never have started it,\" he said, addressing Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky . \"You could have made a deal.\" To hear Trump tell it, Ukraine might as well be bombing its own cities and killing its own citizens. He claimed that the United States had spent three hundred and fifty billion dollars helping Ukraine, and that Zelensky's popularity had plummeted to just four per cent in recent polls-both statements so far divorced from reality that Putin himself might not have been brazen enough to make them.\n\nBy Wednesday, Zelensky pushed back on Trump's ridiculous assertions by saying that he was living in a Russian-made \"disinformation space,\" and, in response, Trump attacked the Ukrainian leader as a \"Dictator without Elections\" in a long, falsehood-riddled social-media post. His officials, meanwhile, have made clear in the course of the last week that Trump's pro-Kremlin rhetoric is more than just empty words; he appears ready to concede to Russia on most of its major demands for a peace deal, including pledging that Ukraine will never join NATO , not allowing U.S. troops to participate in providing security for Ukraine after a ceasefire, pressuring Ukraine to cede illegally occupied territory to Russia, and lifting Western sanctions imposed on Russia. Trump's embrace of America's adversary and rejection of its ally has been so swift and complete that even top Kremlin officials are astonished. \"If you'd told me just three months ago that these were the words of the US president, I would have laughed out loud,\" the former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev posted on X.\n\nThat all this has taken place exactly one month into his second term seems fitting, however, for an American President who's never made much secret of his inexplicable desire to suck up to Putin. One difference from Trump's first four years in office, though, is that he has now adopted not only a pro-Putin take on Russia's conflict with Ukraine but an approach to foreign policy over all which echoes Putin's throwback view of the world, as a playground for predatory great powers to exert nearly unlimited control over the smaller nations that fall within their sphere of influence. How else to explain Trump's initial moves on the world stage since returning to office, as he threatened to outright seize territory in the Western Hemisphere, from Canada to Greenland and Panama? Surely he has been emboldened by Putin's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014-and one of many concessions Trump will now press on Ukraine is to admit that this territory has been lost to Russia forever. Trump's second Inaugural Address , in stark contrast to his first, even resurrected the nineteenth-century term \"manifest destiny,\" invoking the idea of American expansionism as a divine right that should extend not only to making Canada the \"fifty-first state,\" as Trump has taken to calling it, but all the way to the planet Mars.\n\nTrump's overt endorsement of a pro-Putin foreign policy has, understandably, shaken the world in the last few days. Just as jarring, in my view, has been Trump's embrace of Putin-like tactics at home, a hallmark of his return to power which has unfolded with a speed and ferocity far different than what Trump was able to pull off in his first term. Call it the Putinization of America.\n\nA quarter-century ago, as a young foreign correspondent for the Washington Post based in Moscow, I reported on Putin's takeover of Russia, a process of crushing the country's nascent, flawed democracy. Targets included any possible rival power centers that did not owe their authority to Putin, from independent media and wealthy oligarchs to elected governors. Within a few years, the Kremlin had dismantled or defanged them all. At the same time, Putin empowered former K.G.B. colleagues from the security services, who created a modern-day dictatorship for him from their stronghold in what Russians call the \"power ministries.\"\n\nThis playbook is the same one being followed now by Trump. It's important to be clear-eyed about this. I don't know where it will end, or how far Trump will take it. America, thank goodness, is still a vastly different country from Russia, with a long tradition of democratic freedoms, decentralized power in the states, and constitutional governance. But tally up the damage from one month, and it is considerable. And no, I'm not just talking about ominous theatrics like Trump openly musing about staying in office for an unconstitutional third term or, just one day ago, proclaiming himself a \"king\" on social media and having his White House circulate a fake image of him wearing a crown on the cover of a Time -like magazine.\n\nWashington today echoes with so many uncomfortable reminders of that transitional moment in Moscow-the sudden, fearful silence of critics who had previously spoken out, the business tycoons rushing to kiss the President's ring , the lying and reality distortions to fit the official narrative. Trump's consolidation of power this time has been fast and consequential. In a slew of executive orders, he has asserted the right to unilaterally revoke the Constitution's guarantee of birthright citizenship, cancel billions of dollars in federal funding, and assume executive control over independent federal agencies. He has empowered the world's richest man to fire tens of thousands of government employees and eliminate long-established, statutorily authorized programs, ranging from America's famed Epidemic Intelligence Service to its entire foreign-aid program. Although some of the cuts are being fought in the courts, the G.O.P.-controlled Congress has allowed this unprecedented usurpation of its prerogatives with hardly more than a few isolated bleats of concern. In the Senate, Republicans have rolled over on even his most controversial, unfit nominees, including, most ominously, voting on Thursday to confirm Kash Patel as director of the F.B.I., despite (or perhaps because of) the prospect that Patel will use the agency to go after Trump's enemies-a list of whom Patel helpfully itemized in a book published last year.\n\nIn some ways, Trump seems to believe he's already a dictator with unchecked power. That certainly was the message of his social-media post over the weekend, channelling his inner Napoleon with a quote often attributed to the nineteenth-century French emperor: \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.\" Just this week alone, Trump has ordered New York to stop charging cars extra for driving into Manhattan, has mused out loud about bringing the District of Columbia under federal rule, and has confirmed that he banned the Associated Press from the White House press pool for refusing to go along with his personal whim-codified in yet another executive order-to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. In a federal courtroom on Wednesday, Trump's Deputy Attorney General, Emil Bove, personally argued to drop the corruption prosecution of New York's mayor, Eric Adams , so that he could help advance Trump's anti-immigration policy agenda-a quid pro quo so obviously crooked that it led to multiple prosecutors quitting in protest. Coming soon, according to multiple news reports on Thursday, is a loyalty purge of top generals at the Pentagon, including possibly the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This time, Trump wants to insure that the power ministries are fully in his control.\n\nBack in 2019, Putin crowed in an interview with the Financial Times about the end of the \"obsolete\" liberal world order that had long since \"outlived its purpose.\" The President of the European Council at the time, Poland's Donald Tusk, pushed back on him, insisting that what was \"really obsolete\" was Putin's own heavy-handed brand of governance, with its \"authoritarianism, personality cults, and the rule of oligarchs.\" Just a few years later, reading that sentence evokes only sadness: it's no longer just Putin's Russia that threatens the foundations of Western liberal democracy but Trump's Washington. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

Steve was an energetic young professor of history at Princeton, who was studying what he called \"Stalinist civilization.\" Unlike some professors in the field, he was not a constant presence on television, unloading opinions on demand; his sources of information ranged beyond the usual, and he preferred to retain a measure of discretion for the sake of his real work. Kotkin certainly knew many dissidents and prominent Communist Party apparatchiks, editors, and security officials, but he also cultivated connections in the nascent world of Russian business and elsewhere. Early in his career, his canvas was the steel city of Magnitogorsk, in the Urals, where so much of Stalin's war machine was built. In recent years, he has been at work on a three-volume biography of Stalin ; he is working now to complete the final installment of that masterly work.\n\nKotkin is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and a scholar of prodigious research and linguistic facility. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine three years ago, we have had a series of conversations for The New Yorker Radio Hour . Our latest discussion came just a few days after Donald Trump and J. D. Vance's tag-team assault on the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, in the Oval Office. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou are hardly a fan of Donald Trump, but your tendency has been to try to look past, or around, his performances, which you've compared to professional wrestling. When it comes to Ukraine and American policy, though, what's behind the performance? What do you think Trump actually wants in Ukraine? Or is that too hard to discern?\n\nTrump is of the opinion that America has been on the wrong side of a lot of deals, not just the Ukrainian deal, and that a rebalancing is necessary. Now, Trump's style is very off-putting-some would say disgraceful. Trump behaves in ways that diminish American soft power, which is a hugely important dimension of American power. In his mind, the means don't matter as long as you get to the ends, which is a massive rebalancing of U.S. relationships across the world.\n\nLet's remember: once upon a time, the left had a view of Russia, which was that Stalin-yes, Stalin-was forging a new world, a new world of abundance and social justice and peace, that the Soviet Union was the future. The left was all in-not the entire left, but a really big part of it-on this fantasy of the Soviet Union as the future, while everybody was either starving or being murdered, as you know.\n\nNow we have a fantasy Russia on the right: that Russia is about traditional values, that Russia is defending Western civilization, that Russia is the future, that Russia is our friend. And this fantasy is complete rubbish, if we can use a technical term. We went from a fantasy on the left to a fantasy on the right about Russia. I don't share either fantasy. They're not equivalent fantasies, certainly, but they're nasty regimes in the Stalin case on a world-historical scale, and less so, but nasty, in Putin's case. I don't like these fantasies, but those fantasies are big drivers of a lot of our politics.\n\nYou're right that in the thirties, there were people on the left who were pro-Soviet, pro-Stalinist. But you also know that a huge part of the left was anti-Stalinist.\n\nO.K., that left that was pro-Stalinist was in my field until recently. They were the dominant trend in part of my field that I've been in for forty years. The right today also has people who are anti-Putin, I need to add.\n\nDo you not share the view-and it's my view-that if taken to its logical or worst extent, that the events in the White House last week could constitute a moral and strategic U-turn for the United States, which would be a disaster?\n\nPresidents rarely turn a ship as big as the United States during a four-year term. Let's remember the seventies, when Nixon was President and U.S. soft power was at a very low ebb, really in the toilet. We lost the Vietnam war. Nixon resigned over Watergate. The oil shock destroyed the Rust Belt. It was so bad that disco was popular. The seventies were really bad. And then what happened? America came back and had some of its best decades. So, it's recuperable. Now, again, I'm not validating anything here, but Trump has revealed some truths about American power and America's place in the world, and the European place in the world here, that are valuable truths. And he did it in his Trumpian fashion.\n\nWhat are those truths?\n\nSo the truths are as follows: Zelensky is looking for security guarantees, which means that not just Ukrainians will die-that people from other countries, European countries especially, will die. The Europeans have not sent a single soldier to the front during the war, and they're fighting over whether they're going to send any soldiers, even if there's a peace deal, an armistice. Poland, which is Ukraine's biggest backer, has refused to agree to promise to send peacekeepers after the fighting stops, let alone during the fighting. So Europe, God bless, is playing charades. Trump, for all his Trumpy qualities, and we all know what they are-there's no need to reiterate them, and I'm sure your magazine is full tilt in going after them-has nonetheless shown that it's put up or shut up on the European side. And even though Putin couldn't get the Europeans to get their act together, maybe Trump will.\n\nNow, would I have done it Trump's way? Do I appreciate that Trump is hurting American soft power? Yes, I get all of that, but I'm in the world that I'm in. I have the President that I have and I have the Europe that I have. And Europe just had a meeting where the principal public comment was that maybe they would get an armistice for a month, but it wouldn't be an armistice on the battlefield. And nobody would send troops. I mean, what is this charade that we're talking about? Trump exposed this. Now what are we going to do about it-first and foremost, as Europeans?\n\nNow, that's not to say that Trump is going to solve anything. It could well be that Trump's actions produce the perverse and unintended consequences that we often see in politics. It could be that the situation worsens. But the situation was not going well. The Biden policy had dead-ended long before Biden left office. Something needed to be done. The trajectory we were on was failing. And let's get on a trajectory that's succeeding.\n\nYou've written and talked extensively about the dimensions and resiliency of American power since as early as 1880. When you hear people, including me, say that the encounter between Trump and Zelensky and the White House could really take us to a horrible place, do you think that's alarmist?\n\nYes. I mean, you know American history. You know the Presidency of Andrew Jackson. You know that we had the Civil War. America has been berserk for as long as-Philip Roth: \"the indigenous American berserk.\" Now we have social media, and it's more visible than it was before. Not only is it surfaced but it's encouraged because it's the business model, right? Extremism, outrage, performance-all of this is now how you make money, not just how you show your resentment and your outrage.\n\nAmerica is a place that-few people are willing to admit-is the most powerful country ever in recorded history across all dimensions: hard power, economic power, innovation power, energy superpower, soft power, alliance power. We could go on. There's never been a power in world history on this level. The U.S. is five per cent of the global population and twenty-five per cent of global G.D.P. since 1880, more or less. That wasn't caused by government-it wasn't caused by Presidents. It can't be suppressed and strangled by Presidents, no matter what they do, and they do a lot of things that I think are detrimental to American standing in the world.\n\nAnd so the question for us is, going forward, how much of this American power is going to be used effectively, competently, as the world is changing, and how much can America rely on others? Because, let's be honest, European power has declined, Japanese power has declined. It's not American power that's declining. It's our alliances, our allies, who are declining. Our adversaries are not necessarily declining. We can argue about Russia, how deep its decline might be, but in the case of China, we clearly have a peer adversary.\n\nAnd so what's the plan? There's unlimited demand for American power. Hey, let's bring Ukraine into NATO ! Hey, let's do a security treaty with the Saudis! Everybody wants more and more American power, but American power can't fulfill all its current commitments, let alone make new ones. You remember when our strategic doctrine was to [have the ability to] fight two major wars in two major theatres simultaneously. Then Obama comes to office, and he reduces that to 1.5 major wars in major theatres. Have you ever seen half a major war? I haven't.\n\nThen Trump comes along, and he reduces it to one major war and one major theatre. So we have alliance commitments-obligations to allies-in at least three major theatres. Our strategic doctrine is we can do one at any one time. Trump is revealing, and in some cases accelerating, a process, where America's commitments exceed our capabilities, not because we're in decline but because the alliances that we're in-those countries, Germany, Japan, and a few others-are not punching at their weight. You can say that Trump is wrong in his analysis of the world. You can say that Trump's methods are abominable. But you can't say that American power is sufficient to meet its current commitments on the trajectory that we're on-and we didn't even get to the fiscal situation.\n\nHow is Vladimir Putin reading this situation? How is he watching Washington, and what does he want?\n\nRussian grand strategy for, I don't know, three centuries has been the following: West decline! Have the West implode and collapse, and then we'll survive. That's Russian grand strategy. Things are bad in Russia. They're horrible in Russia, but, hey, if the West implodes-if the West defeats itself, if the West is undermining its own policies and strengths-then Russia will be O.K. This is your fear. This is what you're talking about: that Trump is doing Putin's work for him.\n\nMy argument is that that might be true, but I wouldn't trade U.S. power for Russian power in any dimension. And I wouldn't necessarily trade our political system for their political system, because the voters punished the Democrats in the previous election, big time, and they're going to punish anybody else who's incompetent, fails to deliver, and wrecks either our institutions, our economy, inflation, the stock market. Americans hate war, and they hate losing war even more than they hate war. So Trump is playing with fire here.\n\nYou not only follow the statements and thinking of the Russian leadership but you're reading everyday sources, like Signal, in Russian. What does that tell you?\n\nThat they're hoping that this abominable war ends.\n\nWho is \"they,\" Steve-\n\nThe Russian population. So let's remember: since the fall of 2022, when the Russians were evicted from Kharkiv, it was really just riot police that were chased out of Kharkiv province. It was not some combined arms operation that the Ukrainians beat-but nonetheless it was successful and impressive. Since then, Russia has controlled nineteen per cent, roughly, of Ukrainian territory, more or less. That's more than two years. They've lost seven hundred thousand people [dead and wounded], gaining nothing in those two-plus years.\n\nNow, you ask yourself: How sustainable is that over the really long term? And the answer is, Putin keeps throwing lives into the meat grinder-now it's North Korean lives-because the Ukrainians have fewer lives to throw up against him. Ukraine doesn't need Abrams tanks. They got them and they didn't help. It doesn't need F-16 planes because they can't fight in the battlefield against Russian anti-aircraft. Ukraine needs five hundred thousand eighteen-to-twenty-four-year-olds, and nobody's sending them. But again, Russia needs the same thing. They need either to get Ukraine to capitulate, which it's refused to do, remarkably, or they need to get others to force Ukraine to capitulate, which I don't think anybody can do. So Russia's in this holding action. Putin is willing to go as long as it takes, but Russian society-maybe not.\n\nThen how does this end?\n\nWho thinks it's going to end? It started under Catherine the Great, when, in 1783, she conquered Crimea. We're in the middle of a longer-term trajectory here. People think this is going to end: Ukraine can take some territory back, and Russia's going to capitulate. They're going to win on the battlefield. The primary problem of this from the beginning has been the idea that Ukraine was going to win this on the battlefield, rather than somehow apply the kind of political pressure to force an armistice that was favorable to Ukraine, meaning they could retain the sovereignty that they defended when they defended their capital, Kyiv, and they could invest in reconstruction and attempt the kind of South Korean trajectory from the armistice in the Korean War. That's been the play from the beginning. It's still the play now. You and I have been talking about this for three years now.\n\nIn other words, the outcome that's possible, and that ends the meat grinder, is like a divided Korea: a divided Ukraine.\n\nThat's the good outcome. The bad outcome is Ukraine loses its sovereignty; it recognizes Russian annexations of the territory that Russia controls and even beyond the territory Russia currently controls; it's forced to put limits on the size of its military so it's defenseless; it cannot join an international security alliance or form any security alliance whatsoever. Those limits on Ukrainian sovereignty amount to capitulation. That's not peace; that's peace-on-the-knees, right? That's what Putin is now \"willing to negotiate.\" He was not willing to negotiate a peace in which Russia kept control over Ukrainian territories but nobody recognized them as Russian. Ukraine put no limits on its military so it could defend itself if fighting resumed, and Ukraine could join any organization that was willing to take them and that they were qualified for, whether currently existing or future existing. That's the favorable armistice that we've been hoping enough political pressure on Putin would deliver. We are nowhere near that right now. We should have been working toward that for years now, and we haven't been.\n\nWhat is the nature of the political pressure that you clearly think the Biden Administration failed to administer, and what would it be now?\n\nWe put very significant pressure on the battlefield, including allowing long-range strikes onto Russian territory, not just defense of Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory. We escalated in the economic sphere with very significant sanctions. Maybe we could do more. But nonetheless, we've done a lot there. It's in the political sphere that we've failed to apply significant pressure. Putin suffered a debacle in Syria. Who did that? The Israelis and the Turks did. So that was available the whole time, the debacle in Syria. There are many other vulnerabilities, including in Africa, where Russian interests could have been rolled back, with a little of this and a little of that.\n\nMore importantly, the story is always this: authoritarian regimes can fail at everything, and they often do, but they survive as long as they succeed at one thing: the suppression of political alternatives. If political alternatives- viable political alternatives-appear, either on the domestic scene, in the media space that's infiltrated, or in exile, the regimes can get destabilized, because a lot of people would like to see a different future for Russia. But they don't have that on the horizon, and it's too risky to step out for nothing.\n\nMy understanding of political alternatives in Russia are the following. You have on one hand, the kind of dissidents-pro-democratic dissidents-who were embodied by Alexei Navalny. We know that story. And we have to admit how limited that is. It is small in number, and the willingness of the regime to crush it knows no end. There's a different kind of dissent or alternative in Russia that's harder for Americans to see. These are not democrats-these are not Navalny-ites. They're quite different, but maybe more in number. Talk about that a little bit and what role they might play. I think it is axiomatic, and not just in Russia, that these kinds of regimes do not survive full-scale political alternatives. When they open themselves up to do so, as we saw in the late eighties, it's not a happy end.\n\nYeah, you're right. I mean, again, we've been talking about this for what, three years now?\n\nOr thirty.\n\nYes. So Navalny: unbelievably impressive. The charisma, yes, but also the organizational skills; figuring out how to win elections, where they were contestable, was phenomenal and it needed to be protected. Now, Navalny's courage and stubbornness made him go back to Russia rather than, in his mind, be irrelevant in exile. That would not have been the path that I would've taken, but he took it and he's his own man, and we have the results from that. His courage and skill: impressive for all time.\n\nBut you also have a lot of people who are part of the regime, who don't care about Ukraine, but who are hurting for Russia. They think Russia's on a failed trajectory; that the gap between Russia and the West is widening, not narrowing, over this war; that Russia has mortgaged its future; that Russia's militarized economy is not sustainable; that the banking system is basically a fiction now because they've made massive loans to the military-industrial complex that are never going to be paid back. There is almost no investment in the civilian economy. China has taken whatever market share in the Russian domestic market it's wanted. And so Russia is on a failed trajectory for Russia's own nationalist interests.\n\nAnd so [they think]: let's end the war in Ukraine and have a rapprochement with Europe. Russia has never been prosperous without a deep and multilayered relationship with Europe. Let's do that not because we love Ukraine but because we love Russia. Those people are kind of what we call internal defectors. They make up a significant part of the security and military establishment, but they're not going to go out on a limb in a situation where there's nothing on offer. There's no sanctions relief on offer to them. There's no exile-a protected exile, government in exile-offered to them. Nothing's on offer to them except support for Putin or a bullet in the neck.\n\nHow do we reach such people, and who are they?\n\nSo, the K.G.B. brought [Mikhail] Gorbachev to power. You think Gorbachev got to power himself? He was an apparatchik in Stavropol province, and [Yuri] Andropov contrived his promotion to Moscow, even though agriculture in Stavropol province had not necessarily been on the highest level. Gorbachev was inserted into the leadership because the K.G.B. was worried about the trajectory of the Soviet Union, and the widening gap in capabilities with the U.S. and others. They needed to retrench. They needed to step back. They needed to reduce their vulnerabilities, their overcommitments. They were overstretched. These are the hard men of the regime who did this. And so these people exist.\n\nNow, you're going to tell me that they're hard to find. Well, we recruit them to be information suppliers to us. The C.I.A. uses Telegram to recruit them right now. I don't know how many there are and what their names are because I don't have any security clearance.\n\nBut hey, if we can recruit them to supply the same information to the C.I.A. that I read on the Telegram and Signal channels every morning, maybe we can recruit them to form some type of pressure group, fly them to Warsaw, fly them to Helsinki, link them up with each other, figure out how to build political pressure against the Putin regime to show that there are alternatives-which are Russian nationalist, patriotic alternatives-to rescue the country from its current trajectory. Now, even if it doesn't work, it puts the pressure on the regime to come to the table, and say, I'm going to preserve the regime over continuing the self-defeating war.\n\nBut wait a minute. Some would say: Steve, let's get back to real life here. Real life is that Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and his affections are almost personal toward Vladimir Putin. When he speaks of Russia, he doesn't speak in the complexities that you've mapped out. He likes the guy, he has an affinity for the guy. He feels much closer to him than not only Volodymyr Zelensky but, conceivably, the leaders of Western European nations.\n\nTrump plays good cop with all your strongmen and faux strongmen, and he then has his staff play bad cop with them; and he plays bad cop with all of our allies, our treaty allies, and he has his staff play good cop with them.\n\nThat seems like an awfully optimistic reading of Trump's strategic wiles.\n\nAgain, Trump: this is World Wrestling Entertainment. This is television. DOGE is \"The Apprentice,\" with Musk sitting in temporarily for Trump, firing people. \"You're fired!\" This is a version of government that's news-cycle-driven, that's attention-driven, that's Trump-centric. That's the reality that you have, some of which is sincere and some of it is reversible, even in sometimes the same news cycle. You work with that-that's what you have.\n\nNow, again, Trump was elected in our system, rightly or wrongly. There isn't a mirror on the planet big enough for the Democrats and the left to look into, to see all the ways that they elected Trump. No mirror is big enough for them. But now this is what we have. And so there are people in the Trump Administration who are highly qualified on the national-security side and who understand these issues at least as well, maybe better, than I do.\n\nBut again, we have this larger problem, where there's not enough American power in the world, and hard choices have to be made-not because America's in decline but because, forty years ago, thirty years ago, the G-7 was seventy per cent of the global economy, and now it's much less. Again, that was the plan. The plan was for the rest of the world to rise up in the American-led order, and it worked. And now we're not ready for that success.\n\nYou mentioned in passing what I think is a big theme of yours, and that is whether or not the United States is in decline. It's been axiomatic from time to time, for decades now, that the United States is in decline, and that somebody else-most recently, China-is the ascendant power. I want to ask about that, and I also want to ask about how China is watching the U.S.-Ukraine-Russia drama.\n\nYes. So China's a really impressive country. It's a whole civilization. Unbelievably impressive, what they've done. Now, they went into the tank, around 1800, for a hundred and seventy years. That happens to coincide with the rise of America to superpower status. So the world before 1800 was a China-centric world. They were probably the largest economy, along with India, and they certainly viewed themselves as the center of the universe, and they had good reason to. The Europeans butt in: the British took over India; nobody ever managed to take over China, but China got roughed up by the imperialists. The U.S. rose in that world, until China started to come out of the tank in the late nineteen-seventies, but especially in the nineteen-nineties and two-thousands.\n\nNow, for the first time in recorded history, China and the U.S. are powerful at the same time. For millennia, when China was the most powerful country, the U.S. didn't exist. And when the U.S. was founded, thirteen colonies on the Eastern Seaboard-fledgling colonies of England-and three million people in the eighteenth century, China was three hundred million people and had the largest economy in the world.\n\nAnd so now you look and see that there's this U.S.-dominated world order, and China is now China again, but for the first time China in the U.S.-dominated world order. Now, China's not going to like that, and they're going to behave in such a way to push against that to shape the world order-not for U.S. interests, where China's a junior partner, but for China's interests. This is not exactly a shock, is it? It was shocking to many people that the U.S. facilitated China's rise as fast as it happened. So the irony for China is now they want to push the U.S.-led order first out of East Asia, and then we'll see-the appetite grows in the eating-but that's been the basis of their success, of coming out of the tunnel. If the Chinese lose the U.S.-led order . . . be careful what you wish for. What is their pathway forward for continued prosperity, and who supplies the global commons? Who defends the global commons on which everyone's prosperity, world trade, and security depend?\n\nSo that's the world we're in now, and they're looking at Trump and they have no idea what's coming next. Oh, my God, does he mean it? Is he sincere? Is it just bad cop with the good cop, and we can talk to the good cops? They don't know; they're off balance because of Trump. Remember, Putin thought Trump was going to deliver everything to Russia in his first term, and Trump was much harder on Russia than Obama was. So you tell me that you can predict what's going to happen, Trump vis-à-vis China, and I'll crown you king of the world.\n\nFollowing our behavior with Ukraine last week, and not only last week, what signals does that send to China? And how might China proceed with Taiwan?\n\nChina has been strangling Taiwan for years and years now: information warfare; rehearsing a massive quarantine or blockade of Taiwan, even as we speak; cutting the cables around Taiwan to-there are only fourteen cables that connect Taiwan to the global network, and they can be cut, and then you're left with Musk and Starlink, aren't you? So this is under way already. It was under way during Obama's Administration when they built the military bases on the coral reefs in the South China Sea, and Obama shrugged. And it was under way during Trump's first term, and it was under way under Biden, and it's under way again. And so it's not as if it's just started or it's not as if there's been a revelation recently.\n\nChina's decision-making is in one man. It's one person making a hundred-trillion-dollar decision. That's what we're talking about. That's impossible to predict. It's very hard to deter if you don't know the inside of the Chinese system. It's as opaque as any system has ever been. [Xi Jinping] is an opaque leader who doesn't reveal himself, doesn't do small talk. We don't really have an answer for it. And by the way, when we asked our European allies: if there were a conflict in the Indo-Pacific involving the U.S. and China, would they come to our aid? Their answer was maybe, maybe not. That was under Biden, Mr. Transatlanticist. And so the Europeans are not all in with us over Taiwan or the Indo-Pacific, but, hey, we have to be all in with the Europeans over Ukraine or over other vulnerable areas. And so we're in this situation again where war is catastrophic, and Xi Jinping is making the decision, and I have no idea his thought processes, and I don't think anybody else does have an idea, even inside the Chinese system.\n\nI don't quite understand why Xi Jinping, in the current circumstances, would not make a move on Taiwan. It's not entirely clear that the United States would rush to defend Lithuania or Estonia or Poland, NATO countries. Why would it intervene with Taiwan, which is so many thousands of miles more away?\n\nBecause Xi Jinping knows more about the People's Liberation Army than you do. The P.L.A. is corrupt top to bottom, inside out, left to right, right to left. Is it a reliable instrument? When you roll \"the iron dice,\" as Bismarck called them, and you launch a war, you'd better be sure that you can win, because otherwise, your regime might fall. He'd be rolling the iron dice with the fate of the Communist regime in China. Everybody says he wants to go into the history books as the man who unified China, took back Hong Kong and took back Taiwan, mastered the South China Sea. But how about going into the history books as the guy who rolled the iron dice and lost the Chinese Communist regime the way Gorbachev peacefully lost the Soviet Union and the Communist regime?\n\nSo you're talking about the ultimate risk. It's existential. And his info on the P.L.A. is pretty substantial. He's the chairman of the military commission in addition to being the President and the General Secretary of the Party. And I've got to tell you, a lot of people have been getting fired for corruption, including people he recently appointed. And so how certain is he of success? Which is why many analysts-and I sign on to their analysis-are more worried about quarantine than they are worried about amphibious attack across the strait. The Taiwan Strait theatre is the same size as the Mediterranean. Let's remember that Hitler couldn't cross the Channel.\n\nSo this is the hardest military operation to do, with a military that he might not be fully confident in, with risks that include the loss of his regime. So the more we can focus on their vulnerabilities and talk about the existential risk to that regime, the more we can enhance deterrence. Deterrence is not just Tomahawk missiles in Japan. It's the political dimension: the regime has to be afraid for its existence, and then maybe it won't do the kinds of things that put its existence at risk.\n\nA final question. As a historian, you look at the United States through the lens of institutions, its past, its resilience, and not through the lens of the World Wide Wrestling Federation. Fair enough. But in the real world, that we're living in, you have a government leadership that is now led by not only Donald Trump, who has his own character, but Kash Patel, Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, and on and on. Does your confidence in the stability and the resilience of the system survive that kind of leadership?\n\nWell, we'll live to see the answer to that. That's an empirical question. You're asking me to speculate on the future, but I believe we'll live to see that.\n\nWe'll live to see its endurance?\n\nWe'll live to see the answer to your question.\n\nAh, not so optimistic. I see.\n\nMy view is pretty clear. The society is unbelievably strong, resilient, and dynamic. It's incredible what you can get with American society-that's not going away. Yes, there are issues like opioid overdose, fentanyl. There's many, many issues that we can talk about. You know them all. You talk about them with your other guests. And those are all worrisome, and some of them are deeply worrisome. Nonetheless, over all, American society is really impressive. American institutions are phenomenal, and they've lasted a really long time. Of course, there are a lot of shortcomings. There are a lot of times we don't live up to our promises. There are a lot of times that there's violence in the streets, and much worse, in the past.\n\nBut my point being: we've been through a lot before. We need to remember that. That's not necessarily an excuse for incompetence, violation of the law, or anything else. But we have this inbuilt radicalism now, where you win an election by ten thousand votes in some state called a swing state. You get a fifty-fifty Senate or close to it, and you decide to reinvent the American system, whether you're going to do a Green New Deal, or whatever. And then the other side wins, also by the skin of its teeth, and it comes in and it decides it's going to reinvent America again, because otherwise we'll \"lose our country.\" Then a couple of years pass, and the American people punish the hell out of them-for their failures, for their incompetence, and just for their ideological excesses.\n\nWe have the berserk-that's just inherent in who we are as a nation and a people-but we also have a middle ground where common sense prevails, where coalitions are necessary, where legislation passes not with fifty-one votes but with seventy votes, or not with two hundred and nineteen votes but with three hundred or four hundred votes. That's happened in the past; therefore, it's possible to get there. Again, it's not going to be easy and simple, because the media environment has been radicalized. We went through this when radio was invented: people thought it was the end of civilization because they could just broadcast anything into people's living rooms and nobody could stop them. But we mastered radio as an open society; we got Roosevelt. The same thing happened with TV, which was even worse because it was not just voice but images. And it was the end of civilization because you could show anybody and you could deceive and it wasn't the truth and nobody could stop them. And we got Kennedy, and then Reagan.\n\nNow we have social media, which is much more radical and disruptive, because everybody is a publisher now. Everybody has a megaphone now. It's been massively destabilizing, and we're worried that the authoritarians are gaining the upper hand, just like it happened with Mussolini and Goebbels in radio; just like it happened with television. And it turned out that we mastered and assimilated those as a free society, and now we have to do the same with social media. It first produced Obama, and then it produced Trump. So that's the reality we're in now.\n\nHow do we keep a free society while assimilating this massively disruptive technology? I don't know the answer to that, but I believe that in the short run, we're all dead. China attacks, Russia attacks, Iran gets the bomb. But, in the long run, we're good. Because we have the better system, we have corrective mechanisms, we have a free and open society, we've got a judiciary that still works, and we can do this because we've done it before. And we've come from the depths. The Civil War! Andrew Jackson! There's a lot in American history that is not necessarily optimistic for the future, and yet we made it through to the other side, and it's quite possible we'll make it through the current epoch that we're in. And certainly I wouldn't bet on the authoritarians in the long run, even if the short run can be very messy and maybe worse than messy. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Why \"Constitutional Crisis\" Fails to Capture Trump's Attack on the Rule of Law\n\nSince Donald Trump took office, on January 20th, his Administration has slow-walked or outright failed to comply with court orders related to a range of issues, most notably immigration and government funding. I recently spoke by phone with Samuel R. Bagenstos, a professor of law at the University of Michigan and a former general counsel to the Department of Health and Human Services in the Biden Administration. The goal was to go through some of these cases to understand why legal experts are so concerned, and whether there is a larger strategy to the Administration's behavior. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we also discussed the problem with the phrase \"constitutional crisis,\" whether bureaucratic incompetence could really be the reason for some of Trump's actions, and why the past two months have been so unprecedented in American history.\n\nAre we living through a constitutional crisis, or do you feel like we're still some distance away from one?\n\nI really hate the significance that's being put on the phrase \"constitutional crisis.\" We are living through a massive assault on basic premises of our constitutional system. It's been brewing for a long time, but it's been acute for the last two months. Call that a crisis or not, but either way we are in deep, deep trouble.\n\nWhy don't you like the phrase?\n\nIt has so many potential meanings. A constitutional crisis could be something that is a very discrete event, where two branches of government stare each other in the face in what looks like a standoff, and then they eventually resolve it. Or a constitutional crisis could be, Wow, it looks like basic building blocks of our constitutional system are about to go away. I think we're much more in that second mode here. The phrase suggests that once you cross a certain point, something bad is going to happen that didn't happen before. And so everybody starts asking, Well, have we crossed it yet? If the President is winking at court orders but not really defying them, is that enough? If the President is defying district-court orders but not the Supreme Court, is that enough? And I think that's sort of a fool's game. I'd rather just focus on what the President is doing.\n\nWhy does this seem to you more about the basic building blocks of our constitutional system going away, as opposed to two branches-in this case the judiciary and the executive-facing off?\n\nI think it's more than just the President facing off against the judiciary. We have to look at what all these disputes are about. How did these cases get into court in the first place? We have a President who has made very clear that he believes he has the prerogative to pick and choose what laws passed by Congress he has to follow. And so to me that's the first and most fundamental challenge to our constitutional order here. All of these cases are about laws Congress has passed. Congress passed laws appropriating money for particular purposes. Congress passed laws creating certain agencies. Congress passed laws creating processes for dealing with immigration. And the President just doesn't want to follow them. That's why he's been brought to court.\n\nThe President and his people have been very overt about their belief that they don't have to follow the laws Congress has passed. Now we're getting to a point where Trump and Musk and the people in this Administration are suggesting that they might not be bound by the courts holding them to those laws. I think that compounds the problem-I don't think that is the problem itself. I think that's a symptom that makes it worse.\n\nThe case that's received the most attention is about a group of Venezuelan men who were flown to El Salvador last week, in violation of a judge's order. It appears that one of the three planes had not left when the judge ordered that the government not deport these men, at least temporarily. Have you heard anything specific from the Administration in their defense of their behavior that makes you think this was something other than defiance of a court order?\n\nNo, I have not.\n\nThey have said that they weren't told in time. They've said that some of the planes were over international waters. They have said that the judge's order that the planes be turned around was verbal, not written.\n\nWhen you look at the submissions that the Department of Justice has made in defense of what happened here, you see two things. You see a series of arguments that this really wasn't a violation of the order. And I think that's important-that the Trump Administration has consistently acted at least under the pretense that they are trying to comply with all of these court orders. But then it's surrounded by a whole bunch of language and rhetoric that strongly suggests that they don't believe the courts have power to act in these cases.\n\nThey're basically saying, Look, we have a bunch of arguments, however implausible, that we were complying, but, anyway, you don't want to push this, judge, because we don't really think you have the power here. It's a way of trying to get some leverage in what really feels like a negotiation with the court. That's one way to think about these arguments: they're not necessarily being offered in the sense that this court or any other court would really believe them, so much as this gives them a way to say they're complying while also telling the court that you better not push us.\n\nNow what are the arguments they've made? The argument that the planes were in international waters-well, the planes have radios. Obviously, if the President or the people who the pilots answer to told them to turn the planes around, they would have turned the planes around. The people making that decision were within the United States, and within the jurisdiction of the court. The idea that the planes were outside of U.S. airspace, and therefore they couldn't do anything about it, that's just laughable on its face.\n\nIt also appears that these planes may have taken off during the hearing. And certainly when I was working in the government-and I worked in three Presidential Administrations, during which I worked in or very closely with the Department of Justice-we would never have come close to trying to moot a pending hearing before a judge, to take a judge's jurisdiction away by trying to get planes in the air before the hearing started or certainly before it ended. Secondly, the fact that they're making the argument shows a lack of respect for the judicial system and a lack of willingness to submit to judicial review of their actions.\n\nAs for the oral order and not the written order of the court, well, this was an emergency situation. It was a hearing that was called precisely because there was a real worry that the Administration would try to deprive the court of jurisdiction. And so what the judge said very clearly in the hearing was that you have to make sure those planes turn around if there are any planes in the air. That was clearly communicated to the Department of Justice, which represents the Administration here. The minute written order was just a summary of what had happened orally. That's what so-called minute orders are. That's the difference between a minute order and a fully fleshed out order that stands on its own. The fact that not every word the judge said in the hearing was reflected in the minute order doesn't mean he was somehow implicitly taking back what he said.\n\nI had asked another lawyer about this question of moving ahead with your plans before a court date, and he said that, until there's a temporary restraining order telling you that you can't do it, it's relatively normal for governments to keep doing what they are doing. Is that not your understanding, though?\n\nI think we might be having a conversation about the timing here. It's one thing if you're the government and you're doing something controversial that might trigger a lawsuit or that maybe has triggered a lawsuit, but there's no impending hearing for a temporary restraining order. Well, until there's an order issued against you, you are legally free to continue to engage in the behavior that's been challenged. And, to the extent that's what your friend is saying, that makes total sense. When a hearing has been scheduled on an emergency basis and it is hours, if not minutes away, taking an action to deprive the court of its ability to decide the motion that is before it at the emergency hearing is not something that is at all normal. And that seems to be, at best, what they did here. So I don't think the story is a good one for the Administration, and I don't think it shows the kind of respect for the courts that the Department of Justice and the executive branch usually show.\n\nAnother case concerns a Lebanese doctor, Rasha Alawieh, who was deported last week. She had a U.S. visa, and there's some question about whether her deportation was done in defiance of a judge's order. The government is saying that by the time the order from the judge came through she had been deported.\n\nI think I need to understand the facts of that one better. Certainly, the judge in that case has suggested that there may be a violation of his order. I think one of the complicating factors is that immigration law is complicated, and, you know, she had left the country and was trying to reënter. I'm not sure I have a good answer factually on what happened there, but it's certainly very troubling in light of the court's order and is part of the general pattern, but I wouldn't want to litigate it yet.\n\nDuring the first Trump Administration, there often was a lot of incompetence. This term seems like it will be perhaps less incompetent and even more malicious, but I am curious about the degree to which something like lawyers for the Department of Justice communicating with agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement can take a while, as the government claims it did here, because of bureaucratic incompetence.\n\nThere are glitches in communication sometimes. I will tell you though that in my experience as the general counsel of a Cabinet agency in the previous Administration, where we were often in litigation that challenged our own actions and that was proceeding on an emergency basis, we were in very close touch with the Department of Justice attorneys and were very careful not to take action that would violate an order of the court or that would even come close to violating an order of the court, and we wanted to make sure that we would act in a way that was consistent with what the court said. I find it inconceivable that this sort of thing would have happened in our Administration, at least in the part of our Administration that I worked in, because we were in such close touch.\n\nIn an earlier case, from January, a Rhode Island judge said, basically, that the Administration had ignored his order to unfreeze federal funds that the Administration had tried to stop from being disbursed. What is the status of that case?\n\nThere was the initial funding-freeze memo that was issued by the Office of Management and Budget that was the target of the lawsuit. And O.M.B. very quickly purported to withdraw it. But then on the same day that they withdrew the memo the President's press secretary said, We haven't withdrawn the freeze. So the judge issued a temporary restraining order, saying, Well, you haven't actually withdrawn the freeze, and you have to. You're violating Congress's power of the purse by freezing appropriated funds. Then there was a great deal of evidence presented by states and grantees that although the government had been ordered to unfreeze funds, it was not doing so. And so the judge said that the government was violating his order. He said, I'm not going to hold you in contempt, but I am going to issue an order enforcing my order. And there was still very significant evidence that the government was refusing to spend the funds that had previously been frozen. And then, in issuing a preliminary injunction, the judge again said, You violated my order. That is now on appeal.\n\nI can tell you that some funds have been unfrozen since the initial order and the preliminary injunction. But I talk to grantees, and there are a number who still tell me they have not gotten the money that should be going to them. What you're seeing in these cases is at best slow-walking compliance with court orders and probably some continued resistance to compliance.\n\nWe have something similar in a case involving U.S.A.I.D. grants. The government initially froze all these grants and contracts. A court issued an order saying you can't do that. You have to unfreeze the grants. And then U.S.A.I.D. and the State Department said, O.K., well, what we're going to do is we're going to go through the grants one by one and decide, not based on the blanket freeze but one by one, whether it's appropriate to continue each grant. They somehow managed to get through close to ten thousand grants and contracts that they say they individually reviewed up to the level of the Secretary of State in about six weeks. They decided to cancel more than eighty per cent of them. And then the court said, Well, I'm still enjoining you from a blanket freeze, but I don't have the authority to enjoin you from individual decisions. The individual grantees might have to sue about that. This may reward the Administration's conduct.\n\nWhen you say \"reward the Administration's conduct,\" do you think that the judge had a choice or that just the way our system is set up, there's no way to do anything about it?\n\nWe're in a situation where we have something that is beyond unprecedented in the executive branch in terms of its assault on basic premises of our constitutional system, and particularly of congressional supremacy in the area of spending money. And so that is a very difficult matter for courts to deal with. They don't have a lot of experience dealing with it. Following ordinary procedural rules, as the judges are doing, may well be the right choice in the sense that it's following legal practice. But it also is in some ways insufficient to provide a remedy to stop or unwind or rectify this assault on basic premises of our system.\n\nI think I totally understand where the judgment's coming from. If it's one thing to say a blanket refusal to spend money is a violation of Congress's power of the purse, it's something else once the Administration says, We're making decisions based on individual grants and based on relevant legal factors related to individual grants. Now, I think it's implausible that they did any serious analysis of each individual grant when we're talking about thousands of grants over the course of a six-week period, that purportedly each one individually was briefed up to the Secretary of State. But I can understand why in ordinary legal practice a judge doesn't second-guess when a high-ranking official of the executive branch says, I engaged in this individualized analysis. So I think they're bringing ordinary processes to a very extraordinary situation.\n\nIt does seem that this is an Administration intent on acting as if it is not bound by the law, and that the specific details of each case are worth looking into and, of course, litigating, but that doing so may miss the bigger picture. Or is that not right?\n\nI think that's a fair description. This is definitely a case where you're going to have a better understanding of what's going on if you're looking at the over-all picture. We can have arguments about these individual cases. But although litigation has been very important in stopping the most egregious abuses, in bringing facts to light about what's been going on, litigation is not going to ultimately be the solution here. The way litigation works is it adjudicates discrete controversies between particular parties. It's not set up to adjudicate the basic premises of our constitutional system being attacked in a significant way. Here we have a broad assault that is made up of many discrete decisions put together. It's really an assault on the prerogatives of Congress, which is the people's branch.\n\nWell, they don't give a shit.\n\nRight. That's where I was going to go. One of the very depressing and dispiriting aspects of this is that Congress is not standing up for its prerogatives. Probably the greatest opinion in the history of constitutional law is Justice Robert Jackson's opinion in the steel-seizure case. One of the things he says is that President Truman violated the Constitution in trying to seize steel mills, purportedly for war-production purposes. To me, the most important part of the opinion is when he says, Look, the courts can't countenance this kind of violation of congressional prerogative. Because the seizure of the steel mills would both regulate commerce and constitute a taking of property that would require compensation, only Congress could authorize it. And I think what we're seeing right now is a legislative branch that is not standing up for its prerogatives. People expect too much if they expect the courts to try to aggressively defend legislative prerogatives when Congress won't do that. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "What to Make Of Paul Weiss' Capitulation to Donald Trump\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nMany Americans may not have taken notice, but yesterday marked yet another turning point for this Trump administration: A major U.S. law firm waved the white flag to our authoritarian president.\n\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, based in New York, has a lengthy list of powerful clients and a long-standing commitment to causes of public interest. On March 14, it was singled out by Trump when he issued an executive order accusing the law firm of \"undermining the judicial process\" and participating \"in the destruction of bedrock American principles.\"\n\nHe did so because the firm's definition of the public interest leaned in a liberal direction, and because it employs Mark Pomerantz, who worked with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg in the New York hush money trial, for which the president was convicted of committing 34 felonies.\n\nThe president channeled his grievances against Paul Weiss and other so-called global law firms by alleging that they \"have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections.\" The order also claims: \"They have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono, or ostensibly 'for the public good'-potentially depriving those who cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to justice deserved by all.\"\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the order also singled out Pomerantz, calling him \"unethical\" and pointing out, in unusually personal terms, that he \"left Paul Weiss to join the Manhattan District Attorney's office solely to manufacture a prosecution against me.\"\n\nAmong other things, the president directed his subordinates \"to suspend any active security clearances held by individuals at Paul Weiss and Mark Pomerantz\" and \"take appropriate steps to terminate any contract ... for which Paul Weiss has been hired to perform any service.\"\n\nThe choice the firm faced reminded me of a classic 1950s television commercial. It shows a woman slowly turning to the camera, revealing a black eye and professing her loyalty to her brand of cigarettes by saying, \"Us Tareyton smokers would rather fight than switch.\"\n\nIn Paul Weiss' case, though, it took just six days for it to switch rather than fight, abandoning its principles and those of the legal profession. This is a surprising development, given the firm's history.\n\nAs the New York Times explains , \"The firm has long prided itself on breaking barriers and standing up to the government on issues like civil rights. Its website trumpets how it was the first major New York City firm to have Jewish lawyers working alongside Gentiles, to hire a Black associate and to have a female partner.\" Moreover, the legal profession has long been considered an advocate of what former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once called \"the attainment of liberty through law.\"\n\nApparently, Paul Weiss did not get that message. What the firm did yesterday is a reminder of the Vietnam-era adage that justified American wartime abuses: \"We have to burn this village to save it.\"\n\nBrad Karp, the head of the firm, went, hat in hand, to the Oval Office and lit a match to the firm's reputation. To get the president to back off his threats to the firm, Karp agreed \"to a series of commitments, including to represent clients no matter their political affiliation and contribute $40 million in legal services to causes Mr. Trump has championed, including 'the President's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, and other mutually agreed projects.' \"\n\nWould any self-respecting lawyer and law firm let anyone, including the president of the United States, tell them whom they should represent or give into the kind of blackmail that has become a regular practice since Trump returned to office? I would have assumed that Karp and Paul Weiss would have rejected such overtures.\n\nThere is some dispute over the exact terms of the agreement; HuffPost reported discrepancies between the version of the document the White House posted and what Karp sent to his firm. For example, the White House version asserts that the firm had agreed Pomerantz was indeed guilty of \"wrongdoing,\" though the particular kind of wrongdoing was left unspecified. The only wrong that Pomerantz did was to do his job in a way that offended the president, and Karp's note failed to mention him.\n\nBut the damage has already been done. That is why, even as it described the differences in the versions of events offered by Karp and the White House, HuffPost still referred to what it called a \"shocking agreement\" between them.\n\nIn light of that agreement, one can only imagine the hallway conversations between lawyers at Paul Weiss right now. The firm's capitulation is a blow to the forces seeking to resist the destruction of America's constitutional order. When the history of this era is written, the proverb that fish \"rot from the head\" may have particular purchase in explaining the significance of Paul Weiss' actions. The firm's surrender also signifies another kind of rot, namely what Yale Law professor Jack Balkin calls \"constitutional rot,\" which he defines as \"a degradation of constitutional norms that may operate over a long period of time.\"\n\nWhen constitutional rot becomes advanced, Balkin notes, \"people turn to demagogues, ... who stoke division, anger and resentment. Demagogues promise that they will restore lost glories and make everything right again.\" These demagogues proceed by cowing their opponents and encouraging everyone, especially the most powerful loci of resistance, to fall in line. And falling in line is exactly what Paul Weiss did.\n\nGoing after large law firms is the Trump administration's way of showing that no one is safe. Making one of them say uncle and going public about it demonstrates that proposition.\n\nStanding up to bullies is the best way to deal with the administration. By backing down, Paul Weiss feeds the beast and encourages more of the kind of bullying that the White House has used against it.\n\nThe first domino has fallen. Sadly, others will soon follow.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

Many of my relatives-including my mother-lived in poverty for their entire lives. They could only focus on day-to-day survival and worrying about how they would get their next meal. For us, this meant that retirement planning was never something we discussed. In fact, I don't ever recall hearing the word retirement mentioned at all. The idea of having a nest egg or a financial safety net felt like a totally foreign concept.\n\nFew of us have a pension plan, let alone a 401(k). I'm one of the lucky ones. Though it's never been much, I've been able to contribute a small amount from each paycheck to my retirement funds. Now, because of recent economic developments in the United States, coupled with the potential threat to Social Security , I'm starting to worry that I might never be able to retire at all.\n\nSince Donald Trump returned to office, his actions (and threatened actions)-specifically regarding tariffs-have made investors nervous, which has led to market instability and trillions of dollars in losses in the S&P 500 . Some economists have warned that there's a good chance the U.S. may be heading toward a recession . Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both recently said they couldn't rule out that possibility . Because of the way retirement plans are connected to the stock market, many people have experienced-or are waiting to see-a precipitous drop in the funds they thought they had. This disproportionately affects people in lower income brackets-people like me whose accounts don't have much in them to begin with.\n\nMy employer's retirement plan has a hybrid structure-half of it is a pension, and the other half is an investment plan similar to a 401(k). The pension part is less volatile and has lower risk, so I'm not nervous about that. The investment half, on the other hand, is a totally different story. Like many other people in this country with investment-based retirement accounts, I've been experiencing an increasing sense of dread as I track the daily stock market updates and realize the value of my retirement account is plummeting. As the balance gets smaller, the pit in my stomach seems to grow bigger.\n\nI've been contributing to this retirement fund for nearly 15 years now. Financially speaking, I'd consider myself to be lower middle class, so while my monthly contributions may not seem like a huge amount, it's a lot of money to me, as someone who lives on a tight budget. Diverting that portion of my paycheck into this retirement account has meant I've had to forgo nonessential \"splurges\" and cut other expenses. I'm crushed to see such a shocking drop in that precious fund, which represents years of sacrifice and hard work. It's also disheartening to think about the devastating financial harm Trump has caused for so many families within the span of just a few weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, another saga currently unfolding in the country is compounding my anxiety about how I will survive in my later years. Trump and Elon Musk ( the latter of whom seems to be driving many recent national actions and decisions ) appear to have Social Security in their crosshairs, with Musk referring to the critical program as a \"Ponzi scheme.\" It's unlikely that Musk, currently the richest man in the world , has any idea about what Social Security means to the millions of people who rely on it to survive.\n\nThis makes me very nervous about the future of Social Security. Many other Americans feel the same way . Voters have swarmed town hall events held by GOP lawmakers to express concern and anger about recent changes and potential cuts to the program. \"I paid into that my entire career,\" a voter from North Carolina said at a town hall meeting, according to an Associated Press story. \"I worked from the time I was 16. I paid into that, it's mine and I want it.\"\n\nSome of my family members aren't even eligible to collect Social Security because they haven't paid enough into the system. Their only option for income in their senior years is Supplemental Security Income and any benefits that might be available through their state. SSI currently has a minimum benefit payment that is less than $1,000 a month-and that's assuming there are no cuts or changes to the SSI system. For most people, that's nowhere near enough to survive on, which is why some seniors are forced to choose between food and utilities or health care and medications . I've heard some of my relatives talk about receiving utility shutoff notices or skipping doses of their medication because their grocery bills are taking up so much of their monthly budget. Musk, who some say appears to be on a crusade against seniors due to a combination of \"ego and spite, \" is unlikely to care.\n\nSocial Security officials have already announced staff reductions and office closures . Other plans reportedly in the works include changes that would make it more difficult for people to file claims or get assistance. A former Social Security commissioner has warned that these and other changes recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency could lead to a \"system collapse\" and interruption of benefits. Some experts and lawmakers including Sen. Bernie Sanders have predicted that Trump's goal is to privatize Social Security, a scenario that seems plausible to me, as well.\n\nWith this double whammy putting financial support that I'd hoped could help fund my eventual retirement on shaky ground, I now find myself among the nearly half of Gen Xers who feel like they will need a miracle to be able to retire .\n\nMy retirement fund balance is very modest by most standards. Some might call it minimal. It's nowhere near enough to cover my current monthly bills. I have no delusions about living my senior years in luxury or with enough disposable income to travel the world. I know that I'll need to tighten my belt and cut down on any nonessential spending. Still, I had hoped my relatively meager nest egg would be enough to cover my bare necessities and core living expenses. Now, even that simple goal seems like it might be too ambitious.\n\nIn my most optimistic dreams, I had hoped to be able to retire at around age 65, but I accepted the more realistic possibility that I would have to try to keep working until 70 to maximize my retirement benefits. (That's assuming, of course, that I don't experience any major health events that derail my plans and take the choices out of my hands.) With even that age-70 timeline now seeming too ambitious, I'm anxious that I might have no choice but to continue working even once my physical or mental health makes that difficult. I'm also sad that after a lifetime of hard work, I might never be able to slow down and relax or spend quality time with my future grandchildren.\n\nI strongly hope that I am wrong, and that things change course soon and turn the financial circumstances in a more positive direction. Right now, though, things feel very unstable and worrisome, so it's wise to try to prepare for challenging times as best as we can. In my case, that means shifting my mindset and not taking retirement as a given. I'm now focusing on cutting expenses, paying down debt, and exploring side hustles and additional sources of extra income. Instead of planning for travel and leisure activities in my postretirement years, I might have to accept the painful reality that, despite my efforts to make things different, retirement might be-as it has been for many of my loved ones-a luxury that I won't be able to afford.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Is the Trump Administration Going Out of Its Way to Piss Off John Roberts?\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOver the past five days, the Trump administration has put on a master class in how to piss off Chief Justice John Roberts. Its behavior in the Alien Enemies Act case seems designed to rankle the chief in every conceivable way: Rather than win the case on the merits, the administration has launched a multilevel assault on the presiding judge, James Boasberg. It isn't just that Donald Trump, along with his co-President Elon Musk, has called for Boasberg's impeachment -though that escalation did prompt Roberts to issue a rare rejoinder . It's that the Justice Department, too, has gotten in on the action, insulting Boasberg in insolent filings that openly question his integrity, neutrality, and competence. In short, the administration is deliberately staking this out as a battle between the executive branch and the judicial branch.\n\nThere is surely some considered tactic at play here. The tactic simply appears not to be \"Winning John Roberts' vote.\" Rather, the Trump administration seems eager to prevail in the court of public opinion, then leverage that victory to make the courts fall in line-the same play it's running on Congress. The public-facing side of this strategy is obvious enough. First, the administration raced to deport Venezuelan migrants whom it accused, without evidence, of membership in the Tren de Aragua gang. Then it invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to argue that courts had no authority to stop the operation. When Boasberg ordered a halt to it nonetheless, high-ranking Trump officials bashed him in the media , while Trump and Musk called for his impeachment . House Republicans have now introduced articles of impeachment against the judge, and Musk is encouraging the effort by donating money to lawmakers who support it.\n\nIn court, the administration's tone is only somewhat less contemptuous. The DOJ evidently defied Boasberg on Saturday, when he ordered the return of planes carrying migrants to El Salvador; rather than comply with his directive, the government let two planes continue to their destination and allowed a third to take off well after the order. When Boasberg called a hearing to probe this disobedience, the Justice Department responded with a blast of impudent fury. First, government lawyers told him he had no power to issue the order in the first place, implicitly justifying the administration's defiance. Second, they told him his order didn't count anyway because it had been delivered from the bench (a claim that is absurd ). Third, they tried (and failed) to postpone the hearing, warning that they would refuse to provide him with key information if summoned to court. Fourth, they asked a higher court to take away the case from Boasberg, accusing him of engaging in \"highly unusual and improper procedures.\" (A request for reassignment is typically considered the nuclear option in federal court, a last resort only after a judge has engaged in indefensible, intransigent misbehavior.)\n\nBoasberg held the hearing anyway-and, as it had promised, the DOJ declined to answer questions about its own alleged defiance of his order. The judge then ordered the government lawyers to answer his questions while allowing them to do so under seal to avoid the public disclosure of sensitive information. The DOJ, though, was not placated: Instead, it filed a shockingly nasty protest filled with angry jabs at Boasberg. It dismissed the kerfuffle as \"a picayune dispute over the micromanagement of immaterial factfinding\" and accused Boasberg of lacking sufficient \"respect\" for the Trump administration.\n\n\"The court,\" the lawyers wrote, \"has now spent more time trying to ferret out information about the government's flight schedules and relations with foreign countries than it did in investigating the facts\" before ruling for the migrants. (In reality, this information is largely public already, because the White House shared many details of the operation while boasting about the deportation flights.) Boasberg, they continued, was seeking \"to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the government legally immaterial facts,\" including \"state secrets.\" (The relevant facts are not \"legally immaterial\"-they could show whether the government broke the law!) The filing called on Boasberg to end his \"unnecessary judicial fishing expeditions\" and asked him to freeze proceedings while they begged an appeals court to bail them out.\n\nAs a rule, attorneys do not communicate with judges like this. Attorneys representing the United States certainly do not write this way. Boasberg could have raised the prospect of sanctions immediately. Instead, in a tempered response , he reminded the Justice Department that it had never before even raised the possibility that divulging the facts around this case would reveal \"state secrets.\" And he pointed out that the DOJ had not even previously noted that the relevant information was classified. In an act of grace, he nonetheless gave the government's lawyers a 24-hour extension and reminded them that they have to actually invoke the state-secrets privilege if they want to rely upon it. The lawyers, however, wound up regurgitating details they had already provided, a response Boasberg dismissed as \"woefully insufficient.\"\n\nThe DOJ's crude treatment of Boasberg sends the unmistakable message that he is a rogue judge who needs to be reined in by a tough president and, ideally, a congressional impeachment. Attorney General Pam Bondi made her agency's position clear on Wednesday, when she accused the judge of \"meddling in our government.\" Why, she asked, is Boasberg \"trying to protect terrorists who invaded our country over American citizens?\" (Again, there is no evidence these people are terrorists.) The thrust of her comments, echoed in DOJ filings, is that Boasberg is so biased and reckless that he cannot be trusted to oversee a case with such sensitive implications for national security.\n\nOne person who would disagree with such claims about Boasberg is John Roberts. The chief justice himself appointed Boasberg to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court as presiding judge; in that position, he regularly reviewed, and ruled upon, extraordinarily sensitive requests by intelligence agencies to surveil communications between suspected spies and foreign powers. The surveillance court's work is shrouded in secrecy, and even the smallest public disclosure could jeopardize vital intelligence operations. And Roberts appointed Boasberg to lead it. He also appointed Boasberg as chief judge of the U.S. Alien Terrorist Removal Court, where he would hear similarly sensitive information to determine if terrorists should be deported. (The court has never conducted proceedings.) It's notable, too, that George W. Bush appointed both Roberts and Boasberg to the bench. (Barack Obama later elevated Boasberg to his current position.)\n\nObviously, Roberts has deep trust and respect for Boasberg. Why else would he handpick the judge to serve on these specialized courts? (Boasberg also has a connection to Justice Brett Kavanaugh: The two were roommates at Yale Law School.) Several of Boasberg's clerks have also gone on to clerk for Roberts, yet another indication that the chief justice respects his judgment.\n\nIt's true that Roberts' statement in Boasberg's defense was not exactly impassioned. (In fact, it was just two sentences: \"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" he wrote. \"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\") But the substance matters less than the mere existence of an intervention by the chief, who rarely speaks out publicly about any topic. He makes the very occasional exception to defend judges under fire, as he did during Trump's first term. And the fact that he stepped into the fray to defend Boasberg is proof in itself that the administration has made a misstep. Moreover, a defining feature of Roberts' jurisprudence is his intolerance for bad lawyering. His past votes against Trump reflect an aversion to sloppy and dishonest legal arguments, and he does not take kindly to insulting, patronizing, or underhanded reasoning. Yet that is exactly how the Justice Department has approached Boasberg in this case.\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, two possible explanations for this strange conduct. The first is that the administration does not care about alienating Roberts and believes that it can coerce him into compliance with its agenda through public pressure. The second is more alarming: that if Roberts does start siding against Trump-if the Supreme Court blocks his agenda-it plans to also ignore those rulings and is laying the groundwork for that defiance now. The ongoing refusal to comply with Boasberg's order may well be a blueprint for future disobedience on a bigger scale. If that is what lies ahead, then the chief justice was wise to step in early. But he will need to do a great deal more than issue a bone-dry statement to the press.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Hello Again, Donald Trump\n\nThis is part of Hello, Trumpworld , Slate's reluctant guide to the people who will be calling the shots now-at least for as long as they last in Washington.\n\nRemember four years ago ? We were all listening to \"Drivers License.\" Nomadland fever was sweeping the nation. Everyone was about to get vaccinated. (Remember how we'd call it \"the jab\"-\"Did you get the jab yet?\") And Donald Trump was on his way out of the White House. He was a footnote, a one-term president, a hiccup in the arc of history-the guy people would remember, 50 years from now, with a collective chuckle and shake of the head. That sure was the last gasp of the 20 th century , the future would say. They elected that fucking TV clown president!\n\nWell, we were all wrong. (Maybe you weren't wrong. Maybe you always knew he'd win again! I'll stop using the royal we .) I was certainly wrong. I absolutely thought that cocky piece of shit was washed up: that the chickens were coming home to roost, and that his was a future of courtrooms, exorbitant fines, business failure, and maybe even-could I dare to dream?-a few months in a minimum-security prison.\n\nAt the very least, even when I acknowledged the many impediments to the former president's facing tangible punishment, I thought Donald Trump was done having a good time. I thought the good times were over for him! I would no longer be forced to see that Trump grin, the little boy's smirk he unleashes when he's truly, actually happy, which is to say when he's being naughty. Naughty as a term, of course, doesn't capture the heights of malevolence he's capable of reaching, on his own or through his various evil proxies within Trumpworld. But it does describe his physical response to his own behavior, his Ain't-I-a-stinker mugging, that shit-eating grin.\n\nThe thing that had driven me most crazy about his four years as president-not the worst part of his presidency, but the thing I'd had to endure day in, day out-was what a good time he clearly was having. He really, sincerely loved leading rallies, and grousing about his enemies, and firing his various Scaramuccis, and tweeting. It made me so unhappy to see that guy so happy, a reverse schadenfreude of the sort I'd never before felt for a public figure. Times had been good for Donald Trump for years and years and years, in direct contravention of the notion that actions have consequences, and by 2021, after so long, I really thought that times would finally not be good. I positively quivered with delight at the idea of Donald Trump having a really, really bad time.\n\nNow it is I who will be having the bad time, again. It's us-Americans. He's very excited about making sure we have a really terrible time. It's not surprising that for many, the visceral response to this information is to try to think about something else instead. To stop reading the news, to refuse to discuss the coming administration, to-and this is just a hypothetical example-put off writing their article about Donald Trump until the very last minute. After all, the four years of Donald Trump's first presidency were dangerous, they were deranged, and above all they were thoroughly exhausting. It was grueling to absorb some new outrage every week, to constantly fear for your children's future, to feel ever at war with one's own country. And now Trump's back, because 49.79607 percent of American voters experienced those same gruesome four years along with me and thought: Sure, we can do that again . Or, really, thought: I liked the way Trump made all those other people feel .\n\nAnd how will we respond? (How will I respond?) The resistance is teetering and, maybe even more terminally, totally embarrassed. How mortifying, to have invested time and emotional energy in marches and phone calls and angry memes and John Oliver monologues and coffee mugs featuring Ruth Bader Ginsburg's ruffly lace collar-and then America elected the same asshole all over again. It did not matter that we strenuously dissented. It did not matter that we, nevertheless, persisted. Public anger at Donald Trump is now the near-exclusive domain of angry Facebook aunts. For many of the rest of us-for me-the response to the election seems to be primarily a grim watchfulness, the miserable anticipation of what fresh hell the news is about to bring.\n\nSometime in his first days or weeks as president, Donald Trump will do something unspeakable-send Navy SEALs into Jutland, or arrest the nation's pasteurizers, or some other shit. Whatever he does will display that familiar Trumpian flair, that mixture of showmanship, stupidity, and malevolent glee that characterizes his every act. How you'll respond to the first outrages of the second Trump administration will vary, depending on how totally exasperated you are at any given moment, and how much danger you and your loved ones are in, and whatever other bit of life you are navigating through. Sometimes you will feel the need to vent. Other times you'll spend a day or two hiding from the news. Sometimes you'll overcome your resistance cringe to spur yourself and others to action. Other times you might make a private contribution that feels as though it might make a difference. But it's worth deciding now: What will be your bright line? What will actually get you out into the streets? A month from now, a year from now, Trump will probably cross that line; when he does, remember the decision you made today.\n\nBecause Donald Trump is happy again. He's positively merry. He kind of can't believe it either, after the four years he's had. The bad times! He had to spend hours pretending to listen to judges. And now: \"Everybody wants to be my friend,\" he marveled at a press conference in December . The parade of notables to Mar-a-Lago suggests that his second term will be very different from his first. Donald Trump was once an unlikely weather event, a blip on the radar, a microburst that could do real damage but that, we believed-I believed-would soon pass. Yes, he represented some real, dangerous transformations in the American populace, but the guy himself? He was a storm we would be able to hunker down and wait out.\n\nThe tech moguls and cable news anchors and soda company CEOs are no longer viewing him that way, and neither should we. He is no longer a weather event. He is the climate we now live in, and like the actual climate, he is getting worse and worse, and his extreme volatility is liable to make everyday occurrences of the kinds of disasters that once seemed impossible. A 100-year flood of bullshit is about to begin. We'd better figure out how to be more than just embarrassed.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

I Guess I Shouldn't Be Surprised Who It Is.\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nIn the seven years since Donald Trump Jr. and Vanessa Trump ended their marriage , Don Jr.'s love life has never strayed far from the spotlight. For most of that time, he was engaged to former Fox News personality and current ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle, whom he only recently parted with in somewhat scandalous fashion . (In lieu of any breakup announcement, Jr. simply went out and about with a new woman, socialite Bettina Anderson, leaving Guilfoyle looking jilted and raising questions about how and why she scored that ambassadorship.) Meanwhile, no one heard much of anything about Vanessa-until Thursday, when it emerged that she is now dating Tiger Woods.\n\nYes, that Tiger Woods, who is having a busy week, having also just announced that he is recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon, while, meanwhile, Barack and Michelle Obama are looking to make a biopic about him. Time for a third-act rewrite to add in Vanessa! The Daily Mail reported that the two have been dating since Thanksgiving. It's unclear exactly how they met, but Vanessa, who is 47, has close ties to the golf world in the form of her and Don Jr.'s oldest daughter, 17-year-old Kai, who is an accomplished golfer. According to Page Six , Kai attends the same school as Woods' two teenage children. Woods, 49, has also known President Donald Trump for years; just last month, the two played golf together and Woods was separately honored at a White House Black History Month event. (I guess DEI is OK if Trump can find a way to make it about golf.)\n\nWhile it is tempting to think that Don Jr. might feel somewhat insecure to know that his ex has moved on with one of the most famous athletes in the world, the only thing we know about Don Jr.'s reaction to this news is that an \"insider\" told People that he is \"cool\" with it. He's usually really level-headed , so that seems right. He and Vanessa were married for 12 years and share five children together; their marriage was plagued by rumors of infidelity and financial tensions. During their divorce, tabloids reported that Vanessa had been \"emboldened\" to file after inheriting a small fortune thanks to her father's investment in Rao's Specialty Foods, which brought her what People called at the time a \"marinara-sauce windfall.\" (As if we needed further confirmation that Don Jr. is sauceless.) The two have been mostly cordial since the split, with Vanessa attending President Donald Trump's second inauguration earlier this year alongside Don Jr.'s new squeeze Anderson, who is reportedly a former friend of hers.\n\nThough it's been a while, you may recall that, in addition to being considered one of the greatest golfers of all time, Tiger Woods is also one of the most notorious cheaters of all time. The revelation of his affairs during his marriage to Swedish model Elin Nordegren, who is the mother of Woods' two children, was huge news in 2009. His romantic life has calmed down somewhat since then-though there was also a spat with an ex-girlfriend over a nondisclosure agreement a couple years ago-but you can see how his history might give some women, er, pause before entering into a new relationship with him. Before Don Jr., by the way, Vanessa was linked to an accused member of the Latin Kings gang, a Saudi prince, and Leonardo DiCaprio. So maybe the concept of red flags is just lost on her.\n\nUltimately, what are we to make of this pairing? Can we count it as a win that it's probably giving Don Jr. a conniption, or is it too depressing that another public figure has become further entrenched in Trumpworld? To be honest, it's probably a little bit of both. A sick part of me, of course, is wondering how Trump himself feels about this news. It takes a lot for me to be at all interested in golf, so kudos to everyone involved for that.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Donald Trump Is Trying to Take American Law Back to 1641\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nPresident Donald Trump teases his desire to be king, but he is, in deadly earnest, trying to become an elected dictator. As I wrote recently, the defining attribute of a dictatorship, as well as of kingship in its ancient and absolute form, is the assertion that law-its making, interpretation, adjudication, and enforcement-is an emanation of the will of one person.\n\nTrump has subjugated Congress, the primary lawmaking branch of government, through complete dominance of the Republican Party. At present, no new statute can pass without Trump's approval. Existing statutes can be ignored without so much as a dissenting murmur from the congressional majority. Similarly, now that a terrorized Republican Senate has abandoned any pretense of independent judgment on Trump's executive branch appointees, Trump has squelched the possibility that his Cabinet or other senior subordinates will suffer an inconvenient outbreak of principled allegiance to the Constitution they swore to uphold.\n\nLikewise, by placing the Justice Department and FBI under the command of minions who have openly declared that these bodies are to be instruments of coercion and vengeance, Trump is crippling the most powerful executive branch guarantor of neutral law enforcement.\n\nDespite these and similar moves, the judiciary at least seems to remain beyond the direct control of the president, standing as a last check on authoritarian rule. There is widespread concern ( which I share ) that Trump may, when push comes to shove, simply ignore judicial orders. But, so far, the adjudicative portion of the American rule-of-law system-the process of finding facts, interpreting the law, applying the law as judicially interpreted to the facts, and issuing orders resolving particular cases-might seem to be unimpaired. However, in the last week, Trump has moved to subvert the neutrality of federal administrative law judges, who make up more than two-thirds of federal judicial officers. If allowed to proceed, this will be a major hit to an independent judiciary.\n\nFederal judges appointed under Article 3 of the Constitution enjoy powerful protections of their independence. They are appointed \" during good behavior ,\" which in practice means for life (absent the vanishingly unlikely eventuality of impeachment), and they enjoy financial security against legislative or executive caprice because their salaries cannot be reduced while they remain in office.\n\nThe tenure and financial security the Constitution affords Article 3 judges are the result of the centuries-long struggle in England and America to protect judicial independence as a pillar of the rule of law.\n\nIn early medieval England, kings personally exercised virtually all the attributes of what we call \"sovereignty.\" They could make law alone, change the law or remit its penalties alone, and sit as judge in particular cases alone. In time, Parliament demanded a coequal share of the power to make statutory law while the power to interpret the law and to adjudicate individual cases was increasingly delegated to law-trained judges. The objective of these developments was to elevate law above the unrestrained and arbitrary will of the monarch.\n\nKings did not surrender their authority over law without a fight. For example, in the late 1400s, they created special so-called prerogative courts, like the infamous Court of Star Chamber, staffed primarily by the king's councilors rather than ordinary judges, in which the rule of decision was derived from the will of the king rather than common law. When Parliament began its struggle against Stuart dynasty authoritarianism, a struggle that would lead to the English Civil War (1642-1651), the execution of King Charles I, and the creation of the English Commonwealth, one of its first acts in 1641 was to abolish the Court of Star Chamber and other prerogative courts controlled directly by the crown.\n\nHowever, even after the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II in 1660, the judges of the ordinary courts were appointed by the king and served durante bene placito regis (during the king's pleasure). As England's lawyers, judges, and sensible parliamentarians recognized, if the monarch could both appoint and remove judges at will, then the law could easily be bent to serve the king's whim. Therefore, when Parliament deposed James II in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and replaced him with King William and Queen Mary, the new monarchs were obliged to agree to the Act of Settlement . Among its other provisions, the act declared that judicial appointments would henceforth continue quamdiu se bene gesserint (during good behavior) and that even incompetent or misbehaving judges could be removed only by vote of both houses of Parliament (essentially a form of impeachment).\n\nMeanwhile, over in British North America, the colonists, too, were acutely aware of the issue of judicial independence. Royal judges sitting in colonial courts were appointed by the monarch, but unlike judges back in England, they could be removed at will. The colonists cast about for another means of ensuring that these judges would be independent, sensitive to local interests, and not entirely beholden to the king.\n\nOne method chosen by the colonists was control over judicial salaries. Judges in places like Massachusetts were customarily paid by appropriation of the colonial legislature, which could withhold or delay payment to judges thought too submissive to British interests. In 1773, Parliament passed a bill granting annual salaries paid by the British government to colonial judges who held their commissions from the crown. The Massachusetts colonists were outraged and threatened any judge who would dare to accept a royal salary. Only one, Chief Justice Peter Oliver , did, whereupon the colonial assembly impeached him (on the frankly absurd ground that by accepting a royal salary he was taking a bribe).\n\nThe point of the Oliver story is that it and similar confrontations between American colonists and the British crown led to the inclusion in the Declaration of Independence of the complaint that King George III \"has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\"\n\nThis complaint, together with the Framers' intimate familiarity with the constitutional arguments involved in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, led directly to the provisions of the Constitution guaranteeing Article 3 federal judges tenure during good behavior and irreducible salaries.\n\nToday, even those who have legitimate concerns about granting federal judges life tenure may feel reassured by the fact that neither Trump nor Elon Musk can fire Article 3 judges or cut off their pay. But most people do not realize that the majority of \"judges\" who adjudicate cases applying federal law are not Article 3 judges with these protections against presidential meddling.\n\nThere are now 865 life-tenured Article 3 judgeships : nine Supreme Court justices, 179 federal appellate court judges, and 677 federal district court (trial) judges. However, there are, in addition, nearly 2,000 federal administrative law judges (ALJs) employed by 28 federal agencies. They are hugely important because they are the trial (and sometimes first-level appellate ) judges for cases arising from federal laws and regulations on admiralty, advertising, antitrust, banking, communications, energy, environmental protection, food and drugs, health and safety, housing, immigration, interstate commerce, international trade, labor-management relations, securities and commodities markets, transportation, and Social Security, Disability, and other benefits claims.\n\nALJs are critical to the lives of individuals because they try disputes over issues like unpaid Social Security or Medicare benefits, allegations of discriminatory employment actions, and immigration status. And they are critical to American business and consumers because they will often be the first trier of fact and interpreter of law in complex disputes over the application of federal regulations to innumerable corners of commerce: banking practices , rules governing farming , challenges to anticompetitive behavior , the safety and availability of food, medicines , and vaccines, and so on.\n\nMost decisions of ALJs are, in theory, ultimately appealable to Article 3 courts, but many, perhaps most, of their verdicts are effectively conclusive. Even in those cases that are appealed, the ALJ's legal and factual findings are given considerable deference and will powerfully influence the final outcome of the case.\n\nOne can easily see, therefore, why it is essential that ALJs, like Article 3 judges, be impartial. If the administrative law system is to be a system of law, ALJs' findings of fact must be based on honest analysis of the evidence presented and their conclusions of law must be grounded in neutral application of statutes, regulations, and precedent. These judges cannot be, or be perceived as being, mere partisan agents of the presidential administration of the moment. To guard against such an eventuality, the law provides that, even though ALJs are employees of the executive branch hired by or with the approval of department heads , once hired, they enjoy special employment protections -they may not be fired, suspended, demoted, or reduced in pay except for \"good cause\" determined after a hearing before the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n\nTrump and his agents have decided that this cadre of neutral judicial officers exercising independent factual and legal judgment within the executive branch must be brought to heel. They have adopted a two-prong approach to achieve this end. First, in an executive order of Feb. 18, 2025 , Trump declared that the sole authoritative opinion in the executive branch on questions of law is that of the president, and that no executive branch \"employee\" acting in his or her official capacity is entitled to express any legal opinion contrary to the president's. For the purposes of this order, administrative law judges are \" employees .\"\n\nSecond, two days later, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris advised Congress that the Trump administration believes laws protecting the independence of ALJs by prohibiting their being fired at will and requiring review of employment actions against them by the Merit Systems Protection Board are unconstitutional and thus unenforceable.\n\nTaken together, these actions amount to a declaration, first, that under Trump no administrative law judge may render a judgment contrary to whatever Trump claims to be his legal opinion, and second, that any ALJ who presumes to issue such an opinion may be immediately dismissed without cause or process. In historical terms, Trump is attempting to abolish all federal administrative law tribunals, at least as courts of law, and put in their place an institution not seen in Anglo-American jurisprudence since 1641-prerogative courts whose judges are both hired and fired at the whim of the chief executive and in which the only acceptable rule of decision is the will of that executive.\n\nUnderstand that if Trump succeeds the result will not be the harmless resurrection of a quaint jurisprudential artifact. The English abolished prerogative courts like the Star Chamber because they were instruments of oppression and vehicles for corruption. But at least in those far-off days there were only a handful of such courts handling a tiny slice of the kingdom's legal business. Trump is trying to seize personal control of two-thirds of the adjudicative capacity of the entire modern administrative state, a set of courts that handle many tens of thousands of cases annually and touch, directly or indirectly, the lives of every American. If he succeeds, the damage to the rule of law in the United States will be incalculable, and his march to dictatorship will have taken another defining step.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Women Who Wanted to Leave Their Husbands Over Politics\n\nMarriage is hardly a new invention. But leaving your husband is, relatively speaking. There's one political party in particular that isn't so happy with that development.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance called no-fault divorce \"one of the great tricks that I think the sexual revolution pulled on the American populace.\" Donald Trump, famously a two-time ex-husband himself, remained mostly quiet on the subject, but for a lot of American women, it felt as if divorce were on the ballot that year. Divorced men, in particular, thought they had a renewed champion: In July 2024, a poll suggested that those men, far more than divorced women or even married men, would be voting for Trump . \"Divorced Men Are Falling For Trump,\" the Cut proclaimed by October . Meanwhile, on social media, women married to registered Republican men talked about their plans to cancel out their husbands' votes. \"I feel like he is voting against mine and our daughters (F7) best interest and her future,\" one woman wrote on Reddit last summer.\n\nFor a few glimmering moments in 2024, it seemed as if white women-Trump's second-biggest voting bloc, who are often married to white men, his first-biggest voting bloc-were going to learn their lesson from 2016. They organized Zoom calls and raised millions upon millions for Kamala Harris' campaign. But many seemed primed to use their personal lives as the ultimate political leverage: Moderate and Democratic women were considering divorcing their Trumpian husbands. Last year, divorce was being discussed as a means of resistance. Whispers on- and offline suggested that women across the country were finally fed up with their Trump-voting husbands, that a second Trump term would mean their marriages were beyond repair.\n\nBut leaving is easier said than done, and it all seemed to hinge on what would happen in November. If Trump lost, would their marriages survive a woman in the White House for once? And if he won, could these women stay with the men who helped put him back in office?\n\nIn three parts of the country-Colorado, Pennsylvania, and California-three straight, working, married white women with Trump-backing husbands told me about how politics had infested their marriages. They had met and married their husbands long before Trump became a problem for them to manage personally. They all had children with these men. They moved cities and bought homes. Meanwhile, they all became the primary breadwinners in their family units.\n\nThen, they spent three election cycles trying to persuade their husbands not to vote for a man who threatened their bodily autonomy, their children's futures, and the very (tattered) fabric of American democracy. From the depths of the election cycle in October all the way to Election Day and beyond, these women weighed their options: stay, or go.\n\nIn October, 54-year-old Beth was a few weeks away from celebrating two decades married to her husband-that is, if they'd be able to make it to their anniversary in November.\n\nWhen they met, as is true for a lot of now-unhappy couples, their relationship felt breezy. \"I was already accustomed to dating men like that, the redneck vanilla guys. He was typical of the pool of eligibles that I fished in as a Midwestern gal,\" she said about meeting him in the early aughts at a college alumni event. The two of them eventually wed and settled down in Colorado. \"People are inclined to say, 'You knew what you were getting.' You don't. I didn't realize what I was getting into.\" She's had a divorce attorney on the line since 2016, though it hasn't gone beyond a few preliminary phone calls.\n\nBeth had already muscled through a few rough years by election time. ( Beth is not her real name; all women in this story were granted pseudonyms to protect them from reprisals, and some small identifying details have been adjusted to ensure anonymity.) In July 2020, mid-COVID lockdown, she was diagnosed with advanced-stage bowel cancer. She went through treatment and has been cancer-free since 2021, but it weakened her body and her spirit and added extra strain on her marriage, which was already starting to turn. She called me from her office, where she works as a lawyer, to avoid her husband's overhearing her malcontent. \"The damage done from the treatment and the surgery is permanent,\" she said.\n\nAmong its brutal impacts is that the chemotherapy has weakened her immune system. That made her husband's refusal to get any of the several COVID-19 shots available to him all the more galling. \"He became radicalized during the pandemic,\" she said. \"When I mentioned to a few people that he didn't get it, people were really offended. Like, You're getting treatment for cancer, and he won't get vaccinated? \" Over time, she got pretty offended too.\n\nWhen their daughter turned 18, around the time vaccines became widely available in Colorado, the fight infected the rest of the family. Her husband didn't want any of the kids to get a vaccination, but their daughter insisted on it. \"I couldn't have been prouder, the way she handled my husband,\" Beth said in October, back when polling data still had Harris up by a point or two. \"She really did a big fuck you . She wasn't taking any shit from him.\"\n\nIt's been through her relationship with her daughter that Beth has started to see the value of filing for divorce after all this time. \"She texted me that she would rather be dead than deal with another Trump presidency,\" Beth said. \"I thought, Wow, this is it .\" She felt she needed to leave him, \"if for no other reason than to stand up for my daughter, showing her that at some point, it comes down to your principles.\"\n\nHer husband had every intention of voting for Trump again, no matter how many arguments he got into about it with his daughter, or his son, or his wife.\n\nFor 30-year-old Annie , a veterinarian from the U.K. who had a baby earlier in the year with her 37-year-old husband, their conflicts were less about his politics and more about how much disregard he had for half the country. Not the half that votes for Democrats, but rather: women. Her husband's views were often pretty liberal; the two of them agreed that the U.S. needed to stop giving Israel arms to bomb Palestinians-they were both hoping for an immediate ceasefire-and he also believed in accessible health care for all. But they kept having arguments about gender, and he just couldn't get his head around voting for a woman. \"I'm not sure I really picked up on the misogyny when we first met,\" she said. \"He wouldn't think of himself as someone who doesn't like women or thinks women are less than.\" But Annie is an immigrant, living stateside in California as an immigrant, with paperwork tied to her husband. To leave him is to also leave the country, where her baby is a citizen.\n\nWhen Annie tried to make sense of her husband's distaste for marginalized groups in power, she came back to his first union. Her husband was married once before, and Annie said he's still angry at how his ex treated him during their marriage. \"That's probably some of the root cause; he almost expects women to hurt him in some way,\" she said. Still, by October, she and her husband were quarreling over his criticisms of Harris' gender and race. \"He feels that elevating the rights of others, specifically people of color, erodes his rights,\" she said. \"That's been a discussion around Harris as well, that maybe they picked her because she's Black and she's a woman.\" Annie's husband had long been more of a third-party voter; in 2024 he was decidedly on the fence about how to vote, toggling between Trump and a third-party candidate (though she couldn't entirely remember which one).\n\nAnnie was also battling against her husband's online habits, which consisted mostly of playing video games and watching others game on platforms like Twitch. \"I think sometimes those people are a little misogynistic in the way they view the world, so he gets his talking points from that, rather than data-driven sources,\" she said. That was bad enough for Annie to tolerate, but they also have an infant son, who isn't yet paying attention to Dad's words but will clue in soon enough. \"I want my son to grow up to know he takes 50 percent of responsibility of everything in the home, in the relationship,\" she said. \"I won't tolerate any kind of misogynistic viewpoints from him at all.\" (Annie said that, despite his views, her husband is an equal parent in the home and is perfectly comfortable with her being the primary breadwinner.)\n\nIf Beth sounded defeated by the state of her marriage, and if Annie was anxiously trying to reform her husband, then 52-year-old Heather was filled with the kind of rage that only divorced women understand .\n\n\"On our second date, he was telling me he never paid attention to the news. He didn't know much,\" she said in October. \"I asked him, 'OK, who's the vice president?' He didn't know! I kind of found it endearing and cute at the time, but it's something that, after the last eight years, has stuck in my mind. He's someone who just doesn't know things.\" But still, she wasn't prepared for how bad his politics would get. After all, he voted for Barack Obama in 2012, and they even attended the White House Christmas party together that year. \"It was the first time he ever voted,\" Heather said. \"He got really into it with me.\"\n\nOriginally from New York-which you can still very much hear in her staccato accent-but now living in Pennsylvania, freelance writer Heather has been married to her husband for 24 years. They have two kids, and she tolerated his uninhibited support for Trump through his first administration, even after one of their children came out as nonbinary and started fighting with their dad about politics. But this time around, things have been harder, particularly with how trans people have been targeted by the Trump campaign, and how much that weighs on their nonbinary child. \"They were like, 'I'm going to show him Project 2025. I'm going to convince him out of it,' \" Heather said. \"I thought I could appeal to his decency, to who he was before. But I can't look at a person who's OK with vile racism and vile misogyny and sexual assault and disgusting xenophobia.\"\n\nMore than any of the other husbands, Heather's is the furthest through the looking glass when it comes to YouTube conspiracy theories. \"He became a 9/11 truther in 2006. He'd say, 'I just ordered this video off eBay-you gotta watch it with me.' It was about how the Bush administration did it, they were the ones who crashed the planes in the tower. Really stupid shit,\" she said. \"I wrote it off.\"\n\nBut then came his conspiracies around Sandy Hook: He claimed that the 20 children murdered in that 2012 mass shooting at an elementary school weren't real. \"I found out about Sandy Hook while I was in my son's class, doing gingerbread houses,\" Heather said. \"Every mother in there was devastated because this news came across on our phones. And this man is telling me it's not real?\"\n\nEven more gallingly, Heather, who used to be a reporter, was stuck trying to convince her husband that the entirety of the news media isn't corrupt, evil, and out to manipulate the American public. She spent days trying to explain to him how news stories are put together, what kinds of photos they use, and why murdered 6-year-old children might not leave behind a treasure trove of online data for amateur sleuths to find. \"He thinks he understands how the media works,\" Heather said. \"He said they're crisis actors.\"\n\nFor all three women, the prospect of four more years of Trump seemed devastating-an impossible task for their already-frayed relationships. That their husbands were determined to vote for Trump again was a betrayal not just of their politics but of their families: They were all raising children under an ethos dichotomous to Trump's. Their hopes were deep with Harris: If she won, then maybe Trump would be defeated for good, and perhaps their marriages would have an opportunity to heal. \"Can I drop this?\" Beth asked herself. \"Can I drop this and keep going if Harris wins?\"\n\nBefore we knew what the election's results would be, all three of the women I was speaking with were toying with the possibility of filing for divorce.\n\nAnnie was steeling herself for bad election results, but also for talking to her husband about possibly leaving the U.S. for good. \"I'd be more comfortable and safer in the U.K. than here,\" she said. \"I would be stupid to stay here and put my own health at risk.\" Their fighting was starting to ramp down at home, even if she knew they were still negotiating huge disagreements. Trump was forcing couples to have arguments over the kinds of things marriage counselors across the world could have never predicted. \"We had an argument about tariffs recently,\" Annie said. \"He didn't really want to listen to my explanation of why it wouldn't work.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as Harris and Biden failed to secure anything close to a ceasefire in Gaza, Annie and her husband were both reaching unknown levels of disillusionment. \"I'm not hugely optimistic,\" she said.\n\nHeather wasn't going to wait around to find out what would happen to no-fault divorce. When I spoke with her right before Election Day, she had already started the divorce process and had plans to put the house on the market for an immediate sale. \"I have filed. It's gotten so clear to me why I don't want to be married to this person anymore,\" she said.\n\nThe stress of her marriage was exacerbated by her own media diet too: While her husband was busy watching YouTube videos about the secret group of elite liberals running the government, Heather was succumbing to her own internet echo chamber. A longtime tweeter, she saw her mentions steadily being overrun by MAGA folks, and she seemed to constantly be going viral in the wrong circles. One especially critical tweet of hers was picked up by one of the YouTubers her husband watches so religiously. He saw the coverage of her public upset and confronted her about it. \"I was sitting there all sheepish,\" she said. \"But you vote for the guy who insults people left and right? And he's mad I told some bot on Twitter 'Fuck you'? That's an issue?\"\n\nThese wounds for Heather go back to 2016, and to the night Trump was elected the first time, thanks to voters like her husband. It was a shock to both of them. \"As soon as we realized what's happening, his jaw dropped and his face went white. I said to him, 'What did you do?' \" she said. \"The next morning, the kids wake up, they hear the news. They're crying. He's trying to calm them down: You trust Daddy, right? Daddy voted for Trump. And that was the end of my marriage.\"\n\nFor Heather, it was already irrelevant even before the election who would win the presidency. Her marriage was ruptured to the point that no possible Democratic win could heal it. \"There's nothing to talk about. What is there to say? I can't do it anymore. He's never respected me, and I realize that. It's not personal. He just doesn't respect women,\" she said. \"I haven't had a normal, sane, intelligent conversation with him in 10 years.\" Heather was moving things around in her at-home office, digging up old paperwork, starting to envision movers taking boxes out and transporting her to her own town house or apartment. She dropped a stack of papers on her desk. \"I can't wait to meet someone I can have an intelligent conversation with.\"\n\nAfter the election, anecdotes about divorce filings started pouring in from all across the country. Everyone seemed to have a friend who had finally broken up with her boyfriend because he voted for Jill Stein. Beth's, Heather's, and Annie's marriages were all up in the air.\n\nThe day after the election, Beth told me, her husband \"stayed in bed all day and didn't leave his room.\" She was grieving Harris' loss with her kids, but it didn't seem as if her victorious husband was feeling all that celebratory. Their first contact after the election, she said, was him accusing her of taking out her election anger on him by hiding his Denver Nuggets jersey. (She vociferously denied this.)\n\nBeth had, days after the election, still barely heard from her husband. Still, she wanted to keep the peace in the coming weeks; she and her family had a beach vacation planned, and it was the only thing keeping Beth going. She was happy to dissociate a bit from her troubled marriage; others were not so accommodating. \"My younger sister knows what's happening, and she's judgy. She wants me to go through with this, but she's like, I can't believe you'd want to go on vacation with him ,\" Beth said. \"I need this trip. My kids deserve this trip. I have no illusions that it'll change anything about how I feel.\"\n\nHer displeasure with her marriage had bloomed-it was no longer just about his voting for Trump, but a lifetime of little failures. \"I didn't get anything for my 50th birthday. No party, no dinner. Thanksgiving is our 20th anniversary, which is ostensibly why we scheduled this trip, but I'm not celebrating a goddamn thing,\" she said. \"What I'm sore about-sad, really-is that I didn't get anything to celebrate beating cancer. That was never mentioned at all.\"\n\nBut she had other things on her plate, aside from the ongoing physical issues following cancer treatment. She was eager for a break at work too, because a discrimination investigation-far from the first she had had to witness ripple through her colleagues-was taking place at her law firm. The morning we spoke, she had to be interviewed by an investigator about just how unhealthy her workplace has become. \"I'm pretty angry because this is the second time I've had to do this inside of five years,\" she said. Beth had been harassed and condescended to at work more times than she could count; her husband doing it at home added insult to injury. \"He thinks I'm an idiot. He tells me that pretty much on a weekly basis, what an idiot I am,\" she said.\n\nBeth had finally come up with her own retort: \"You know what our new word is for them? Mediocre. I've been hearing that a lot lately: mediocre white male.\" When I asked her if she meant that her husband was one of \"them,\" she burst out laughing: \"Yes!\" It sounded as if she were maybe ready to do something about it. \"I can't take the embarrassment any longer,\" Beth said. \"This might sound stupid, but I feel like I have to stand up for my daughter. I have to show her that you don't have to stay in a marriage or any other kind of relationship where someone is emotionally abusive.\"\n\nWithin days of Trump's second election, Heather 's husband had actually moved out. \"He said something stupid like, 'I can't sleep here anymore. I'm worried you guys are going to stab me in my sleep,' \" Heather said. \"I texted him, and so did my daughter, saying to him how we felt, and please don't come home because we can't see you tonight.\" Their voting-age daughter refused to speak to her father beyond that; their nonbinary child told him that he had voted against their rights. Her husband's response? \" 'You don't even know if I voted,' \" Heather recounted. But he had: for Trump, as promised. (Beth's husband did the same. Annie's husband voted third party.)\n\nNo one sounded angrier about the results of the election than Heather. She was angry at Biden, at Harris, at left-leaning voters who declined to vote because of U.S. contributions to Palestinian deaths (\"There is no genocide!\" she told me, something she and her husband actually agreed on), at every nonwhite voter who went red (\"Bye, Muslims and Latinos. If you're stupid enough to vote for Donald Trump after what he said he would do to you, you get what you get!\"), and at everyone else \"too stupid\" to vote blue. She was especially furious with the people who had voted Trump back into office. \"I have nothing left for these people,\" she declared. \"Deport every MAGA out there and put them on an island. They're a danger to the human race.\"\n\nWhile I was on the phone with Heather, there was a knock at her front door: It was a process server, there to serve her husband with the divorce papers she had filed a week earlier. After all, they still share the same address. \"I can't sign for that, right?\" she asked. \"They're my divorce papers.\" The server promised to come back another day.\n\nA few days after Trump's inauguration-when Melania Trump stepped out in her social-distancing hat and sparked a new round of speculation about her own marriage- Heather texted me that she had a \"surprising\" update. Her house remains on the market, and her husband hasn't returned home after he moved out following Election Day. The big update, instead, is that despite filing divorce papers, Heather doesn't want to get divorced anymore. She's now really hoping her husband comes home.\n\n\"I realize I made a major mistake the last nine years. After the election, I turned off cable news and I got my ass off Twitter,\" she says. (She's moved over to Bluesky.) Heather now thinks she pushed her husband toward voting for Trump by having had such a noisy reaction to his support in the first place, eight years ago. \"If I had just had a more reasonable reaction, and talked to him reasonably, maybe he would have listened to me,\" she says. \"He's not right about Donald Trump, but was it important enough to destroy a 25-year marriage? There was a lot of marriage before there was a Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe problem is that Heather's husband doesn't seem to have the same regrets. He's told her that he has no intention of returning to their shared home, or to their marriage at all. So she's still selling the house, and her life is completely in flux. \"I feel heartbroken,\" Heather says. \"I fought for eight years against Trump, because I felt it was the right thing to do. Where did it get me? Trump is president, and no marriage.\"\n\nIn November, Heather was looking forward to going out with someone new whom she might be able to have a \"sane\" conversation with. It turns out, in the intervening weeks, she did go on a few dates, but it wasn't the panacea she was hoping for. \"Sure, we got to talk about Trump, yeah, OK, whatever. They're not the person I was married to for 17 years,\" she says.\n\nHeather's despair over her personal life has led to one unexpected result: She just doesn't give a shit about politics anymore. Her own proud Judaism notwithstanding, even Elon Musk's Nazi salute didn't get her goat the way it might have a few years or even months ago. She's tired. She doesn't want to argue anymore. And while she's continuing her yearslong work with local Democrats to get them elected during the midterms, she no longer wants to talk about politics at the dinner table. \"I don't feel like I'm capitulating to Trump by wanting my marriage back,\" she says. She has succumbed to what she views as the futility of resistance. \"More people think the way he does, and they're living happier lives,\" she says. \"And I just want to lead a happy life.\"\n\nBeth , too, hasn't gone through with a divorce, at least not yet. Her exhaustion still lingers from the first Trump administration, the pandemic, and cancer. She's been overwhelmed by the emotional and tangible process that comes with divorce. She and her family went on that beach vacation, which did help her and her husband with their sniping. For now, they're suspended in a holding pattern, and maybe that's enough until she can chart her next move. She's still conflicted between her own happiness and her sense of duty. \"I feel like I'll be letting people down if I don't proceed with the divorce,\" she says.\n\nBeth did decide to pay a small deposit for a lawyer, the same one she's been talking to since 2016. \"He said, 'Oh, you are not the first client I've had come through the door in the last eight years who has said that Trump is the reason they've come to see me,' \" Beth says. \"He said he's had at least five cases where the woman ended the marriage because she found out who her spouse really was.\" It's not a retainer, but it does mean she has an attorney ready to go if she ever does decide to file. \"I still feel deeply humiliated that he supports this new presidency,\" she says. \"At some point, am I just going to be so disgusted and demoralized that I can't live with this person anymore? I don't know.\"\n\nInstead of fighting with her husband, Beth is preparing for other possible disasters in her future, like if their kids lose their health insurance should Trump wipe out the Affordable Care Act. \"There's no way on God's green earth that I am letting my children go without health insurance,\" she says. \"I will be making sure they have coverage no matter what it takes, even if I have to delay my own retirement.\"\n\nIn the end, it's money that Beth is thinking about most, namely how leaving her husband might penalize her financially in her mid-50s, when she should be gearing up for the retirement she's so looking forward to. If they do divorce, that means they would have their own bank accounts, and he wouldn't have to split expenses with her-including health care for their adult kids if they need it in the future. She's also considering her sizable pension, which could get cut in half if she does leave. \"That pension is the biggest asset we own as a family,\" she says. Emotional freedom is one thing, but what of financial freedom? What kind of life can Beth have if she's working harder and longer to make up for an ugly divorce?\n\nBut it's not as if they aren't fighting right now, even in their postvacation glow. Their latest ugliness was over whether Republican Sen. Deb Fischer's husband declined to shake Kamala Harris' hand while his wife was being sworn into Congress. \"To me, that moment just epitomizes the whole gaslighting aspect. That's a big part of the problem in our marriage, is that he's trying to convince me to not believe what I saw and heard with my own eyes and ears,\" she says. \"I am not crazy, and I am not unreasonable. Don't you dare pull that stuff with me.\"\n\nOnly Annie has a more optimistic view of her marriage in 2025. With Musk's Hitleresque performance still trending, her husband has since grown tired of the shtick. Maybe it's still funny to her husband when someone as out of control as Trump behaves like someone out of control, but a powerful billionaire like Elon Musk doesn't get the same reaction out of him. She showed her husband the video of Musk the night it blew up. \"That's made a few pennies drop,\" she says. \"We were just speechless. Obviously we always knew that was an undercurrent to all of this stuff, but for it to be so blatant, I just couldn't believe it.\"\n\nAnnie says that it feels as if her husband, at long last, is in reality with her, though they're still working on his grasp of feminism and women's rights. Her husband's liberal radicalization has gone so swimmingly, in fact, that he's also considering an out-of-country move. \"We're looking into Hong Kong and Singapore,\" she says. \"Divorce isn't something that I'm thinking about.\"\n\nIn October, before the election results were clear, I asked Beth if she still loved her husband. Based on her own retelling of the late stage of her marriage, he was going to vote against the interests of their kids, he ignored the warnings from his wife, he neglected his family through a pandemic, and he offered almost no flexibility on a political ideology that scared the shit out of his entire family. But once, decades ago, they were just a couple. It used to be just the two of them, in 2000 or 2001 or 2002, when politics somehow seemed simpler. There were, at least, fewer mainstream Nazis to contend with back then. It's hard to walk away from two decades together, two children, and a united path that one day diverged. \"I will love him until my last breath,\" Beth told me.\n\nAs of late February, she's still married to her husband.

      "text": "Lawyers Can Slow a Trump Dictatorship. They Have to Do Something Uncomfortable First.\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nDonald Trump's drive to install himself as elected dictator can succeed only if he destroys the rule of law in the United States. Trump has already eliminated Congress as an independent lawmaking body by reducing the Republican Party-which holds majorities in both houses-to a band of quaking sycophants. In the executive branch, by declaring himself the sole authoritative interpreter of law and systematically firing anyone who dissents or indeed might do so, he has made the Führerprinzip the rule of legal decision .\n\nAt present, all eyes are on the federal judiciary as it considers challenges by state and local governments and private actors to the Trump administration's many illegal initiatives. The conventional thinking is that judges are the last line of defense and that if the courts acquiesce in Trump's grab for dictatorial power or if Trump simply defies judicial orders, as he may have begun to do over the weekend, Trump's triumph will be complete.\n\nThe federal judiciary is certainly key, but it is a mistake to view judges in isolation. The true obstacle between Trump and dictatorship is not the judges alone but the entire legal system and the legal profession-judges and lawyers.\n\nThe law and lawyers handed Trump his biggest setbacks in his first term. Lawyers persuaded judges to block some of Trump's worst executive actions. Lawyers also persuaded judges to reject Trump's phony claims that the 2020 election was rigged. Less appreciated but equally important were the principled lawyers inside the federal government who provided honest legal guidance and repeatedly refused to carry out illegal orders.\n\nThis time around, Trump is taking aim at the entire legal profession. He and his lackeys denigrate judges and may have begun to openly defy the courts. He is firing or attempting to cow honest lawyers within the executive branch. Simultaneously, he is trying to intimidate lawyers in private practice-beginning with prominent firms like Perkins Coie , Covington & Burling, and Paul Weiss -who have opposed him before or might now take cases against him.\n\nThe legal profession as a whole must fight back. It has tools to do so, if it will use them. Consider how the profession can deal with government lawyers who have enlisted in Trump's assault on the rule of law.\n\nThere are three key points:\n\nFirst, Trump needs a large cadre of government lawyers to align with him. He needs them now to defend particular maneuvers in his attack on constitutional order. And if he succeeds in transforming America into a de facto dictatorship, he will need lawyers to staff the remaining Potemkin legal system. All modern dictatorships have maintained the forms of law as legitimizing cover for totalitarian criminality-Hitler's Germany, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China.\n\nSecond, law is an oath-bound, self-regulating profession. You cannot practice any kind of law anywhere in the United States-whether giving contract advice to a local hair salon or representing the U.S. in federal court-unless you are admitted to the bar of at least one state and take an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Admission to state bars is controlled by the profession through varying cooperative arrangements between state courts and state bar associations. Likewise, each state has procedures for disciplining admitted members who have violated the law or professional ethical standards.\n\nThird, federal judges control who can practice in their courts, both by establishing general qualifications for admission and by enforcing disciplinary processes for lawyers who violate the law or professional ethics.\n\nThere will always be some lawyers willing to do an autocrat's bidding, principally fools, cowards, unprincipled careerists, and some sincere, committed fascists. There will also be some who don't quite fit those categories but who will convince themselves that their professional obligation to represent clients zealously extends to bending or obscuring facts or advancing legal theories they privately think outlandish and dangerous.\n\nIndeed, the adversary character of our legal system, with its attendant commitment of lawyers to zealous representation, complicates the suggestion that the legal profession take affirmative steps against government lawyers acting on behalf of even an aggressively authoritarian regime. However, there are, in my view, limits beyond which a government lawyer ought not go, and also limits beyond which a government lawyer absolutely may not go.\n\nAs to the first, government lawyers ought not advance positions that, even if arguably defensible upon strained readings of the Constitution and laws, plainly tend to undermine the basic structure and protections of American constitutionalism. Although government lawyers who espouse such theories should not be, on those grounds, subject to professional discipline, they can-and, I think, should-generally be shunned by the profession. Lawyers who take this road should know that once the Trump era ends, their professional paths will be rocky and they will not be welcomed back into the fraternity of those who believe in the rule of law.\n\nMore concrete measures are available where government lawyers violate the law or ethical rules. But persuading judges and the bar to use them requires people trained to hesitant moderation to recognize the dire, unprecedented challenges the country faces.\n\nConsider as an example the behavior of acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove in seeking dismissal of the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams. The Biden Justice Department indicted Adams for public corruption, Adams cozied up to Trump, including shifting his public position on immigration enforcement, and once Trump was in office, Bove ordered the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office to dismiss all charges against Adams without prejudice. Bove's letter justified the dismissal on the grounds that Adams' indictment and impending trial would affect the mayor's \"ability to support\" federal efforts to stem \"unlawful mass migration and resettlement.\"\n\nCritically, the proposed dismissal without prejudice would give the Trump administration continuing leverage over Adams on immigration enforcement and, indeed, on any other question. Should Adams fail to please the president, new charges could be refiled.\n\nOn Feb. 13, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, resigned rather than dismiss the case. In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Sassoon characterized Bove's proposed resolution of the case as an improper \"bargain.\" Six other Southern District of New York federal prosecutors resigned rather than acquiesce to taking part in Bove's deal.\n\nBove then transferred the case to DOJ's Public Integrity Section, in Washington. The acting head of that section and three other senior section attorneys refused to drop the Adams charges and resigned. The following day, on a video call with remaining section prosecutors, Bove demanded that someone sign the dismissal request within an hour. One senior lawyer did, believing that doing so would save the jobs of the others. As it proved, this sacrifice was in vain. On Tuesday, the Public Integrity Section-the hub of federal anti-corruption prosecutions- was disbanded as a litigating unit.\n\nIn sum, 11 federal prosecutors resigned rather than sign on to Bove's bargain, and an entire section of the Justice Department was demolished in the wake of its reluctance to do so.\n\nBove's bargain is a violation of prosecutorial ethics. The American Bar Association's Standards of the Prosecution Function ( Standard 3-4.4 ) prohibit the exercise of prosecutorial discretion based on \"partisan or other improper political ... considerations.\" And as Sassoon's letter pointed out , the DOJ's own Principles of Federal Prosecution ( Section 9-27.260 ) prohibit initiating or declining charges based on a defendant's \"political association, activities, or beliefs.\" Moreover, there is an arguable case that the Adams dismissal agreement is a form of criminal bribery under 18 USC Section 201(b)(2).\n\nJudge Dale E. Ho is now considering whether to grant Bove's motion to dismiss Adams' case without prejudice under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48. Ho appointed outside counsel, Paul Clement, to brief the question.\n\nClement's brief notes that although the court can deny a motion to dismiss, it cannot force the DOJ to prosecute a case. Therefore, he recommends that the judge dismiss the case, but with prejudice, thus eliminating the feature granting Trump future leverage over the mayor.\n\nThis is a perfectly adequate lawyerly recommendation on the narrow question of how to resolve the motion to dismiss. But Clement goes further, recommending against holding any evidentiary hearing to establish the truth of conflicting factual claims between Bove and the prosecutors who resigned because, says Clement, the essential nature of the conflicting positions is already plain. Here Clement totally misses the boat by either misunderstanding or choosing to ignore the stakes in this case.\n\nThe disputed factual issue is not some trifling misunderstanding between prosecutors and defense counsel over minor terms of a plea agreement, nor is it about a legitimate policy disagreement within layers of the Justice Department hierarchy. Rather, multiple senior federal prosecutors in New York and Washington have expressly, in carefully worded written declarations, or implicitly, through the drastic step of resignation, accused the second-ranking DOJ official of politically tainted, professionally unethical, possibly criminal conduct.\n\nCritically, Ho cannot rely on the established tradition of DOJ independence of the president or the derivative presumption that the department's lawyers are fundamentally honest and that any serious allegation of professional impropriety will be promptly addressed by internal ethics mechanisms or, in a case involving potential criminality, by appointment of a special counsel. The reality is that Bove's behavior in the Adams case manifests an evident top-down policy of transforming the DOJ into an instrument of reward and punishment for presidential allies and foes.\n\nHo and his judicial colleagues confronting analogous cases need to stop thinking like single judges dealing with a single awkward case. Rather, they need to recognize that they are representatives of the justice system and the legal profession confronted with an unapologetic attack on the rule of law. When government lawyers misbehave, federal judges must be more assertive in the exercise of their powers as members of the judicial branch and as integral players in disciplinary mechanisms of the legal profession.\n\nIf confronted by apparent government attorney misconduct or apparent defiance of court orders , judges should first do the very thing Clement rejects-insist on determining the facts. Do not accept vague unsworn platitudes. Put the relevant witnesses, including lawyers, on the stand under oath. Let counsel adverse to the government ask questions. If the case is one like the Adams matter, where the government may be improperly colluding with the other side, judges should ask questions themselves. They should make factual findings. This alone would serve the immensely valuable purpose of advising the public of the judicial view of government misbehavior.\n\nSecond, when appropriate, judges should use their civil contempt powers promptly and sternly. As I have written elsewhere , there is, distressingly, some doubt that the Marshals Service would enforce contempt remedies against executive branch officials. But the test must be conducted. At the worst, direct executive branch defiance of judicial contempt orders will clarify for the public the true nature of the Trump regime.\n\nFinally, if a reasonable basis exists to believe that government lawyers have misrepresented facts to the court or otherwise behaved unethically, judges should promptly refer offenders to disciplinary authorities of the court or the relevant state bar. As the Supreme Court held in Imbler v. Pachtman , the government lawyer \"stands perhaps unique, among officials whose acts could deprive persons of constitutional rights, in his amenability to professional discipline by an association of his peers.\" The organized bar should address judicial referrals of misbehaving government lawyers without hesitation and, when merited, with stringent punishment. Even amoral or timorous lawyers will hesitate to misbehave if it becomes clear that doing so endangers their livelihood.\n\nThe rule of law in America is in peril. The formal institutions created by the Constitution to ensure the survival of the rule of law are wavering. But the idea that law, not one man, should rule is older than the Constitution. That idea is, or should be, the bedrock commitment of the legal profession. Indeed, we lawyers tout it all the time, at least when our professed devotion has no cost. The question now is whether the legal profession will use its power over its own members to ensure that law survives.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why It's So Outrageous That Trump Is Invoking This Obscure 200-Year-Old Wartime Law\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThis week, Donald Trump invoked a law that played a role in one of the darkest moments in American history. Originally passed in 1798, the Alien Enemies Act has rarely been used over the past 200 years. It was most recently deployed during World War II to justify the detention of Japanese noncitizens, shortly before the incarceration of tens of thousands of Japanese Americans.\n\nThe president invoked the law through executive action , directing immigration authorities to target members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, who are \"not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States.\" The order proclaims that these migrants \"are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies,\" and it does not require the government to have evidence or grant a court hearing.\n\nWithin days, multiple flights transported Venezuelan migrants from the U.S. to El Salvador, despite a judge's ordering the deportations to stop. Some of the families of those deported have said their loved ones had no connection with Tren de Aragua and were falsely targeted; in some cases, the families believe, simply because they had visible tattoos. Lawyers representing a group of Venezuelan immigrants suing the Trump administration over its use of the Alien Enemies Act wrote in a recent court document , \"If the president can designate any group as enemy aliens under the act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.\"\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act was never intended to be used this way. The wartime law was created during an era when the U.S. did not have federal immigration policy. To better understand why the law was established and how it's historically been used, I spoke with Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program.\n\nOur conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nShirin Ali: When was the Alien Enemies Act created, and what was the context behind it?\n\nKatherine Yon Ebright: The act was enacted in 1798, during the Quasi-War with France. That was a wholly naval conflict, and it was an undeclared war, or \"imperfect war,\" with France. There was no ground incursion, there was no congressional declaration of war, but there was substantial fear at that time that the war would escalate. So the Congress enacted a series of four laws, commonly known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. Three of those laws applied even before the declaration of war or before some sort of escalation by France.\n\nBut the Alien Enemies Act was for a true all-out war. This meant that if Congress declared war, or France sent a ground invasion, that the native citizens, denizens, and subjects of France-people who were from France, who were born in France, who notionally owed allegiance to France in wartime-could be regulated, be put into internment camps, or be expelled or deported. One of the reasons that Congress felt this was appropriate is that there was basically no criminal or immigration law that existed at the federal level. There was very little national security law that existed at the federal level.\n\nObviously, that is very, very different today, where we have a proliferation of criminal and immigration and national security authorities. The other thing that's worth noting about the context of 1798 is that the law of war, under the law of nations, allowed these noncitizens from the foreign belligerent to be treated as though they were prisoners of war. That is a legal artifact that is no longer true after the adoption of the Geneva Conventions. Today, under the law of war, civilians are supposed to have protections, including against citizenship- or identity-based detentions or internment, as well as against forced repatriation.\n\nHow many times has the Alien Enemies Act been invoked since its passage?\n\nIt's been used in only three major conflicts. Now, of course, we have our fourth invocation of the wartime authority for peacetime immigration enforcement coming down this past Saturday by President Trump.\n\nIn the War of 1812, which was fought with the British, the Alien Enemies Act was used to regulate British subjects who were not allowed to live within 40 miles of the coast. A U.S. marshal told them that they had to relocate to an inland residence. Then, in World War I, this law was used to heavily regulate noncitizens from the foreign belligerent, which was Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. People from those backgrounds were subject to very intense regulation, ranging from limiting travel to preventing them from living in certain places. For example, if you were a German noncitizen, you could not live in Washington-so if you had lived in D.C. for decades but were simply not a U.S. citizen and were born in Germany, you had to get out, subject to internment.\n\nThere were several thousand German and Austro-Hungarian internees from World War I. However, by the time World War II started, there was a general consensus that the wartime hysteria and internment policy of World War I was really inappropriate, and that it inflated people's sense of the dangerousness of Germans and Austro-Hungarians based on their ancestry.\n\nNevertheless, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, we see another invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. Barring the present day, this invocation of the law has been the only use of the authority based on a supposed invasion. But even then, it was in fact a real invasion, because the attack on Pearl Harbor involved hundreds of military aircraft and dozens of armed submarines. We all know the attack on Pearl Harbor and the other Pacific holdings that launched the United States into World War II. That same day, President Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act and imposed draconian regulations on noncitizens of Japanese descent and, the following day, noncitizens of German and Italian descent. Those regulations controlled whether noncitizens could own flashlights, maps, certain books, and firearms. On top of that, they allowed the president or the attorney general to intern anyone who was deemed \"dangerous.\"\n\nThe act does not have due process protections built into it when the president moves against a noncitizen to put them into a camp or to try to expel them. We ended up with 31,000 noncitizens of Japanese, German, and Italian descent who were put into camps based principally on their ancestry or the conflation of their ethnicity with disloyalty and dangerousness. People are more familiar with the incarceration of Japanese Americans, including U.S. citizens, but we still do remember the Alien Enemies Act internments as a shameful part of our history. In fact, some of the internees from the act, those of Japanese descent, received monetary reparations , and Congress even passed an apology bill.\n\nWe are not currently in a war, yet the president has invoked the Alien Enemies Act. What now?\n\nI anticipated that the Trump administration would invoke this act. He'd been promising to do it on the campaign trail, giving stump speeches about how he was going to invoke the law. Then, on Jan. 20, the day of the inauguration, there was reporting that he was going to issue a proclamation claiming that Tren de Aragua was perpetrating an invasion and that that gang was a part of the Venezuelan government. If anything, I am surprised that it took around two months for that proclamation to be released. I think there were probably aspects of the political moment and also some legal concerns within the administration about how they were going to roll out the policy that may have delayed it until now.\n\nThe president is saying that migration and narcotics trafficking constitute an invasion or predatory incursion, but those terms are not defined by the text of the Alien Enemies Act. However, there are other parts of the text of this law that refer to actual hostility and a hostile nation. In 1800 you have James Madison unambiguously writing, in the context of the Alien and Sedition Acts, that \"invasion is an operation of war.\" Then you move to the one time that this law has ever been used based on an invasion or predatory incursion, and it's Pearl Harbor, right? That looks so different from migration and narcotics trafficking that it makes the way that this law has been invoked by Trump, the language undergirding the invocation, frankly a farce.\n\nI think, more or less, what we're going to see today is Venezuelan noncitizens who are going to be designated or deemed to be members of Tren de Aragua without any verifiable evidence or due process. It's going to sweep up innocent people who are not gang members. And there are parts of immigration law that actually allow this government to pursue individuals who are members of Tren de Aragua, if they can prove it before an immigration judge or in a court of law. The only reason to use the wartime authority is to bypass due process and try to target Venezuelans more broadly when you know you can't prove that they're actually gang members. I think that that is a major threat to civil liberties and to our Constitution.\n\nIf the Alien Enemies Act led to such horrific abuses, shouldn't it have been repealed a long time ago?\n\nYes-I think it should have been repealed in that period when we were taking stock of the World War II internments. But as the politics had it, the primary focus of the reparations movement to account for the incarcerations and internments of World War II was Executive Order 9066 . That was the authority under which 110,000 Japanese Americans, including U.S. citizens, were put into camps. As a result, the Alien Enemies Act slid under the radar, but it still is bound up with that shameful history of targeting noncitizens based on their ancestry, not based on their conduct.\n\nMoreover, unlike in 1798, today we have a flurry of different immigration, criminal, and national security authorities that are perfectly adequate. In fact, they are more than adequate for keeping us safe in wartime and in peacetime. Leaving this authority on the books manifestly opens the door to an abuse of a very powerful authority that we have seen in the past violate First Amendment rights, Fourth Amendment rights, arguably Second Amendment rights and Fifth Amendment rights. It's a complete abdication of due process rights and the right to be free from discrimination. I think that even in wartime, this law is neither necessary nor appropriate and therefore can and should be repealed. The fact that it is subject to abuse, as we're now seeing in peacetime, makes repeal particularly urgent.\n\nThere is an ongoing legal battle over the president's use of the Alien Enemies Act, and let's say it eventually goes up to the Supreme Court. How do you think the current slate of justices would interpret this?\n\nI think you could find five votes, maybe more, on the court to turn down an abuse of the act. It is, again, manifestly a wartime authority. The Trump administration is trying to say that migration is an invasion, that narcotics trafficking is a predatory incursion, but the history is remarkably clear that those terms refer to acts of war that trigger the law of war.\n\nThe administration is simply not acting in a manner that is consistent with the belief that we are operating under the law of war. Our commander in chief has not identified any armed attack that would trigger the law of war. He has not asked Congress for a declaration of war. In fact, at the start of this month on Truth Social, he posted that \"the invasion of our country is over,\" based on the low number of border encounters that we saw in February.\n\nI think that you would find five votes on the Supreme Court, maybe more, to say that this action was not taken in good faith, that this action is an obvious mistake or a manifestly unauthorized use of power. And even though the courts typically afford the president substantial deference with respect to sensitive national security matters, here it is just so crystal clear that this is not what that law is for. Also, there's so many civil liberties issues with using the law, whether in wartime or in peacetime, that this simply can't go forward.\n\nAre there other centuries-old laws that the Trump administration could tap into, just as it has with the Alien Enemies Act?\n\nOne big concern that we at the Brennan Center have is around the president's potential use of the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to use the military for domestic civilian law enforcement. There has been some speculation that he might try to invoke that act to assist with immigration enforcement. As a general matter, the military is prohibited from participating in civilian law enforcement, so rounding people up, enforcing criminal law, immigration law. There is a separate statute called the Posse Comitatus Act , which prohibits the military from boots-on-the-ground civilian law enforcement, but the Insurrection Act is a very broad exception to that Posse Comitatus principle.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Subscribe here .\n\nWelcome to The Logoff: Today I'm focusing on powerful private institutions caving to Donald Trump's demands - and a law firm demonstrating another way forward. What's the latest? Donald Trump took back an executive order attacking Paul, Weiss - one of the country's largest law firms - after it agreed to do $40 million worth of free legal work on causes favored by the Trump administration. Trump's order had pulled the firm's security clearances and tried to terminate its federal contracts because it had sued January 6 rioters and because a former partner had worked on a Trump prosecution case. Is this normal? No - but it is part of a trend of powerful private sector institutions bowing to Trump's threats to their business. Columbia University just gave in to Trump's demands after he threatened $400 million in federal funding . And colleges across the country are taking similar steps to protect their own funding. What other choice do they have? To fight. Perkins Coie, another firm whose security clearances Trump targeted, sued. And, last week, a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration from enforcing Trump's order , finding it likely violates the firm's First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights. (In response, the Trump administration today tried to get the judge kicked off the case .) What's the big picture? These are powerful institutions with vast resources. Yes, they're still less powerful than the federal government, and yes, they have plenty to lose. (The Times reports that Paul, Weiss considered its own legal challenge but deemed the financial risk too high.) But we all have even more to lose if the rule of law is replaced by a system in which the president can use the federal government to pursue personal vendettas and enforce compliance with his agenda.\n\nAnd with that, it's time to log off...

He has revealed plans to purge the FBI of his perceived enemies and provided sweeping pardons to his insurrectionist supporters. And he's vowed to launch the \"largest deportation program in American history.\"\n\nTrump appears intent on remaking the executive branch as he sees fit - empowering ally Elon Musk to push aside civil servants, wind down entire agencies, and generally strike terror into the federal workforce.\n\nThe news is changing rapidly. Follow here for the latest updates, analysis, and explainers about Trump's first 100 days in office.\n\nChristian Paz\n\nIt's perhaps the most urgent reason Democrats lost in November: The party has solidly lost the support of working-class voters across the country and doesn't have a solid sense of how to win them back.\n\nNow, a group of Democratic researchers, strategists, and operatives are launching a renewed effort to figure out - and to communicate to the rest of their party - what it is that these voters want, where they think the party went wrong, and how to best respond to their concerns before the 2026 election cycle.\n\nEric Levitz\n\nLast year, a coterie of tech billionaires rallied behind Donald Trump's candidacy. Many had not been lifelong Republicans. In 2016, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared Hillary Clinton the \" obvious choice \" for president, saying Trump's immigration agenda \"makes me sick to my stomach.\" Elon Musk, meanwhile, had once been an Obama-supporting climate hawk . Yet they, and many others in their circles , found their way to supporting an openly authoritarian insurrectionist in 2024.\n\nThey offered many explanations for this decision, some of which were unabashedly self-interested - Trump had promised to limit regulatory scrutiny of their companies and taxation of their capital. But right-wing tech moguls generally insisted that their fundamental concern was for the country, not their profits: Trump's pro-business policies would accelerate economic growth and technological progress - thereby ensuring America's prosperity and global supremacy.\n\nAbdallah Fayyad\n\nMohsen Mahdawi , a Palestinian student at Columbia University, went into a US Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Vermont on Monday for his scheduled naturalization interview. But instead of being granted citizenship, he was arrested and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which started the process to deport him . In a memo reviewed by the New York Times, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed that Mahdawi's activities - like the protests he helped lead at Columbia - undermined US foreign policy and threatened the Middle East peace process.\n\nWhat happened to Mahdawi is alarming on many levels. Mahdawi has legal status as a permanent resident and has lived in the United States for the past decade. He wasn't charged with a crime, but, like Mahmoud Khalil , another Palestinian Columbia student and green card holder, was detained and ordered to be deported simply for having and expressing views that the secretary of state does not like.\n\nPatrick Reis\n\nThis story appeared in the Logoff , a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life.

They were monarchs - the iconic, Halloween-colored butterflies - and they were coming here from the US to rest for the cold winter months.\n\nNearly all of the monarchs east of the Rocky Mountains spend winter in this one forest in Mexico. They often fly more than 2,000 miles to get here, pollinating plants as they go. And by December, there are tens of millions of them in the branches of native fir trees, which droop under their weight. Scientists believe the trees provide just the right temperature and humidity for the butterflies to survive winter before they return north.\n\nKevin Carey\n\nEditor's note , April 14, 4 pm ET : On April 14, after this article was published, Harvard University announced that it would not comply with the Trump administration's demands. This article has been lightly updated to reflect this information.\n\nFor the past month, President Donald Trump has been stalking the richest universities in the world like a horror movie serial killer picking off a group of frightened teenagers one by one. Why aren't they using their multibillion-dollar endowments to fight back?\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nThe facts underlying Noem v. Abrego Garcia are shocking, even by the standards of the Trump administration's treatment of immigrants. The Supreme Court just ruled that the immigrant at the heart of the case get some relief - but that relief is only partial.\n\nIn mid-March, President Donald Trump's government deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where he is currently detained in a notorious prison supposedly reserved for terrorists. He was deported even though, in 2019, an immigration judge had issued an order explicitly forbidding the government from sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador because he faced a \"clear probability of future persecution\" if returned to that nation. This court order is still in effect today.\n\nAndrew Prokop\n\nAfter a week of intensifying market turmoil, President Donald Trump stepped back from the brink of financial crisis Wednesday, announcing a 90-day \"pause\" on the exorbitant tariff levels he'd imposed on dozens of countries.\n\nIt was not a total climbdown: Trump intensified a trade war with China by hiking its tariff level up to 125 percent. And he is also keeping in place a 10 percent tariff for other countries. (Details on exactly which countries remained murky as of mid-Wednesday afternoon.)\n\nDylan Scott\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expanding his crusade to turn back the clock on federal health policy.\n\nHaving undermined the government's support for childhood vaccines amid the worst measles outbreak in years , he is now targeting another longstanding pillar of American public health: water fluoridation.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nIn less than a week, President Donald Trump's tariffs have already created economic chaos in the US and abroad.\n\nOn Wednesday, he announced a minimum 10 percent tariff on almost all imports, with dozens of countries facing far higher rates.\n\nAbdallah Fayyad\n\nSince President Donald Trump announced a slate of new tariffs on about 90 countries last week, global financial markets have tumbled. False reports about a potential pause in tariffs gave Wall Street a brief moment of false hope on Monday, but the White House has only doubled down, threatening to add more tariffs on China. Economists have also raised the alarm, projecting that Trump's tariffs have increased the odds of a recession .\n\nThis is just the latest update to tariff policies that have already caused a good deal of whiplash since Trump took office in January. He threatened to impose tariffs on Colombia and canceled his plan to do so all in a single day. He rolled out a tariff plan for Canada and Mexico, only to postpone implementing it shortly after some tariffs went into effect. And he's been threatening both allies and adversaries with broad and aggressive tariffs for reasons ranging from cracking down on fentanyl to closing a TikTok deal .\n\nDylan Matthews\n\nPresident Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" last week unleashed a set of sweeping tariffs - what he calls \"reciprocal\" tariffs, although they're anything but - on imports from nearly every country in the world. The result has been a tanking stock market, immediate layoffs of US autoworkers , and widespread recession fears .\n\nThe pre-history of this disastrous set of policies, which will only make America poorer and alienate it from its closest allies , is as long and weird as you'd expect from Trump. Part of the story seems to involve him losing an auction in 1988 for a piano used in Casablanca to a Japanese collector, thus confirming that Japan was an economic threat. Sure, fine, that seems par for the course with this guy.\n\nPatrick Reis\n\nThis story appeared in The Logoff , a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life.

But today I want to focus on a story I worry is going under the radar: the president outsourcing national security staffing decisions to a far-right conspiracy theorist.\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nDonald Trump's tariffs were at once predictable and shocking.\n\nPredictable, in the sense that Trump had been crystal-clear about wanting across-the-board tariffs during the campaign. Shocking, because they have been implemented in a manner that appears extreme and incompetent even by previous Trump standards . As a result, the world is historically unsettled: One metric of global economic uncertainty shows higher levels of concern than at any point in the 21st century , worse than the 2008 financial crisis and even the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nOn Thursday, one day after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, what appears to be the first lawsuit challenging those tariffs was filed in a federal court in Florida. That alone isn't particularly surprising. The tariffs are expected to drive up the costs of goods in the United States , and have already sent the stock market into a nose dive. That means that a lot of aggrieved potential plaintiffs have standing to challenge the tariffs in court.\n\nWhat is surprising is that the plaintiff in this particular case, known as Emily Ley Paper v. Trump , is represented by the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), a right-wing legal shop that previously backed Trump's efforts to expand executive power .\n\nNoel King and Gabrielle Berbey\n\nPresident Donald Trump's new tariff chart , which he unveiled Wednesday at the Rose Garden, had a mixture of surprising and predictable countries on the list. A high tariff on China ? Not so surprising. But among the top 10 countries on his chart, eight are in Asia.\n\nMany close US allies like South Korea and Japan were stunned by the steep rate increases applied to their exports.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs are already wreaking economic chaos in the US and abroad.\n\nOn Wednesday, he announced a minimum 10 percent tariff on almost all imports, with dozens of countries facing even higher rates.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nWhen Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought to be confirmed as Donald Trump's secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), he had to overcome a long record of fringe anti-science beliefs. He had indulged in conspiracies about chem trails, questioned whether HIV was the actual cause of AIDS, and, most notably, spread the repeatedly debunked theory that childhood vaccinations could lead to autism.\n\nIn private meetings with senators and public confirmation hearings, he downplayed that record and claimed he wasn't anti-vaccine: \"I am pro-safety,\" Kennedy said in his opening statement at one hearing. \"I believe vaccines have a critical role in health care.\" He gave assurances to Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, an MD and one of the last Republican holdouts on his nomination, that he would not change federal vaccine guidance\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nThe Trump administration's tariffs are, by every reasonable account, an economic catastrophe in the making . So why are they happening?\n\nOne explanation is that this is simply democracy at work. President Donald Trump campaigned on doing more or less exactly what he's just done , and the voting public elected him. So here we are.\n\nKenny Torrella\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited West Virginia on March 28 to promote his \"Make America Healthy Again\" (MAHA) agenda at an event where he cruelly criticized state Gov. Patrick Morrisey's weight. Kennedy suggested that he would host a public weigh-in and celebration once Morrisey had shed 30 pounds, and Kennedy had an idea about how the governor could do it: \"We're going to put him on a carnivore diet,\" Kennedy said.\n\nWeeks before, science journalist and meat enthusiast Nina Teicholz argued in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled \" Meat Will Make America Healthy Again \" that when the US government updates its dietary guidelines this year, it needs to keep meat and other animal proteins firmly at the center of the plate.\n\nChristian Paz\n\nDemocratic voters just won a 10-point landslide in a state that President Donald Trump won last year. How?\n\nThe answer is a defining trend of modern elections: There are two different kinds of electorates who come out to vote in the Trump era.\n\nEric Levitz\n\nDonald Trump has said that \"tariff\" is the \" most beautiful word in the dictionary .\" And throughout his first months in office, he has given Americans plenty of cause for googling that word's definition.\n\nThe president announced Wednesday - a day he dubbed \" Liberation Day \" - that he will impose tariffs of at least 10 percent on all foreign-made goods. For products made in China, the tariff rate will be 34 percent; for those made in Vietnam, it will be 46 percent; for the European Union, it will be 20 percent. Trump framed these tariffs as \"reciprocal,\" meaning that that they match the level of trade restrictions that each foreign nation imposes on US products. But this is not true - Trump's tariffs greatly exceed those of America's targeted trade partners.\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nIn God and Man at Yale , the 1951 book that made William F. Buckley famous, American conservatism's founding father argues that academic freedom is premised on a fiction.\n\nWhile professors claim that they are merely attempting to equip their students with the tools necessary to comprehend the world and succeed in it, they are in fact engaged in conveying a particular set of truths and values to their students - meaning, at the time, liberal and socialist values. In response, Buckley argues, university trustees and administrators should \"banish\" favorable discussion of such ideas from the classroom, replacing them with a curriculum that emphasizes the eternal truths of Christianity and capitalism.\n\nPatrick Reis and Nicole Narea\n\nThis story appeared in The Logoff , a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nNot much, at least not within the legal system.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nThe question of what happens if the Trump administration openly defies a federal court order has hung over the United States since President Donald Trump's second term began. If that happens, it will trigger a constitutional crisis . Now, that long-awaited crisis may be upon us.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump issued a proclamation claiming the authority to deport Venezuelan nationals that, he claims, are members of a criminal gang known as Tren de Aragua . Trump alleges that these foreign nationals may be swiftly removed under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law that has only been invoked three times in American history - the last time in World War II.\n\nGet the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.\n\nTrump's claim is highly dubious. The Alien Enemies Act permits the president to order the removal of all citizens of a foreign nation when there is a \"declared war\" with that nation, or when \"invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government.\"\n\nThe United States is not at war with Venezuela. Nor has the Venezuelan government invaded or even threatened to invade the United States.\n\nNot long after Trump issued his proclamation, on the same Saturday evening, federal Judge James Boasberg issued two orders that temporarily halted it. The first is a temporary restraining order seeking to prevent any deportations from taking place under Trump's proclamation until Boasberg has time to hold a full hearing and determine how to proceed in this case.\n\nThe second order certifies this case, known as J.G.G. v. Trump , as a class action lawsuit concerning \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody\" who are subject to Trump's Saturday proclamation. That order forbids the government from \"removing members of such class (not otherwise subject to removal) pursuant to the Proclamation for 14 days or until further Order of the Court.\"\n\nWhich brings us to the potential constitutional crisis. At a Saturday hearing on this case, lawyers for the plaintiffs told Boasberg that two planes containing Venezuelans who were deported under the proclamation were \" in the air .\" During that hearing, Boasberg ordered that \" those people need to be returned to the United States .\" He also acknowledged, however, that once the planes land and their occupants deplane, he no longer has jurisdiction to order their return.\n\nIn a document filed Monday morning , the plaintiffs' attorneys cite publicly available flight data as well as news reports, which suggest that the Trump administration allowed these planes to land and discharge their passengers after Boasberg issued his order. If that is true, then the Trump administration defied the order and can potentially be held in contempt of court.\n\nMeanwhile, in a second case known as Chehab v. Noem , the federal government may have removed Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a Lebanese national and professor at Brown University's medical school, in violation of a court order requiring the government to give the court 48 hours notice before she is removed. The facts in this case are rapidly evolving, however, and two of her lawyers recently withdrew from the case.\n\nThe Justice Department, for what it is worth, claims that Alawieh was deported after federal authorities found \"sympathetic photos and videos\" regarding the terrorist organization Hezbollah on her phone.\n\nThere is also some uncertainty about the timing of the flights in each of the cases. In the case of the Venezuelan deportations, the document plaintiffs filed Monday primarily asks Boasberg to seek clarification from the government about whether these flights landed and discharged their passengers after the judge's order. It's also possible that these passengers were deported pursuant to some authority other than the Saturday proclamation, in which case Boasberg's order would not apply to them.\n\nYet, even if it turns out that no one was deported illegally, the government still must comply with court orders against it, including temporary orders issued while a judge was trying to determine if the government acted illegally.\n\nThe Trump administration claims that Boasberg exceeded his authority when he issued his orders, and it points to the alleged Hezbollah connection to justify its actions in Dr. Alawieh's case. It's far from clear, however, whether the ultimate merits of either case are relevant at this very early stage of this litigation. If a litigant disagrees with a temporary restraining order, the proper course of action is typically to wait until the judge holds a full hearing on the case and to argue that the order should not be extended. If the judge disagrees, that decision can be appealed to a higher court .\n\nBut a litigant cannot simply defy a court order because they think it is wrong.\n\nIndeed, under normal circumstances, a party that defies a court order can be held in contempt of court and be subject to fines, imprisonment, or other sanctions. But it's far from clear whether such a contempt order could be enforced if Trump is determined to give the middle finger to the judiciary.\n\nAs Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers, the courts \"may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments .\" Federal court orders, including contempt of court orders, are enforced by the US Marshals Service, a law enforcement agency housed in the executive branch of government . So Trump could potentially order the Marshals to not enforce any court order against his administration.\n\nIf that happens, there are few legal mechanisms remaining to make Trump obey the law. The obvious remedy for a president who commits serious legal violations and refuses to comply with court orders against him is impeachment . But, even if a Republican US House would agree to impeach Trump - a highly unlikely proposition - it takes 67 votes in the Senate to remove a president. And the Senate couldn't even find 67 votes to declare Trump ineligible for the presidency after he incited a mob to attack the US Capitol in 2021.\n\nFor now, at least, the J.G.G. case appears to be moving very quickly. And it remains to be seen whether the Trump administration can plausibly argue that its behavior is legal. If it turns out that the administration is determined to violate court orders it does not like, however, then it is likely that the legal system has run out of tools to check Donald Trump.\n\nCorrection, April 23, 4:30 pm: This story originally misstated the year of the January 6 Capitol attack; it was in 2021.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue. But the benefits of fighting his lawless deportations are worth the political risks.\n\nTrade wars are easy to win - if you're China.\n\nWhy the executive order on \"disparate impact\" matters.\n\nWith near daily strikes against Yemen's Houthis, is there an end in sight?\n\nThe latest on the trade war.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

His former national security adviser John Bolton has written that he believes Trump would have followed through on the threat if he'd been reelected in 2020.\n\nThis term, though, despite deepening tensions with Europe, Trump hasn't said much about leaving the alliance. His secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, has avowed , \"The United States remains committed to the NATO alliance and to the defense partnership with Europe. Full stop.\"\n\nAt this point, the better question is whether Trump has effectively made the alliance irrelevant. The US is still a NATO member. But Trump has consistently undermined its core principle that members will treat any attack on another member's territory as an attack on their own, and come to the attacked member's aid.\n\nThis principle of mutual defense only works if both the allies and their adversaries believe that it's credible - that countries would actually put the lives of their own citizens on the line to defend allies.\n\nIn the case of Trump and NATO, the guarantee is getting a lot harder to believe.\n\n\"Would Donald Trump choose to go and fight for Estonia?\" said Dalibor Rohac , a senior fellow and expert on European politics at the American Enterprise Institute. \"I think at some level, it requires a suspension of disbelief to think that he would.\"\n\nTrump's second term has already been far more alarming, from a European perspective than the first, thanks to actions including Trump's abrupt pivot toward Russia in the Ukraine war, the Oval Office humiliation of Volodymyr Zelenskyy, his new tariffs, JD Vance's combative speech at the Munich Security Conference, the territorial threats toward NATO members Canada and Denmark, and reports that the president is considering redeploying troops from Germany to Russia-friendly Hungary.\n\nEuropean leaders might have thought of Trump's first term as an aberration, a bizarre four years followed by a return to normalcy. His return to the White House made clear they may be dealing with a very different United States going forward - one whose security commitments can't be taken for granted in the long run, even if Trump is replaced by another Joe Biden-style transatlanticist in four years.\n\nRecent statements from European leaders suggest they are not so confident about the credibility of America's commitment to the alliance. \"I want to believe that the US will stand by our side, but we have to be ready for that not to be the case,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a recent televised speech to the nation .\n\n\"Strategic autonomy\" from Washington has long been a priority for Macron, and something of a French tradition dating back to the formation of the alliance. It was more surprising to hear Germany's likely incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz, hailing from a center-right party with a strong transatlanticist tradition, say that \"After Donald Trump's statements...it is clear that the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe\" and that Europe must work as quickly as possible to \"achieve independence from the US.\"\n\nSome of this work will involve steps to increase defense spending, military readiness, and aid to Ukraine that are already underway . There have also been increasing conversations on the continent about developing an independent nuclear deterrent, outside of Washington's control.\n\nEither way, it's clear that the alliance that has been the bedrock of Western security strategy for nearly 80 years is no longer what it was. Without actually leaving it, Trump may have simply made NATO irrelevant.\n\nThe core of the NATO alliance is spelled out in Article 5 of the alliance's founding treaty: \"The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.\"\n\nIn the event of such an attack, each member pledges to \"such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\"\n\nIn practice, this guarantee was an effective deterrent to first the Soviet Union, and then Russia, because of the involvement of the United States, the NATO country with by far the largest conventional military and nuclear arsenal.\n\nWashington has had fierce disagreements with other NATO members in the past: the war in Iraq, for example. Trump is also hardly the first president to suggest that America's core interests lie elsewhere - Barack Obama also tried to execute a \" pivot to Asia \" - or that European countries should take more responsibility for their own defense.\n\nBut the current hostility to the very idea of the alliance is unprecedented. \"It has been core to every administration until now to affirm in a positive way that the United States is committed to the defense of Europe, that it is committed to Article 5,\" said Ivo Daalder, who served as US ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration. \"That is the cornerstone of our engagement in the world.\"\n\nBut, Daalder added, \"Trump has, from 2016 onwards, put question marks behind that commitment.\"\n\nIt's not just Trump's threats to leave the alliance. He has called into question whether the US would follow its obligations under the treaty at all. In 2020, he reportedly told European officials , in a closed-door meeting, \"You need to understand that if Europe is under attack, we will never come to help you and to support you.\"\n\nDuring his 2020 campaign, he said he would invite Russia to do \"whatever the hell you want\" to \"delinquent\" members of the alliance.\n\nDuring a recent meeting with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said his \"biggest problem\" with NATO is that he doubts whether the mutual defense clause would work in practice, saying, \"If the United States was in trouble and we called them, we said, we got a problem...do you think they're going to come and protect us? They're supposed to. I'm not so sure.\"\n\nArticle 5 has been invoked exactly once since NATO's founding in 1949: after the 9/11 attacks on the United States. The alliance did come to America's aid. Soldiers from over a dozen NATO countries died in the war in Afghanistan that followed.\n\nThe other ostensible reason for Trump's ire during his first term was the failure of most NATO members to meet a target , set in 2014, of spending at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense. In 2021, just six member countries hit that goal.\n\nBut things have changed since then: 23 of the alliance's 32 members now meet the 2 percent target.\n\nTrump can, with some justification, take a victory lap for this change (though Vladimir Putin surely deserves more credit). And during a meeting at the White House last week, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praised him for prodding members to spend more. But Trump has also upped the ante, saying European countries should be spending 5 percent on defense , more than any NATO country, including the United States currently spends.\n\nNBC recently reported that Trump is considering calibrating America's NATO membership so that it is not bound to defend countries that don't meet a set spending target.\n\nIt's hard to imagine how this would work in practice. The countries on NATO's Eastern flank, like Poland and the Baltic countries, which are the most concerned about being attacked by Russia, are already spending the most on defense. (Officials from these countries often point out that they spend more, as a percentage of GDP, than the United States.) And the right-wing parties in Europe that the Trump administration has publicly aligned itself with, including Viktor Orbán's Fidesz and France's National Rally, are the ones blocking higher defense spending at both a national and continent-wide level.\n\nTrump's calls for higher spending often seem less like a genuine policy demand than a cudgel to wield against an alliance he doesn't much care for in the first place.\n\nTrump's statements, Daalder said, have \"weakened the confidence that allies feel to the point that, I would argue, allies now are no longer convinced that, in fact, the United States is committed to Article 5.\"\n\nAnd if they are no longer convinced, it's fair to ask whether Article 5, de facto, still exists.\n\nFor the moment, \"the dominant strategy for European governments is to kind of try to act as if NATO didn't exist and make sure that they are ready to face the dangers alone,\" Rohac said.\n\nSome of this will involve increasing defense spending and increasing and building up conventional capabilities . Parties in Germany, for instance, agreed this week to a historic deal to exempt defense spending from the country's constitutionally enshrined limits on government borrowing.\n\nBut from its founding, the NATO alliance and Article 5 have also been tied to nuclear strategy and French President Charles de Gaulle's famous question of whether the US would be willing to \"trade New York for Paris\" in the event of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.\n\n\"The ability of the United States to reassure allies that it's willing to destroy itself in a nuclear war to defend them is a difficult case to make under the best of circumstances,\" Daalder said. \"It's a nearly impossible case to make under the present circumstances.\"\n\nEven before Trump returned to office, there had been increasing debate on the continent about whether Europe needs to build out nuclear deterrence independent of Washington. Currently, two European countries have nuclear weapons of their own. Britain's are assigned to NATO, and experts question whether its program could even survive without US support; France has a fully independent deterrent.\n\nThe US also maintains an arsenal of around 100 B61 gravity bombs - the smallest nukes in the US arsenal but still big enough to kill thousands if detonated over a city - in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and Turkey.\n\nIn his recent speech, Macron repeated an offer he has made several times in the past to extend the protection of France's nuclear arsenal to other European countries. In a recent speech, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he was taking Macron's offer seriously and that Poland \"must reach for the most modern capabilities also related to nuclear weapons and modern unconventional weapons.\"\n\nThe ability to rely on the US for nuclear deterrence is one reason far fewer countries have nuclear weapons today than many expected at the dawn of the nuclear age. For instance, the US convinced what was then West Germany to renounce the development of nuclear weapons of its own in exchange for protection under the US nuclear umbrella.\n\nBut if allies concluded that extended deterrence is a sham , further proliferation seems inevitable.\n\nIf NATO allies their doubts about the reliability of Article 5, it seems inevitable that the alliance's adversaries may start to doubt it as well.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has, in many ways, been the ultimate demonstration of the value of NATO: Despite billions of dollars in weapons and aid crossing Ukraine's borders, Russia has not directly attacked Poland or any other NATO country's territory. Hostile as he may be to NATO, Putin does appear to respect Article 5.\n\nBut for how long? \"With the threats that Russia is voicing toward the Baltic states, toward Poland, toward Finland, of course we are worried,\" Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said during a meeting with reporters on a recent visit to Washington. \"Their military capability is growing even while waging full-scale war in Ukraine.\"\n\nGiven the difficulties it's had and is still having in Ukraine, it's hard to imagine Russia launching an all-out invasion of another country, let alone a NATO member, in the next few years. But Russia has been carrying out more alleged \"gray zone\" attacks on Western countries, ranging from election interference to maritime sabotage to arson.\n\nResponding and deterring attacks like these is already a challenge, given the difficulties involved in definitely attributing them to Russia and the fact that they fall short of the kind of armed aggression envisioned in the NATO treaty. But they could well get more aggressive if NATO's commitment to mutual defense starts to look less ironclad.\n\nA future, more Europe-led NATO would likely be focused more on the alliance's original purpose of deterring Russian aggression on the continent, rather than the overseas deployments in places like Afghanistan and Libya.\n\nFor some European policymakers, there is a silver lining to Trump's attitude Though they may not appreciate the crudeness of his approach, many concede he has a point that Europe should take greater responsibility for its own defense and make more of the decisions about its own defense priorities, rather than letting Washington set them.\n\nBut that's going to require a new way of thinking.\n\n\"What will we do for leadership?\" asked Nick Witney, a British former diplomat and EU official, now with the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"For 80 years, that's always been easily solved. We go and ask the Americans, and whatever they say, that's what we should do.\"\n\nThe past 80 years may have been an era in which Europe felt uncomfortably dependent on the US for security, but it's also been a period of unprecedented peace on the continent. A future with less American presence in the alliance will require new ways of thinking and risk old sources of trust reemerging. Some policymakers have raised concerns about the rest of Europe relying on French nuclear weapons as a deterrent, given the real possibility France too could be governed by Russia-friendly right-wing populists in a few years\n\nTrump's actions and statements undoubtedly call the future of US participation in NATO into question, Witney added. But \"no one quite wants to let go of the security blanket.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nWith near daily strikes against Yemen's Houthis, is there an end in sight?\n\nThe latest on the trade war.\n\nBusinesses and consumers are already appearing to panic.\n\nThe political balancing act at the heart of the new conclave.\n\nChina came to Trump's trade war ready to fight.\n\nTrump's tariffs might actually be good for Ukraine.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n﻿\"Move fast and break things\" has no place in government.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nThe conservative philosopher GK Chesterton is known for a parable about two lawmakers who encounter a fence . One, brash and overeager, announces that he can't see the point of the fence so it should be removed. The other, who Chesterton labels the \"more intelligent type of reformer,\" scolds his companion, warning him that they should only remove the fence once they know why it was put there.\n\nThe point is that, before anything is changed, decision-makers should at least know why the thing that they are changing exists, lest they discover its true purpose after its removal ends in disaster.\n\nGet the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.\n\nNever has Chesterton's wisdom been so apparent than the first months of Donald Trump's second term, which, among other things, have seen a broadly worded freeze on domestic spending , a similar pause on foreign aid, and an indiscriminate effort to push as many federal workers out of their jobs as possible. All of these initiatives have had unintended consequences, from defunding a prison full of ISIS fighters to leaving the agency meant to safeguard nuclear material in dire straits.\n\nSome of these decisions were rapidly reversed, but not all of them. And even a temporary error by the government can have catastrophic effects, because the government - unlike the business world - does the kind of work that must be done right every single time.\n\nEvery Social Security recipient must receive their check on time, lest they be unable to make their rent or buy food. Every hospital must be reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid, lest they shut down and leave entire swaths of the country without care. The country still reels from a single terrorist attack that our intelligence and national security communities failed to stop a quarter-century ago.\n\nPerhaps it's not surprising that change is happening so rapidly right now, because there is no meaningful political movement in the United States advocating for a more methodical, conservative approach.\n\nWe need leaders who believe that change should come only after careful deliberation, and that major changes call for even greater deliberation and planning.\n\nThe Republican Party, long the home of American conservatism, is now entirely under the sway of impatient reactionaries. The GOP isn't just the party of Trump; it's the party that made a notorious booster of quack medical theories the Health secretary, and that chose a Fox News host accused of substance abuse and sexual assault to lead the Pentagon - both with near-total support from Republican senators.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, often feel trapped into a role as the sole remaining defenders of institutions, and they chafe against that role. As Neera Tanden, recently President Joe Biden's domestic policy adviser and now the leader of the Center for American Progress, told Politico, \" it's incumbent on us not to be defenders of the status quo .\"\n\nIt's not surprising that neither major party wants to be the voice of this status quo. Americans are discontent - according to Gallup, the last time a majority of the country were satisfied with \"the way things are going in the US,\" George W. Bush was still in his first term . And I am not making the case for stagnation. We don't need to settle for broken systems; we just need to make sure we don't make them worse in the name of \"fixing\" them.\n\nBut as we observe the chaos of Trump's second presidency, where US trade policy can shift wildly over the course of any given day , it's clear that something is out of balance. There is no one - or, at least, no one in a position of power - pushing for thoughtful consideration before half-baked ideas are implemented.\n\nAmerica needs conservative voices. Not the politicians who align themselves with the so-called conservative movement, but policymakers who are conservative in a more traditional sense. That means we need leaders who believe that change should come only after careful deliberation, and that major changes call for even greater deliberation and planning.\n\nAmerica needs lawmakers who instinctively kick the tires on new policies before they will vote for them. It needs a predictable legal system that allows businesses and ordinary Americans to plan for the future. It needs a president who at least asks why the United States provides foreign aid before he blithely cancels all of it. It needs leaders who are reluctant to mess with a good thing.\n\nThe blessings Americans enjoy today - liberal democracy, well-regulated capitalism, a welfare state, and global institutions that have successfully prevented great power conflict and nuclear war - are, to borrow from Edmund Burke, \" an inheritance from our forefathers .\" We sacrifice them at our peril, especially if we welcome chaos and uncertainty as their replacements.\n\nDemocrats are temperamentally ill-suited toward conservatism. It was a Democratic president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who fought a conservative Supreme Court to bring the modern-day welfare and regulatory states into existence. It was another Democrat, Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the legislation breaking the back of Jim Crow . Democrats were America's dominant party when the United States became the world's dominant nation, and they played an outsized role in building the international order that has successfully prevented nuclear war.\n\nToday, large numbers of Democrats expect their party to continue in this tradition, expanding the welfare and regulatory state and extending freedom and prosperity to groups that have historically faced discrimination. Barack Obama, the most successful Democratic president of the last half-century, lends his name to Obamacare, the most significant expansion of federal public benefits in decades. In 2020, the last year the party held a presidential primary, nearly a quarter of Democrats chose Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) , a self-described socialist.\n\nThese voices pushing for shared prosperity are as essential to a just and stable society as voices of caution, and it is important to remember that the affluence modern-day Americans take for granted would not be possible without reformers like Roosevelt or Johnson.\n\nBut the admittedly quite rapid reforms of the New Deal era grew out of a unique economic catastrophe that simply does not exist today. And Johnson's civil rights laws were the culmination of over a century of struggle that included a Civil War. The United States in 2025 does not face the same kind of moral or economic emergency that justifies throwing caution to the wind.\n\nIf Democrats are unaccustomed to thinking as conservatives, they also have a great deal to lose from the kind of smash-and-grab politics that now offers itself as an alternative to America's liberal democratic status quo. And so do the rest of the American people.\n\nAmericans prospered under the business regulations and gradually expanding welfare state that began under Roosevelt, just as they've prospered under the racial, gender, and other forms of legal equality wrestled into law by Johnson. The United States is the wealthiest and most powerful nation in the world - so powerful, in fact, that we've held back the full might of the Russian empire by spending a tiny percentage of our defense budget on Ukraine.\n\nThe entire globe faced economic turmoil and widespread inflation during the years following the Covid-19 pandemic. But no nation weathered this storm better than the United States of America .\n\nCasting aside the most successful policies on the globe is a risky business, as is abandoning the most successful ideological approach to governance in human history. Liberalism, democracy, regulated capitalism, and an economic safety net are all worth defending on the merits.\n\nThose who would abandon this status quo must show that they have somehow discovered a better way of governing a nation than the most successful system ever derived.\n\nRather than attempt to meet this burden, the Republican Party offers only a change in temperament, abandoning the deliberative process that has historically driven the federal government under both Democratic and Republican administrations in favor of ever-shifting calls for swift and disruptive change.\n\nTrump is the embodiment of impulsive change over deliberation and caution, and he heads a party that's been eager for such a leader for quite some time. Before MAGA, there were the slash-and-burn fiscal policies captured by the Ryan Budget, an agenda widely supported by Washington Republicans. Named for former House Speaker Paul Ryan, this budget tried to gut Medicaid and food stamps, kill Obamacare , and, at least in its early forms, repeal Medicare and replace it with a voucher that lost value every year.\n\nBefore the Ryan Budget, there was the Tea Party, a movement that launched the careers of politicians like Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Rand Paul (R-KY), who've argued that a wide range of laws from the ban on child labor to the prohibition on whites-only lunch counters are unconstitutional. Tea Party Republicans also sought to constitutionalize a fiscal policy that was even more draconian than Ryan's vision. Many of this era's Republicans even claimed that Social Security and Medicare are unconstitutional .\n\nDisruption, destruction, and a gleeful desire to bring about avulsive change have been the linchpins of Republican politics for nearly two decades. This is true even in the one branch of government that is supposed to be a bastion of conservatism, because its nine members are the stewards of a fixed Constitution.\n\nAt first glance, Chief Justice John Roberts is as unlike Trump as a man can be. His first marriage is decades-old and ongoing. He presides over Court hearings with an almost-weaponized professionalism. He's long persuaded opinion writers to pen fawning profiles claiming that he's \" worked to persuade his colleagues to put institutional legitimacy above partisanship .\"\n\nBut Roberts is also the driving force behind the Court's decisions holding that America has been so successful in eliminating racism, it must dismantle the very laws that defeated Jim Crow - the equivalent, in Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's words, of \" throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet .\" He also authored Trump v. United States (2024), which gives Trump broad immunity from prosecution for crimes he commits using his official presidential powers.\n\nIndeed, Roberts went so far as to declare, at a time when Trump was a presidential candidate threatening \" retribution \" against his perceived enemies, that, if elected, Trump may order the Justice Department to target anyone he chooses, even if he does so \" for an improper purpose .\" Trump v. United States is one of the most reckless opinions in the Court's history, preemptively giving Trump permission to commit some of the most authoritarian acts he touted as a candidate.\n\nIt fell to Justice Sonia Sotomayor to offer, in dissent, a Chestertonian warning that Roberts's \"single-minded fixation on the President's need for boldness and dispatch ignores the countervailing need for accountability and restraint.\" There is still conservatism to be found on the Supreme Court, it's just that it comes almost exclusively from the Court's Democrats.\n\nAll of this has happened, moreover, despite the fact that Roberts is the most moderate member of the Court's Republican majority, and he is one of the most even-tempered politicians in the country. And yet even his career is marked by the same Trumpian disinhibition that drives the Republican Party.\n\nIt's hard not to envy Germany in this benighted moment in American history. Like the United States, Germany recently had an election. And, like the United States, that election was fueled by the same anti-incumbent sentiment that plagued in-power political parties throughout the globe during the post-pandemic era.\n\nBut the German system, unlike ours, permits more than two parties to thrive. So, while the incumbent Social Democratic Party took a beating and the far right made gains in the German election, the big winner was the Christian Democratic Union , a normal center-right party that governed Germany as recently as 2021.\n\nThe absence of a conservative party in the United States has forced Democrats to do double duty , defending the system that we have while simultaneously pushing for progressive change. That's left them unable to do either job well. The Democratic Party's popularity is at historic lows .\n\nWhat America needs right now is not more stagnation or quick fixes - it is more careful deliberation.\n\nIf the US election had played out like Germany's, electing a conservative government that doesn't threaten constitutional democracy or global stability, the American left could have spent its time out of power making long-term plans for the future, as it has done in the past. Democrats spent most of Bush's second term designing the legislation that became Obamacare , and building political support for it.\n\nNow, by contrast, neither major American party is well-positioned to offer similar solutions. The GOP has become little more than a vehicle for Trump and his inner circle's personal grievances. And the Democratic Party has been stuck in anti-Trump crisis mode for so long that its policy infrastructure has atrophied.\n\nDemocrat-aligned organizations produced hundreds of rapid response pieces clapping back at Trump's outrage of the day during his first term, but there was no Project 2021 to match Republicans' Project 2025 . Now, many top Democrats mistrust those very organizations , which house the policy experts who are supposed to come up with the party's long-term plans when it is out of power. Some mistrust their own staff .\n\nThe fact that America's traditional conservative party has been replaced by reactionary chaosmongers, in other words, does not simply create crises in the present. It is a tax on the future. Endless crises prevent liberal institutions from doing the difficult, deliberative work of coming up with sophisticated solutions to the United States' real problems.\n\nWhat America needs right now is not more stagnation or quick fixes - it is more careful deliberation. If there is a better system than the liberal democratic capitalism that has dominated the United States since the 1960s, then we should embrace it. But we should do so carefully, cautiously, and only after our lawmakers understand why our current system exists and which parts of it are worth retaining.\n\nGovernment should not move as quickly as Twitter. If it does, we are likely to wake up in a world that is far worse than the one that Americans thrived in for nearly a century.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhat the new executive order means for students.\n\nby Anna North\n\nOne of President Donald Trump's biggest targets in his second term has been the Education Department, a federal agency established in 1979 that oversees the enforcement of federal law in schools. He's called the department \" a big con job ,\" and expressed his hope that Linda McMahon, confirmed on March 3 to head the agency, will \"put herself out of a job.\" On March 20, he finally signed a long-expected executive order directing McMahon to dismantle the department.\n\nTrump cannot legally close the Education Department without cooperation from Congress. (During her confirmation hearing, McMahon agreed that congressional action would be necessary , and said some programs would continue.) But the administration has already started making massive changes. In early March, the department announced the layoffs of more than 1,300 workers , bringing the agency to about half the size it was when Trump took office, according to the New York Times . The department's Office of Civil Rights, which enforces federal disability law and anti-discrimination protections in schools, faced especially stark cuts. McMahon said in a Fox News interview on March 11 that the layoffs were part of Trump's plan for the department: \"His directive to me, clearly, is to shut down the Department of Education.\"\n\nIn an email to the department just after her confirmation, McMahon called on staffers to \"join us in this historic final mission,\" which she described as \"a last chance to restore the culture of liberty and excellence that made American education great.\"\n\nThe changes began even before McMahon's confirmation; shortly after Trump took office, the agency's Office of Civil Rights switched its focus from protecting students against racial and disability discrimination to investigating cases of transgender athletes competing in women's sports . Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has slashed research programs , and the administration has laid off dozens of employees - actions that education advocates say amount to eliminating the department in all but name.\n\nThe Education Department's critics misrepresent it as a tool for the federal government to exert control over schools. It's actually an agency tasked with supporting the nation's most underserved students while also overseeing the massive and complex ecosystem of federal student loans - and disrupting those functions could affect students and families across the country.\n\nFirst, let's talk about what the Education Department doesn't do. It does not set K-12 curricula or tell schools what to teach. That's up to states and individual districts. So when Trump says he wants to get rid of the Education Department in order to send education \"back to the states,\" it's somewhat misleading , because state and local governments are already in charge of what kids learn in schools.\n\nWhat the department does do is \"implement all of the federal laws and policies that focus on schools,\" said Dominique Baker, a professor of education and public policy at the University of Delaware. At the K-12 level, a lot of that work involves supporting vulnerable and underserved students, said Kenneth Wong, a professor of education policy at Brown University.\n\nUnder a program known as Title I, the department sends federal money to schools with a high percentage of low-income students to help them hire additional teachers or otherwise bolster core subject areas like reading, Wong said. The federal government makes up about 14 percent of school budgets overall, according to the Associated Press , but low-income schools receive additional funding.\n\nThe department also sends money to states under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), helping schools provide small class sizes and other supports for students with disabilities and learning differences that state governments wouldn't be able to afford on their own.\n\nWhile these programs are important to many elementary, middle, and high schools around the country, the Education Department plays an even bigger role with colleges and universities, Baker said. It makes sure the application for federal financial aid, the FAFSA , is available to students, that the information students enter is sent to colleges, and that the money is actually disbursed.\n\nThe department also helps make sure that for-profit colleges \"aren't scamming students,\" Baker said, by controlling which institutions get access to federal student aid.\n\nTwo other key functions to know about: The Education Department serves as a \"watchdog for student civil rights\" at K-12 schools and colleges, said Blair Wriston, senior manager for government affairs at EdTrust, an education equity nonprofit. If students with disabilities aren't getting the support they need to access their legal right to an education - supports that can range from wheelchair ramps to occupational therapy to a one-on-one aide - their families can file a complaint with the department's Office of Civil Rights. Students and families can also file with the office if they believe they've experienced racial discrimination at school.\n\nAnd through the Institute of Education Sciences, the department conducts research on education around the country, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests , probably the best source of nationwide data on students' reading and math skills . \"The vast majority of any statistics that we know about schooling comes from data that's collected by the federal government,\" Baker said.\n\nTrump cannot fully eliminate the Education Department without help from Congress, and while legislation to do so has been introduced , it's unlikely to pass the closely divided House and Senate. The administration has discussed moving some parts of the department to other agencies - Project 2025, a blueprint for much of the Trump administration's actions thus far, calls for converting Title I funds into grants to the states, and moving the Office of Civil Rights to the Department of Justice.\n\nUntil the executive order on March 20, the administration's approach has mostly been to shrink the department through layoffs and other cuts. In February, DOGE terminated dozens of contracts at the Institute of Education Sciences. Though the cuts reportedly didn't affect the NAEP tests, much of the work of the Institute \"has ground to a standstill,\" Baker said.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 2,000 department employees have left or been terminated since Trump took office, including 1,315 in the mass layoffs on March 11, 63 probationary workers laid off in February, and 572 who accepted voluntary buyouts, according to the New York Times . The department had about 4,133 staffers when Trump took office; it now has fewer than 2,200 .\n\nEven prior to the executive order, the Trump administration and DOGE were \"actively dismantling the department,\" Wriston said.\n\nThat dismantling is having an effect on students. As soon as Trump was inaugurated, the department's processing of disability rights complaints ground to a halt, families told the Associated Press . That left students - including a 12-year-old boy with autism and epilepsy who's been unwillingly assigned to remote schooling - without recourse and, in some cases, losing precious weeks of learning. The agency resumed processing disability cases in mid-February, but cases involving race and gender discrimination remain on hold, according to USA Today .\n\nInstead, the department has focused on trans athletes and all-gender bathrooms . The agency also sent a letter to school leaders saying they could face investigation if they take steps to diversify their teaching staff or recruit students of color for selective programs, according to Chalkbeat .\n\nLayoffs at the Office of Civil Rights could further hamper the department's ability to handle disability and other discrimination cases. The office already had a backlog of such cases under the Biden administration, the Times reported .\n\nMeanwhile, cuts at the Institute of Education Sciences include programs addressing young children's literacy and improving the transition out of high school for students with disabilities, Wriston said. Dismantling the Institute is especially ironic at a time of nationwide concern over declining NAEP scores , he said. \"We're going to gut the agency completely that's doing the real work here of gathering the research and evidence to help inform our practices,\" he said.\n\nWithout the data the institute collects, it will also be more difficult for taxpayers to see the impact that cuts by the federal government might have on kids' education, Baker said.\n\nAt the college level, meanwhile, experts fear a breakdown in the basic systems that allow students to apply for, use, and repay their student loans. Without a functioning Education Department, it's not clear how students' financial information will be collected and sent to universities for financial aid decisions, or who will certify borrowers' income for income-based repayment plans, Baker said. The department already struggled with the rollout of a new FAFSA last year, and given canceled contracts and other changes under the new administration, \"I don't know why anyone would expect smooth sailing next year,\" Baker said.\n\nGutting the research and oversight functions of the department could also make it easier for colleges to lie to students about their graduation rates and the success of their graduates, experts say.\n\nOver the long term, parceling out programs like Title I and IDEA to other departments - each with their own functions and priorities - could weaken those programs' ability to serve the high-needs students they were created to support, Wong said. The Education Department is (or was) full of experts who have spent their careers serving students, and other departments simply won't have the same expertise. And, of course, those other departments are also on the chopping block in the DOGE era, Wriston pointed out.\n\nAs Trump and DOGE move forward with their plans, advocates and voters can respond by \"elevating the stories and the perspectives of impacted communities, of families and students and educators who are being impacted by this,\" Wriston said. \"Those perspectives are critical right now.\"\n\nWhile students and families are the most directly impacted by changes at the Education Department, those changes have also inspired a broader concern. Some of the programs terminated by DOGE are congressionally mandated, and if the president or Musk can simply stop them, \"that means that Congress no longer actually functions,\" Baker said.\n\n\"There are no longer checks and balances for the executive branch,\" Baker said. \"A significant part of this goes beyond education and speaks to a constitutional crisis that shapes the future of our country.\"\n\nUpdate, March 20, 4:40 pm ET: This story was originally published on March 4 and has been updated multiple times, most recently to reflect Trump's executive order to dismantle the Education Department.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe White House shouldn't be a place for people to go enrich themselves.\n\nby Abdallah Fayyad\n\nIn the past week, Donald Trump announced that he would buy a Tesla and advertised the company's vehicles at an event that turned the White House lawn into a showroom benefitting his ally, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He also said that vandalizing Tesla cars - as some demonstrators have done to protest Musk - will be labeled an act of \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nIt's the latest and perhaps most egregious example of the conflicts of interest that have ensnared both Trump and Musk, who is leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a role that has given the world's richest man the ability to target and gut any government agency that draws his ire.\n\nThis isn't anything new. Trump's first term was riddled with unprecedented conflicts of interest . Yet this time around, Trump came into office with even more business entanglements and ways to use the presidency to enrich himself. His social media company, Truth Social, is now a publicly traded company , giving anyone the ability to become a shareholder in the president's business. He and his family members have launched crypto coins . And Trump also has a new set of merchandise licensing deals .\n\nBut when it comes to just how unprecedented the conflicts of interest are in this administration, the Tesla incident shows that Musk is the new elephant in the room. The businessman, who became one of the president's closest advisers after spending hundreds of millions of dollars to help Trump win, is now directly influencing agencies tasked with regulating his own companies. And of course other Trump appointees and nominees - from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to Dr. Mehmet Oz , Trump's pick to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services - are not free from conflicts of interest either.\n\nAt this point, the public seems resigned to the fact that people in power also have massive incentives to enrich themselves. But in truth, there are people and processes that are supposed to protect us from this kind of abuse. What are they, how have they broken down, and how can we get them to work?\n\nA conflict of interest arises when an official's personal interests can cloud their judgement when making decisions on behalf of the public. When foreign officials, for example, spend money at Trump's businesses, they create a conflict of interest for the president because he materially benefits from his relationship with them. And while some conflicts of interest are inevitable and not inherently corrupt, they do increase the risk of corruption, where officials intentionally advance their own personal interests instead of national ones.\n\nEvery branch of government has ethics standards and conflict of interest rules. Though as the ethics scandals with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas have shown, they're not always enforced.\n\nIn the executive branch, conflicts of interest are determined by statutes that apply to all federal employees - like the law prohibiting someone from working on matters where they have a financial interest - and ethics rules that are set up by the White House.\n\nOne major limitation, though, is that these conflict of interest laws do not apply to the president or vice president, which is why Trump is allowed to maintain all of his businesses while serving in the White House.\n\nAs for Musk, there's a reason he hasn't been subject to the same ethics standards as most other government employees. \"The administration has taken pretty significant steps to insulate Mr. Musk from accountability,\" said Donald Sherman, the executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). \"So they made him a special government employee instead of a permanent employee, so he's working for the federal government while also maintaining his day job.\"\n\nThe administration has pointed to that special status - usually given to short-term advisers who sit on temporary advisory committees or task forces - as a reason why Musk doesn't have to make his financial disclosure form public, limiting scrutiny into his businesses' entanglements. (Past administrations have also dubiously granted people special government employee status, as was the case when Huma Abedin worked as an aide to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton while maintaining an outside consulting job .)\n\nSo who is responsible for actually enforcing existing conflict of interest rules where they can be applied?\n\n\"Primarily that has been - within the executive branch - the Office of Government Ethics,\" said Eric Petry, who serves as counsel in the Brennan Center's Elections and Government Program. \"There's also a robust system of inspectors general, who are supposed to expose fraud and waste and conflicts.\" The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) was formed after the Watergate scandal. Before then, conflict of interest cases were mostly handled through criminal investigations and proceedings, but OGE was established to help prevent conflicts of interest from arising in the first place. Tasked with scrutinizing the president's political appointees , the office reviews their financial disclosures, identifies areas where conflicts of interest might arise, and proposes ethics agreements to address those conflicts, including by requiring appointees to sell assets . OGE also maintains a database of officials' disclosures , which are generally available to the public.\n\nInspectors general also play an important role. They are an independent watchdog within a given agency and conduct audits and investigations to ensure that the agency and its employees are complying with the law and to prevent fraud and abuse. While their investigations usually come in the form of a public report, inspectors general can also make referrals to the Department of Justice, where criminal violations can be prosecuted.\n\n\"But,\" as Petry notes, \"you've seen the Trump administration has really been putting those systems under stress or just outright ignoring them.\"\n\nIndeed, Trump has engaged in a full-on assault on these watchdogs, firing the director of OGE as well as at least 17 inspectors general across various federal agencies. Trump's moves also underscore the potential conflicts of interest at play. At least one of the inspectors general he fired was overseeing an investigation into one of Musk's companies. To put it mildly, these firings - which are potentially unlawful - are a major setback for the executive branch's ability to police itself.\n\nObviously, that's by design. From day one, Trump has shown little interest in promoting ethical conduct. One of his first executive orders, for example, rescinded Biden-era ethics rules that prohibited employees from accepting gifts from lobbyists. To be sure, while other administrations haven't exactly been squeaky clean, the way the Trump administration has handled ethics concerns is a departure from its predecessors.\n\n\"Unfortunately within the executive branch, some of the tools that we typically look to to police conflicts are not going to be effective,\" Petry said. \"So that means we look to the other branches of government.\"\n\nThis administration's flagrant disregard for ethics rules underscores that the regulations we already have are clearly not enough. \"It's a real problem that federal conflicts-of-interest laws don't apply to the president and vice president,\" Petry said. \"That's something that Congress can and should change. There are problems here that are sort of systemic that require reform.\" After Trump left office in 2021, there were some efforts to bolster ethics standards and oversight , and ensure that the president and vice president are no longer exempt from conflict of interest rules . But those efforts largely failed.\n\nStill, the different branches of government have to make an active effort to hold each other accountable. Since Trump has undermined the ability of the executive branch to hold itself accountable, the Congress and the courts have to be more vigilant.\n\nIt might seem like it's expecting too much of a Republican-controlled Congress to investigate potential conflicts of interests, but that's the legislative branch's job. It's also not unheard of. During Trump's first term, Republican lawmakers oversaw inquiries into the president's appointees . Former US Rep. Jason Chaffetz, of Utah, for example, called out Michael Flynn , Trump's former national security adviser, for potentially violating the law for not properly disclosing payments from foreign governments. (Flynn pleaded guilty for lying to law enforcement, but the Department of Justice eventually dropped its case against him and Trump granted him a pardon in 2020 .)\n\nWhere Congress falls short, the courts can step in. Trump's firing of the inspectors general, for example, is improper because he neither gave Congress a 30-day notice, as required by law, nor provided a substantive reason for the inspectors general dismissals. So some of those inspectors general have filed a lawsuit against Trump , saying their firing was \"contrary to the rule of law.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately this moment of chaos could be really painful for a lot of people, but hopefully it will generate the backlash and public momentum for changing the system that we saw following the Gilded Age, following Watergate, following other periods of crisis and constitutional uncertainty,\" Petry said.\n\nThat's why the last line of defense against the conflicts of interest plaguing the Trump administration is important. And that is the role of the press and government watchdog groups.\n\nTrump has been able to evade accountability in part because he is more immune to public shaming than other public officials. His corruption has always been brazen and often out in the open. As a result, many people seem desensitized to this kind of abuse of presidential power.\n\nBut while public shaming might not work as effectively on Trump, it can pressure other officials and institutions to take action. Even when there aren't specific remedies to Trump's or Musk's conflicts of interest, shedding light on them for the public to see is an important accountability mechanism because people can demand more of their representatives in government and put pressure on the administration. So the public shouldn't be resigned to the idea that ethics rules are somehow moot under Trump.\n\nAfter all, that's who lawmakers will have to answer to come election time. And it's likely that voters will have some questions about who this administration is really serving.\n\n\"You don't need to be an ethics expert,\" Sherman, of CREW, said, \"to have significant questions about how this administration is operating and whether or not conduct rises to the level of a violation of federal or criminal law.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Could Trump actually get rid of the Department of Education?\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nGetting rid of the agency would cause a lot of harm and wouldn't really change school curriculum.\n\nby Ellen Ioanes\n\nWhile campaigning, President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to dismantle the US Department of Education (DOE), on the basis that the federal education apparatus is \" indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material .\"\n\n\"One thing I'll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education in Washington, DC, and sending all education and education work it needs back to the states,\" Trump said in a 2023 video outlining his education policy goals . \"We want them to run the education of our children because they'll do a much better job of it. You can't do worse.\"\n\nTrump on Tuesday nominated his former Small Business Administration head (and former wrestling executive) Linda McMahon to be the education secretary. Closing the DOE wouldn't be easy, but it isn't impossible - and even if the department remains open, there are certainly ways Trump and McMahon could radically change education in the United States. Here's what's possible.\n\nTechnically, yes.\n\nHowever, \"It would take an act of Congress to take it out,\" Don Kettl, professor emeritus and former dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, told Vox. \"It would take an act of Congress to radically restructure it. And so the question is whether or not there'd be appetite on the Hill for abolishing the department.\"\n\nThat's not such an easy prospect, even though the Republicans look set to take narrow control of the Senate and the House. That's because abolishing the department \"would require 60 votes unless the Republicans abolish the filibuster,\" Jal Mehta, professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, told Vox.\n\nWithout the filibuster rule , legislation would need a simple majority to pass, but senators have been hesitant to get rid of it in recent years. With the filibuster in place, Republicans would need some Democratic senators to join their efforts to kill the department. The likelihood of Democratic senators supporting such a move is almost nonexistent.\n\nThat means the push to unwind the department is probably largely symbolic. And that is the best-case scenario, Jon Valant, director of the Brookings Institution's Brown Center on Education Policy, told Vox. According to Valant, dismantling it would simultaneously damage the US education system while also failing to accomplish Trump's stated goals.\n\nClosing the department \"would wreak havoc across the country,\" Valant said. \"It would cause terrible pain. It would cause terrible pain in parts of the country represented by congressional Republicans too.\"\n\nMuch of that pain would likely fall on the country's most vulnerable students: poor students, students in rural areas, and students with disabilities. That's because the department's civil rights powers help it to support state education systems in providing specialized resources to those students.\n\nFurthermore, much of what Trump and MAGA activists claim the agency is responsible for - like teaching critical race theory and LGBTQ \"ideology\" - isn't actually the purview of the DOE; things like curriculum and teacher choice are already the domain of state departments of education. And only about 10 percent of federal public education funding flows to state boards of education, according to Valant. The rest comes primarily from tax sources, so states and local school districts are already controlling much of the funding structure of their specific public education systems.\n\n\"I find it a little bewildering that the US Department of Education has become such a lightning rod here, in part because I don't know how many people have any idea what the department actually does,\" Valant said.\n\nEven without literally shutting the doors to the federal agency, there could be ways a Trump administration could hollow the DOE and do significant damage, Valant and Kettl said.\n\nThe administration could require the agency to cut the roles of agency employees, particularly those who ideologically disagree with the administration . It could also appoint officials with limited (or no) education expertise, hampering the department's day-to-day work.\n\nTrump officials could also attempt changes to the department's higher education practices. The department is one of several state and nongovernmental institutions involved in college accreditation, for example - and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) has threatened to weaponize the accreditation process against universities he believes to be too \"woke.\"\n\nFinally, Trump could use the department's leadership role to affect policy indirectly: \"There's power that comes from just communicating to states what you would like to see\" being taught in schools, Valant said. \"And there are a lot of state leaders around the country who seem ready to follow that lead.\"\n\nTrump's plans for the department will likely become clearer during McMahon's confirmation hearings. She has been an advocate for the school choice movement , and posted praise for the hands-on education gained through apprenticeships shortly before her nomination was made public.\n\nUpdate, November 20, 11:45 am ET: This story was originally published on November 13 and has been updated to reflect Linda McMahon's nomination for education secretary.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nCanary Mission, the controversial organization targeting student activists, explained.\n\nHow a day off can (and can't) help children.\n\nMany of the justices seemed eager to impose impossible burdens on schools.\n\nThey've dreamed for years of smashing elite universities. Now they're getting their way.\n\nThe Oklahoma charter school case is one of two April cases seeking to remake schools in the religious right's image.\n\nThe \"success sequence\" has many critics, but lawmakers and parents don't seem to care.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "Trump singles out Baltimore schools over math scores while dismantling Department of Education\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 21, 2025 / 12:23 AM EDT / CBS Baltimore\n\nPresident Donald Trump singled out Baltimore schools on Thursday for their math achievement scores as the administration begins dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nMr. Trump signed an executive order that would initiate the process of eliminating the department .\n\nThe president used Baltimore schools as an example, citing the district's inept math scores.\n\n\"In Baltimore, 40% of the high schools have zero students who can do basic mathematics, not even the very simplest of mathematics,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I said, 'Give me your definition of basic,' and they are talking about adding a few numbers together.\"\n\nA fact sheet presented by the White House said that 13 Baltimore City schools had no students who were proficient on a state math test in 2023.\n\nWJZ reached out to the Baltimore City schools for comment but has not heard back.\n\nMeanwhile, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore weighed in.\n\n\"While the President is busy mocking Maryland students' test scores and trying to shutter the doors of the Department of Education, we're fighting for Maryland's students and educators,\" Moore said in a statement. \"Leadership means lifting people up, not punching down.\"\n\nAccording to The Baltimore Banner , Mr. Trump is referring to the students' performances on Maryland's Algebra I test, which covers far more than basic math, but also tests students ' knowledge of functions and systems of equations, among other materials.\n\nThe Banner reports that Achievement Academy at Harbor City High and Excel Academy at Francis M. Wood High - alternative schools designed to help struggling students catch up - are two schools in the report cited by Mr. Trump, along with Joseph C. Briscoe Academy, which serves students with special needs.\n\nBaltimore City high school students didn't fair well with the Algebra I test administered in the spring of 2023, the Banner reports. The Banner says that around 5,000 students took the test, and fewer than 3% passed, according to data shared by the district.\n\nThe data obtained by the Banner showed that Baltimore Polytechnic Institute had the city's best results that year, however, roughly a quarter of the school's students passed.\n\nBaltimore City schools told the Banner that in 2024, the share of Baltimore high school students who passed the Algebra I test grew to nearly 6%.\n\nThe 2024 Nation's Report Card from January showed Baltimore City students made little progress in mathematics and even less in reading proficiency between 2022 and 2024.\n\nAccording to the report , in 2024, the average math score of 209 for fourth graders in Baltimore City schools was higher than its average of 201 in 2022. The 2024 average was lower than its average score of 222 in 2009, the report shows.\n\n\"Our fourth-grade math performance is encouraging. We know our approaches are working, our families are supporting the work, and our staff continue to push boundaries for our young people to reach their potential,\" said Dr. Sonja Santelises, chief executive officer of City Schools. \"Our focus is to continue the momentum of our acceleration efforts to reach more students.\"\n\nThe average eighth-grade math score of 245 was the same as in 2022 and lower than their average of 257 in 2009, per the report.\n\nThe national test also revealed score gaps between student groups in 2024. For example, Black students in eighth grade had an average math score that was 39 points lower than the score for White students.\n\nAmong fourth graders, students who were identified as being economically disadvantaged had an average score that was 15 points lower than those who were not economically disadvantaged, the test results showed. The performance gap was similar in 2009.\n\nDr. Santelises said City Schools have been focused on improving math skills. She said they even launched a new curriculum for some students.\n\n\"We will go fully across the district this coming school year,\" she said. \"But I think, most importantly, what the families and public can take to heart are some real key pieces. One, the teachers and principals say overwhelmingly it was the professional development.\"\n\nThe 2024 graduation rate for Maryland high schools reached 87.6% in 2024, the highest level since 2017, according to the State Department of Education (MSDE).\n\nThe 2024 graduation rate was 1.8 percentage points higher than in the 2022-23 school year. Hispanic students and multilingual learners saw the largest increase among student groups.\n\nThe latest data represents students who began high school during the 2020-21 school year, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn Anne Arundel County , the 2024 graduation rate rose by almost one percentage point, compared to 2023, according to data from MSDE.\n\nBaltimore County recorded a high school graduation rate of 85.8% in 2024, an increase of nearly one percentage point from the previous year.\n\nBaltimore City schools had a graduation rate of 71% in 2024, up from 69% in 2023.\n\nThe Blueprint for Maryland's Future education plan  became law in 2021 after the General Assembly overrode a veto of the bill by former Gov. Larry Hogan. The Kirwan Commission was formed in 2016 and worked for three years to develop the Blueprint based on best practices to help the state's poorest schools.\n\nThe education plan sought to bolster spending in high-concentration poverty schools and uplift students who need additional services to succeed in underserved districts.\n\nEarlier this month, Maryland's House of Delegates voted along party lines to modify parts of Gov. Wes Moore's plan for the Blueprint education plan, according to The Baltimore Banner .\n\nThe Banner says the legislation no longer carries some of the reforms sought by Moore, including a multi-year pause on a plan to increase planning time for teachers. Delegates opted for only a one-year pause instead.\n\nThe legislation includes programs to recruit and better train teachers, according to the Banner, and state delegates rejected proposed cuts to funding for community schools.\n\nThe Banner says state delegates also rejected Moore's proposed cuts to planned increased per-pupil funding for students in poverty and those learning English, and freezing funding levels for community schools, which offer extra services to students and their families in high-poverty neighborhoods.\n\nOn March 17, Maryland students and education advocates rallied in front of the State House in opposition to potential cuts in the 2026 proposed budget.\n\nRally organizers said Gov. Wes Moore's proposed budget includes cuts to education that would strip essential resources from schools and disproportionately impact students with the highest needs.\n\n\"It's students from across Maryland coming together under one mission, to fight for education and fight back against a lot of the education cuts,\" said Riya Gupta, the interim executive director of Strong Schools Maryland.\n\nStudents gathered to speak out about cuts to community schools, the Blueprint for Maryland's Future , and disability and behavioral health resources, among others.\n\n\"We want (lawmakers) to maintain their promise to the Blueprint,\" Gupta said. \"In 2021, the governor, the legislature, made a promise to students, and now they are here four years later, stepping back on that promise, and we are here fighting against that. I think it is incredible.\"\n\nMr. Trump says the United States ranks near the bottom of the world in education.\n\nAccording to CBS News , Mr. Trump claimed that 70% of eighth graders \"are not proficient in either reading or math,\" and \"40% of fourth graders lack even basic reading skills.\"\n\nThe president said that the administration would be returning education \"back to the states, where it belongs,\" CBS News reports.\n\n\"We're going to eliminate it, and everybody knows it's right,\" the president said of the department at the White House Thursday. He added, \"We're not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven't for a long time.\"\n\nMr. Trump's administration, along with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has already cut nearly half of the education department's workforce .\n\nCBS News reports that fully eliminating the Department of Education would require an act of Congress.\n\nAdam Thompson is a digital content producer for CBS Baltimore.\n\n© 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "Americans say Trump is changing how government works, but divide over Musk, workforce cuts - CBS News poll\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 2, 2025 / 2:14 PM EST / CBS News\n\nThere's at least one thing Americans widely agree on about President Donald Trump: they think he's changing the way the government works.\n\nBut they're more split on whether that's for the better or worse.\n\nHis approach to immigration and deportation continues to receive positive marks, and his border policies are seen as effective. A large majority agree there is some waste in the federal government.\n\nDOGE and Elon Musk's efforts divide the nation, though, as Americans foresee an impact from dismissing federal workers. Half the country thinks this will cut their services and remove essential people. Half think it'll save money.\n\nEither way, it isn't the main issue they want Mr. Trump focused on. They overwhelmingly say he should prioritize inflation and the economy, and far fewer think he actually is.\n\nThe people who think Mr. Trump is changing the government for the better - who include a lot of Republicans and people who voted for him - overwhelmingly approve of things like his policies on deportation and his efforts to reduce the federal workforce. They would specifically give Elon Musk and DOGE a lot of influence.\n\nThose who see major changes for the worse - most Democrats and those who didn't back him - go the other way on all of this. Most of them don't think Musk and DOGE ought to have any influence. They see reductions in the workforce as eliminating essential workers and as having the effect of consolidating Mr. Trump's power.\n\nMost Americans see a wide range of potential impacts from the federal workforce reductions.\n\nFor most Republicans, these reductions will lead to efficiencies and savings.\n\nFor Democrats, it'll remove essential workers, and they also see political impacts: removing workers who don't support him and conferring more power on Mr. Trump.\n\nThe public is on balance wary of Musk and DOGE's access to government agency data records. Democrats and independents think he has too much access, but Republicans either say he has the right amount or would give him more.\n\nThat said, most do think there is at least some waste in the federal government, and that view crosses party lines. But they differ on how much and what causes it: Republicans think there is a lot, mostly caused by fraud in the system, while Democrats think there is only some, mostly caused by poor spending decisions.\n\nMr. Trump gets narrowly positive ratings for handling the economy, but not inflation specifically.\n\nThere's a big difference between what Americans think Mr. Trump ought to give high priority and what they think he is prioritizing.\n\nThey overwhelmingly want Mr. Trump focused on the economy and inflation. That cuts across partisan lines. (Perhaps no surprise there, as they've been among Americans' top issues for years.)\n\nThe percent who think he is giving a lot of priority to the economy and inflation, though, is far lower.\n\nMost think he is prioritizing the border, the federal workforce and tariffs, more so than inflation. And his policies aren't seen as driving down food and grocery prices.\n\nThe focus on the border does help him politically: he gets approval on his handling of immigration, and most continue to back his deportation policy. Most say his policies are reducing the number of migrants crossing the border.\n\nThat all leaves Mr. Trump's approval rating in positive territory, but more closely divided than a couple of weeks ago.\n\nIn all, Republicans now overwhelmingly think things in the country are going at least somewhat well, which has driven up the overall percentage of Americans who are saying that since Mr. Trump took office.\n\nAmericans also think there are major changes happening with U.S. international relations. And again here, a split on whether that is better or worse.\n\nInterviewing for the poll was almost entirely conducted prior to the Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nAmericans overall want to remain engaged on the world stage. Though few think the U.S. should take the leading role in the world, most do think it should work alongside its allies.\n\nAnd most see the nations of Western Europe collectively (Great Britain, France, Germany and Italy) as allies of the U.S.\n\nHalf of Americans say they back Ukraine in the conflict with Russia, almost half are neutral.\n\nIn interviews largely conducted prior to the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting, few Americans thought Mr. Trump favored Ukraine in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.\n\nThose who personally support Ukraine overwhelmingly say Mr. Trump favored Russia, while those who don't pick a side overwhelmingly say he's treated them equally.\n\nHis handling of the conflict is largely split along party lines.\n\nMost Americans do continue to see Russia as unfriendly or an enemy. Republicans are comparably less inclined to see it as an enemy than are Americans overall.\n\nThe nation continues to divide along partisan lines over military aid to Ukraine.\n\nThis CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,311 U.S. adults interviewed between Feb. 26-28, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

      "text": "Controversy arises after President Trump criticizes low math scores in Baltimore schools\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 23, 2025 / 10:50 PM EDT / CBS Baltimore\n\nPresident Donald Trump's comments on low math schools at Baltimore City schools had many people in the city talking.\n\n\"In Baltimore, 40% of the high schools have zero students who can do basic mathematics. Not even the very simplest of mathematics,\" President Trump said during an address on dismantling the Department of Education Thursday.\n\nSome parents expressed disappointment with his message.\n\n\"It's frustrating seeing someone who's not really that familiar with the city having little faith in the students,\" said parent Echo Cahoon.\n\n\"How is it that you can talk about something you know absolutely nothing about?\"  another parent, Chanell Gross, said.\n\nOthers shared their thoughts online under WJZ's post about Trump's comments. Some agreed, saying \"But was he wrong?\", \"...math scores fall on the teachers\" and \"hate to say this...but he's right.\"\n\nMayor Brandon Scott also took to social media in response to Trump's comments.\n\n\"Here is some math for those who are all of a sudden mathematicians. Baltimore City math scores increased 5x the rate of statewide math scores last year. Yet, we aren't celebrating because we have much more work to do. Maybe the administration should help instead of treating the Department of Education like the WWE Royal Rumble.\"\n\nAccording to The Baltimore Banner , Trump is referring to the students' performances on Maryland's Algebra I test, which covers far more than basic math, but also tests students' knowledge of functions and systems of equations, among other concepts.\n\nGoing back to January, the 2024 Nation's Report Card revealed city students showed little progress when it came to math. In January, City Schools CEO, Dr. Sonja Santelises, told WJZ the district launched a new curriculum for students, adding coaching and refresher courses that will build math scores.\n\n\"We will go fully across the district this coming school year,\" she said. \"But I think, most importantly, what the families and public can take to heart are some real key pieces. One, the teachers and principals say overwhelmingly it was the professional development.\"\n\nBaltimore City Public Schools said they didn't have anything to add to the president's comments.\n\nThey said school data shows math skills are improving. The data reveals seven out of eight grade levels experienced growth on the MCAP math assessment between the 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 school year.\n\nCity Schools also note that math proficiency grew by 1.8% following the pandemic.\n\nKaicey Baylor joined WJZ as a reporter in October 2024.  Before coming to Charm City, she spent the last three years as a morning reporter and multiskilled journalist at 13News Now in Norfolk, Virginia.\r\nShe covered several stories including the Chesapeake Walmart mass shooting, the Richneck Elementary shooting, as well as anti-gun violence advocates working to repair their communities.\n\n© 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "website": "https://www.cnn.com",
      "text": "Fact check: Trump exaggerates trade deficits, his 2024 vote total, Ukraine aid, border crossings and fentanyl deaths\n\nFollow:\n\nPresident Donald Trump made at least nine false claims in his Friday remarks to reporters in the Oval Office - including a series of wildly exaggerated statistics on a variety of topics.\n\nTrump used inaccurate figures for the number of votes he received in the 2024 presidential election, US aid to Ukraine, the number of migrants who entered the US during the Biden administration, the US trade deficits with China and Canada, and annual US fentanyl deaths.\n\nHe also wrongly declared, again, that Honda announced it is building a new factory in Indiana. He repeated his years-old baseless claim that NATO would no longer have existed if not for his first presidency. He told his familiar unsubstantiated story about large numbers of migrants having come from jails in \"the Congo\" and elsewhere. And he once more discussed Canada's dairy tariffs without mentioning a critical fact about them.\n\nHere is a fact check.\n\nWhile criticizing a federal judge who is presiding over a challenge to one of Trump's immigration actions, Trump exaggerated his own vote total in the 2024 election - saying of the judge, \"He didn't run for president. He didn't get much more than 80 million votes.\" Trump received about 77.3 million votes in the 2024 election, his highest total in the three consecutive presidential elections in which he was a candidate. There is no basis for his repeated suggestions that the 2024 count was inaccurate.\n\nHonda and Indiana : While touting his use of tariffs on imported goods to get companies to increase their US manufacturing, Trump claimed, as he did in his address to Congress early this month, that Honda is building a new factory in Indiana.\n\n\"We have a big one: Honda is building - just announced - a really big plant in Indiana,\" he said Friday.\n\nBut Honda has made no such announcement. Reuters, citing anonymous sources, reported early this month that Honda is planning to build its next-generation Civic hybrid in Indiana rather than Mexico as originally planned. The report did not say Honda was building a new factory; it already builds vehicles at an existing Indiana plant .\n\nIn a statement to CNN on Wednesday, Honda thanked Trump \"for recognizing our commitment to manufacturing vehicles in America\" and touted its investment of \"over $3 billion in advanced vehicle manufacturing in America in just the past three years\" - but also noted, \"Honda did not announce plans for a new plant in the U.S. at this time.\" Honda said Friday, after Trump's latest remarks, that this statement still stands.\n\nThe US trade deficit with China : Trump repeated his false claim that the US trade deficit with China has hit $1 trillion or more, again blaming former President Joe Biden for this supposed situation. Trump said: \"We have a trillion-dollar deficit, because of Biden, with President Xi; more than that - I mean, I've heard $1.2 trillion.\"\n\nThose numbers are not close to accurate. In fact, official federal figures show that the 2024 deficit with China in goods and services trade was $263.3 billion. That's up from $252.1 billion in 2023 - but lower than in every year of Trump's first presidency. The 2024 deficit with China in goods trade alone was $295.2 billion.\n\nThe US trade deficit with Canada : Reiterating his desire for Canada to become the 51st US state, Trump repeated his false claim that \"it costs us $200 billion a year in subsidy to keep Canada afloat.\" Trump has repeatedly used this $200 billion figure to describe the US trade deficit with Canada, which is actually far lower than that; official US statistics show the 2024 deficit with Canada in goods and services trade was $35.7 billion and $70.6 billion in goods trade alone. Even if he was this time using the word \"subsidy\" more broadly, there is no basis for the claim .\n\nCanada's dairy tariffs : Trump correctly noted that Canada has 270% tariffs on some US dairy products. However, he failed to mention that Canada's high dairy tariffs only kick in after the US hits a certain Trump-negotiated quantity of tariff-free dairy sales to Canada each year - and as the US dairy industry acknowledges , the US is not hitting its zero-tariff maximum in any category of dairy product, so the tariffs aren't being applied. You can read more here .\n\nUS aid to Ukraine : Trump repeated his regular false claim that the US has provided \"$350 billion\" in aid to Ukraine. There is no basis for this figure. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine , the US had committed about $129 billion in total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December 2024 (at current exchange rates) and actually allocated about $123 billion of that sum.\n\nIt's possible to arrive at different totals using different counting methodologies, but there is no apparent basis for Trump's \"$350 billion\" figure. The US government inspector general overseeing the Ukraine response says on its website that the US had appropriated about $183 billion for the Ukraine response through December 2024, including about $83 billion actually disbursed  -  and that includes funding spent in the US or sent to countries other than Ukraine .\n\nThe existence of NATO : Trump repeated his false claim that \"NATO was gone until I came along,\" since he convinced member countries to spend more on defense. There is no basis for the claim that NATO was vanishing without him. One expert on NATO, George Washington University professor Erwan Lagadec , told CNN in 2023 , when Trump made similar comments, that the claim \"doesn't make sense, obviously,\" since the only NATO member that had given any indication in recent years that it was thinking about leaving the alliance was the US itself under Trump.\n\nThis time, Trump claimed that both the current secretary general of NATO, Mark Rutte, and his predecessor, Jens Stoltenberg, said, \"If it wasn't for Trump you wouldn't even have a NATO.\" It's not clear what they might have told Trump in private, but neither went nearly that far in public. Both Rutte and Stoltenberg publicly praised Trump for achieving increases in NATO members' defense spending but didn't go so far as saying the alliance would have disappeared without him.\n\nNATO members' spending : Trump repeated his false claim that, before his first presidency, some NATO countries \"weren't paying their bills.\" NATO's target of having its members each spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense is a self-described \"guideline \" that does not create \"bills\"; during and prior to Trump's first presidency, the guideline was written in forgiving language that made clear that it was not a firm commitment. That version of the guideline, created at a NATO summit in Wales in 2014, said members that had yet to reach 2% would \"aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade with a view to meeting their NATO Capability Targets and filling NATO's capability shortfalls.\" In other words, the members that were below 2% in 2014 didn't even have to promise to hit the target by 2024 - simply to make an effort to do so by then.\n\nThe number of migrants : Trump repeated his false claim that \"21 million\" migrants were allowed into the country by the Biden administration, \"not even including the gotaways\" who evaded detection. This is another major exaggeration. Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the country had recorded under 11 million nationwide \"encounters\" with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there's no way the total is \"21 million.\"\n\nImmigration, prisons and mental institutions : Trump repeated his regular but unsubstantiated claim that \"many\" migrants who crossed the border during the Biden administration \"were from jails and prisons and mental institutions,\" adding that \"many\" came from jails in South America, Africa and \"the Congo\" in particular. Trump has never provided proof for these claims, which his own presidential campaign was unable to corroborate; experts on both the Democratic Republic of Congo and the neighboring Republic of Congo have told CNN there is no evidence for Trump's previous claims that \"the Congo\" deliberately emptied prisons to somehow send inmates to the US as migrants; and the government of each of these countries has told CNN that the claims are baseless.\n\nFentanyl deaths : Talking about the border and drug trafficking, Trump repeated his inaccurate rejection of official statistics on fentanyl overdose deaths: \"I think the number is much higher than the 125 (thousand), 115 (thousand) that you - I think it's closer to 300,000 people a year.\"\n\nThere is no basis for Trump's opinion. In the 12-month period ending in October 2024, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there were 52,385 deaths involving synthetic opioids including fentanyl - a terrible number, but nowhere close to what Trump said. Even at the peak, US deaths involving synthetic opioids hovered under 80,000 for any given 12-month period.\n\nWhen Trump made similar \"300,000\" claims in 2024, Dr. Andrew Kolodny , medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University, told CNN that this is \"a made-up number,\" saying, \"I have no idea where Trump is getting '300,000' from.\"\n\nKolodny said it's likely that the number of US overdose deaths is undercounted, but that there is no apparent basis for Trump's insistence that the real number is nearly triple the reported number. And Kolodny said the undercount issue is centered not on overdoses from illicit fentanyl smuggled across the southern border but on seniors' overdoses from accidentally taking too much of their legal prescription medications.\n\nTrump claimed that, during the riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, \"nobody was killed\" other than Ashli Babbitt, a rioter who was shot by a police officer as she tried to climb through a broken window into the Speaker's Lobby outside the House of Representatives.\n\nWe won't call Trump's claim false, but it's worth noting that Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with pepper spray during the riot , died after suffering strokes the next day. (The chief medical examiner for Washington, DC, found that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also told the Washington Post that \"all that transpired played a role in his condition.\" Experts subsequently noted to CNN that stressful or traumatic events can lead to strokes.) And three other Trump supporters who were at the Capitol on January 6 died in medical emergencies, two from natural causes and one from accidental amphetamine intoxication, according to the chief medical examiner.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "March 21, 2025: Donald Trump presidency news\n\n• Immigration fight: A federal judge raised concerns in a hearing today about President Donald Trump's use of a wartime authority to deport people his administration accuses of being affiliated with a Venezuelan gang, saying Trump's expanded use of the Alien Enemies Act could have \"frightening\" implications. Later Friday, Trump told reporters he didn't sign the proclamation himself , even though his name appears on the document, and downplayed his involvement.\n\n• Dismantling key agency: A day after signing an executive order to begin dismantling the Education Department , Trump announced today that the Small Business Administration will take over the department's student loan portfolio , while the Department of Health and Human Services will handle special needs and nutrition programs.\n\n• New fighter jet: Trump announced the Pentagon's decision to move forward with a new next-generation fighter jet after awarding a contract to Boeing. The announcement comes as Elon Musk met with senior officials at the Pentagon today.\n\nOur live coverage of the Trump administration has moved here.\n\nSports commentator Stephen A. Smith joined CNN on Friday and sharply condemned the Trump administration's efforts to purge diversity, equity and inclusion-related content from Pentagon websites, saying the removal of articles about sports hero Jackie Robinson and other historic service members was \"egregious\" and represented an effort to \"gloss over and scrape history.\"\n\n\"They're trying to move forward, and it's almost as if they want our nation to forget a history that involves racist behavior on the part of the White power structure that has existed in the United States of America,\" Smith said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper.\n\nSome context: The Pentagon's purge resulted in the removal of thousands of articles and images that were either completely unrelated to DEI issues, or that commemorated war heroes and historically significant service members such as Robinson, the first African American to play in Major League Baseball in the modern era. Some content was ultimately restored as the Pentagon responded to criticism of the moves.\n\nThe administration later said the removals were an inadvertent software mistake, but Smith said that defense was not good enough. \"You know what that's about. It's about plausible deniability,\" Smith told Tapper.\n\nAbout Smith: Smith rose to national fame as a sports commentator with ESPN, and has broadened his commentary to include social issues and politics in recent years. His tough-love approach to Democrats and iconoclastic media presence have propelled his name to the fringes of conversations about the 2028 presidential primary, earning him fans as some in the party weigh more unconventional paths back to the White House.\n\nSmith has stoked speculation about his intentions with a string of media comments, and by hosting several Democratic leaders on his podcast in recent weeks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday downplayed his involvement in invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1789 to deport Venezuelan migrants, saying for the first time that he hadn't signed the proclamation, even as he stood by his administration's move.\n\n\"I don't know when it was signed, because I didn't sign it,\" Trump told reporters before leaving the White House on Friday evening.\n\nThe president made his comments when asked to respond to Judge James Boasberg's criticism in court on Friday that the proclamation was \"signed in the dark\" of night.\n\n\"We want to get criminals out of our country, number one, and I don't know when it was signed because I didn't sign it,\" Trump said. \"Other people handled it, but (Secretary of State) Marco Rubio has done a great job and he wanted them out and we go along with that. We want to get criminals out of our country.\"\n\nThe proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport people who the administration accuses of being affiliated with a Venezuelan gang appears in the Federal Register with Trump's signature at the bottom.\n\nTrump raised Rubio's name without prompting from reporters. When he was then asked a hypothetical question about whether he would send another deportation flight to El Salvador tonight amid the ongoing litigation, Trump said it would be up to Rubio.\n\n\"I would say that I'd have the Secretary of State handle it, because I'm not really involved in that, but the concept of getting bad people murderers, rapists, drug dealers, all of the, these are really some bad people out of our country. I ran on that. I won on that,\" Trump said.\n\nCNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe FBI is asking the public to be on the lookout for signs of potential attacks on Tesla vehicles and facilities.\n\nAs CNN has reported , multiple facilities belonging to Elon Musk's company have been targeted in recent months by people setting fires to vehicles and vandalizing buildings. The FBI says the incidents have happened in at least nine states since the beginning of the year.\n\n\"These incidents have involved arson, gunfire, and vandalism, including graffiti expressing grievances against those the perpetrators perceive to be racists, fascists, or political opponents,\" the FBI said in its public service announcement. \"These criminal actions appear to have been conducted by lone offenders, and all known incidents occurred at night.\"\n\nThe FBI alert asked Americans to look out for violent threats related to specific Tesla properties online. It also noted unusual behavior that could be a warning sign at Tesla facilities, including people inquiring about or taking photos of security measures, or trying to access restricted areas.\n\n\"Individuals require little planning to use rudimentary tactics, such as improvised incendiary devices and firearms, and may perceive these attacks as victimless property crimes,\" the FBI said, urging anyone with information about these crimes to contact law enforcement.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its local partners have arrested nearly 400 people it claims are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua since President Donald Trump took office, including dozens in the past 48 hours, according to the agency's acting director.\n\n\"I'm proud to say in the past 48 hours, ICE, along with our local partners and our other fellow federal agencies, have arrested more than 68 TDA gang members, terrorists in the United States. To date, we've arrested 394 of these terrorists,\" Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said at a news conference in Orlando, Florida, on Friday. \"Our goal is to eradicate TDA from US soil. We will not tolerate their illegal presence or the threat they pose to the American public.\"\n\nKey context: The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants, claiming many are gang members, while at times refusing to reveal their identities or the evidence against them. Some relatives of presumed deported migrants have described a murky process that disappeared people they say have no ties to organized crime, drawing criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups.\n\nThere is an ongoing court battle over the legality of Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.\n\nCNN's Michael Williams contributed to this report.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced Friday it is reducing the staff of three offices dedicated to oversight within the department.\n\nThe department is cutting jobs at the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN.\n\nThe move comes amid continuing concerns over the Trump administration's sprawling deportation efforts , which critics say threaten to encroach on immigrants' civil liberties.\n\n\"These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS's mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operation,\" McLaughlin claimed in a statement. \"DHS remains committed to civil rights protections but must streamline oversight to remove roadblocks to enforcement. These reductions ensure taxpayer dollars support the Department's core mission: border security and immigration enforcement.\"\n\nSome context: The department's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigates public complaints of civil rights violations stemming from DHS activities and was established by the same post-9/11 law that created the Department of Homeland Security. The ombudsman offices independently review agencies within DHS, including the agency that administers immigration detention.\n\nEarlier this month, a pair of Democratic senators, describing \"troubling reports\" that the department's civil rights office would be severely reduced or eliminated, told DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in a letter that reducing the agency's civil rights division could \"jeopardize\" the ability of DHS to protect Americans' civil liberties, while listing several examples of the type of work it is involved in.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been something of a homebody since returning to office, spending weekdays at the White House and most weekends at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\n\nThis weekend, he's adding another one of his homes to the rotation: Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nFor the first time this season, Trump is visiting his New Jersey golf club, located in Somerset County, about an hour from Manhattan. He left the White House on Friday evening and is set to spend much of Saturday there before he is scheduled to attend the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia.\n\n\"We're going to Bedminster now for work - we have some work,\" Trump told reporters before boarding Marine One.\n\nThe president's out-of-town travel this year can be traced almost entirely through high-profile sporting events, including the Super Bowl in New Orleans on February 9 and NASCAR's Daytona 500 a week later .\n\nTrump, who attended the national wrestling championship in 2023, has attended several Ultimate Fighting Championship events with one of his top supporters, Dana White, who runs the organization.\n\nSince returning to power, Trump has logged significantly less travel than most presidents.\n\nHe visited North Carolina and California in January, surveying storm and fire damage, but has not traveled to any states beyond Florida since then. He is barred from running for another term, and aides say he prefers opening the White House to people from across the country over traveling.\n\nIn the first 60 days of his second term, Trump has spent at least 18 nights at home in Florida - every weekend but one, when he stayed in Washington to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference. During his four years out of office, Trump frequently ridiculed Joe Biden for spending weekends at home in Delaware.\n\nWhile Trump usually waits to visit his New Jersey Club until May, when the Mar-a-Lago season ends for the summer, he is taking an early trip this weekend. He is expected to resume visits next month to his Florida home, which he calls the \"Winter White House.\"\n\nA tense environment in the courtroom began immediately when Judge James Boasberg entered Friday's hearing on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people the government accuses of being affiliated with a Venezuelan gang.\n\nBoasberg put Department of Justice attorney Drew Ensign on the defensive within minutes, calling DOJ conduct in previous hearings and filings for the case \"intemperate and disrespectful.\"\n\nThe judge's hands were constantly moving during the hearing - between putting his glasses on to read, taking them off for inquiry emphasis, and placing his hand on his lips and chin while pondering counsel arguments.\n\nIn a few instances, he even used his hands to act out the movement of alleged Tren de Aragua members from custody to planes, and a clutched fist to reference Immigration and Customs Enforcement's custody of deportees.\n\nThroughout the hearing, the judge looked to a stapled stack of pages, from which he read quotes and cited case law. Oftentimes, while Ensign responded to questions, Boasberg avoided eye contact, instead reading from the paper.\n\nThe judge lightened up as American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt took to the podium, often puckering his lips, raising his eyebrows and nodding in agreement with a slight smirk.\n\nGelernt especially got a rise out of Boasberg with dramatic head-nodding when the attorney said the administration was \"rushing people on a plane,\" called Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act \"uncharted territory,\" and said that the government's position \"gives the president extraordinary powers.\"\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg vowed Friday to \"get to the bottom\" of whether officials in the Trump administration violated his orders temporarily blocking President Donald Trump's use of a sweeping wartime authority to deport some migrants.\n\n\"I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my order - who ordered this and what the consequences will be,\" Boasberg said near the end of a hearing over whether he should lift the pair of orders he issued last Saturday.\n\nDuring the hearing, an attorney for the migrants challenging Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act said they plan to submit new evidence that raises additional questions about the Justice Department's claim that it was not feasible to bring back some of the migrants who were on flights to El Salvador at the time of the order.\n\nA federal judge on Friday raised concerns about the policy implications of President Donald Trump's use of a sweeping wartime authority to deport people the administration accuses of being affiliated with a Venezuelan gang, calling it an \"unprecedented and expanded use\" of the 18th-century law.\n\nThe comments from US District Judge James Boasberg show his discomfort with Trump's approach to the law and signal how he might rule during a later phase of the case, when he decides whether Trump unlawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act in an effort to quickly remove some migrants. Much of Friday's hearing focused on what role courts have in curtailing an administration's interpretation of its powers under the law.\n\nThe policy implications of Trump's invocation of the law, the judge said, \"are awfully frightening.\" Under the arguments pushed by Justice Department attorneys, the judge said a president could claim \"that anybody is invading the United States,\" necessitating another use of the wartime authority.\n\nBoasberg called Trump's decision to use the measure \"an unprecedented and expanded use\" of the Alien Enemies Act that he thinks is \"a long way from the heartland of the act.\"\n\nThe hearing in DC District Court has ended. The judge has not issued a ruling on the request from the Trump administration that he wipe away his previous order blocking Alien Enemies Act-related deportations.\n\nIn remarks from the Oval Office earlier today, President Donald Trump spoke about a wide range of topics while announcing a new US fighter jet alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\nThe remarks capped a busy week for Trump, including just yesterday signing an order to begin dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nHere's a recap of some of the comments Trump made today:\n\nOn the Department of Education: Trump announced that the Small Business Administration will take up the Education Department's student loan portfolio, while the Department of Health and Human Services will lead funding efforts for special needs students.\n\nOn the Russia-Ukraine war: Trump said he believed a full ceasefire to end Russia's war in Ukraine is likely to happen \" very soon .\" The president said there was a contract being negotiated on dividing land between the two countries \"as we speak\" and that he is persistent in seeking an end to the war to stop the killing and save money on US military aid to Ukraine. He held back-to-back calls earlier this week with Russian President Vladmir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky .\n\nOn deportation efforts: Trump discarded claims today that the wrong people were sent to El Salvador after he invoked a sweeping wartime authority to target and deport migrants. Trump said he was told the migrants \"went through a very strong vetting process.\" This came just hours before Department of Justice lawyers faced the judge challenging Trump's use of the act for the deportations in a hearing. Trump intensified his attacks on the judge in a social media post this morning, after having called for his impeachment earlier this week.\n\nOn tariffs: Trump said the reciprocal tariffs announcement he's promised to make on April 2 won't be set in stone, suggesting there could be some exceptions. \"There'll be flexibility,\" he said, without elaborating on what that flexibility could look like in practice.\n\nTrump also made at least nine false claims, including a series of wildly exaggerated statistics on a variety of topics. See our fact checks of those claims here.\n\nDuring a hearing on the Trump administration's bid to revive the president's use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants, Judge James Boasberg grilled a Justice Department lawyer about the administration's response to an oral order from the judge last week.\n\nHe walked DOJ attorney Drew Ensign through a tick-tock of the proceedings in the case that were held Saturday, during which Boasberg ordered the government to immediately turn around planes that were carrying the migrants to El Salvador under President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nRemember: The administration did not turn the planes around based on the judge's oral order, and in later court filings, said it did not consider Boasberg's order binding until a written version landed on the docket later that evening.\n\n\"Did you not understand my statements in that hearing?\" Boasberg asked Ensign on Friday.\n\nEnsign confirmed that he understood Boasberg intended the order to be effective at the time he delivered it form the bench, but the DOJ attorney cited attorney-client privilege in not detailing what he had told his client agencies.\n\nBoasberg continued to grill Ensign on his lack of knowledge during Saturday's hearing about the status of the flights, and his failure to obtain more information about the flights in a recess the court took that day for him to seek those details.\n\n\"I often tell my clerks ... that the most valuable treasure they possess is their reputation and their credibility,\" Boasberg said. \"And I just ask you to make sure your team maintains that lesson.\"\n\nJudge James Boasberg kicked off a hearing on the Trump administration's bid to revive the president's use of a wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants by criticizing the tone the administration had taken in some of its filings.\n\nBoasberg, who is the chief judge of the US district court in Washington, DC, told DOJ attorney Drew Ensign that the government had used \"intemperate and disrespectful\" language that he's \"never seen from the United States.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump defended steps he's taken to target top law firms who've clashed with him and his administration in the past, telling reporters on Friday that the firms are \"not babies\" but very \"sophisticated people.\"\n\n\"The law firms all want to make deals - you mean the law firms that we're going after, that went after me for four years, ruthlessly, violently, illegally?\" Trump claimed during Oval Office remarks when asked if his executive orders singling out firms that have represented his perceived enemies amounted to coercion. \"Are those the law firms you're talking about? They're not babies. They're very sophisticated people. Those law firms did bad things, bad things.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the president announced that he was rescinding an executive order that suspended security clearances for lawyers and staff at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison after the New York-based firm agreed to dedicate the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of Trump's term \"to support the Administration's initiatives,\" according to the president.\n\nThe deal comes as the Trump administration cracks down on top law firms. Trump had signed the executive order targeting Paul Weiss a little over a week after he targeted the large firms Covington & Burling and Perkins Coie.\n\nCNN's Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed reporting to this post.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday said the reciprocal tariffs announcement he's promised to make on April 2 won't be set in stone, suggesting there could be some exceptions.\n\n\"The word flexibility is an important word,\" Trump told reporters, speaking at the Oval Office. \"There'll be flexibility,\" he added on the reciprocal tariffs. Trump didn't elaborate on what that flexibility could look like in practice.\n\nHowever, he cited previous pleas from the big three US automakers for an exemption to the 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian goods set to go into effect earlier this month. Initially, Trump responded by announcing cars and car parts would be exempt from 25% tariffs, granted they comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada trade deal.\n\n\"I gave the American car companies a break because it would have been unfair if I didn't,\" Trump said. He later announced he'd give all products coming from Mexico and Canada the same treatment through April 2 if they comply with USMCA as well.\n\nThe Small Business Administration is cutting around 43% of its workforce, or about 2,700 positions, the agency's chief Kelly Loeffler announced Friday.\n\nThe move comes amid the Trump administration's cuts to the federal workforce across agencies led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. It will be done via reductions, expiration of pandemic and term appointments, and voluntary resignations, according to SBA's press release.\n\nThe agency said its core services wouldn't be impacted - including its loan guarantee and disaster assistance programs, and its field and veteran operations.\n\nIn a video posted to X, Loeffler vowed to refocus SBA's mission to empower job creators and end fiscal mismanagement that she attributed to the work of the prior administration.\n\nAlong with the cuts, President Donald Trump announced from the Oval Office today that SBA will take on student loans from the Department of Education as part of the administration's efforts to dismantle the department.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, speaking from the Oval Office Friday, said he believed a full ceasefire to end the war between Russia and Ukraine is likely to happen \"very soon.\"\n\n\"We are going to have a full ceasefire very soon in the Russia-Ukraine war,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president said there was a contract being negotiated on dividing land between the two countries \"as we speak.\"\n\n\"We're going to have a contract, and the contract is being negotiated,\" Trump said. \"The contract in terms of dividing up the lands, etcetera, etcetera, it's being negotiated as we speak.\"\n\nTrump, who recently held separate phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky about implementing a partial ceasefire, said he is persistent in seeking an end to the war to stop the killings and save the US the money being spent on military aid to Ukraine.\n\nPresident Donald Trump swatted down the idea Friday that annexing Canada as the nation's 51st state, as he's repeatedly suggested, might cause an influx of Democratic voters, telling reporters he's more focused on adding Canada's \"beautiful landmass\" to the United States.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump blasted Canada's Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, telling Fox News in an interview the politician \"is, stupidly, no friend of mine.\"\n\n\"I don't know, but [Poilievre] said negative things,\" Trump told Fox News' Laura Ingraham Tuesday. \"I think it's easier to deal actually, with a liberal, and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care.\"\n\nBut on Friday, he suggested there might be an untapped conservative majority in Canada.\n\n\"Just a little while ago, before I got involved and totally changed the election ... the conservative was leading against, I call him Governor Trudeau,\" Trump claimed. \"So, you know, so I don't know about that. I think Canada is a place, like a lot of other places, if you have a good candidate, the candidate's gonna win.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service has cut more forecast-critical weather balloon launches at eight sites in the United States due to staffing shortages brought on by the Trump administration's effort to slash government employees and expenses .\n\nThe cuts will result in reduced forecast accuracy, not just for NWS forecasts but for all the private industry forecasts that rely on the agency's data. Weather balloon launches are the backbone of global weather forecasts. Launched twice a day, they feed weather forecast models with twice-daily weather observations and provide the real-life starting point for those mathematical models to predict the future.\n\nAll launches have been suspended in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota. They have been reduced to once a day at six other locations in Nebraska, South Dakota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Michigan and Wyoming.\n\nWorkforce cuts: Hundreds of specialists were laid off from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration earlier this month, including NWS meteorologists and other experts. The agency is looking to fire or put on leave another 1,000 employees, CNN previously reported.\n\nExperts in weather, climate and oceans told CNN the layoffs are a huge loss of knowledge and expertise that puts Americans more at risk of extreme weather.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Friday that the Air Force's newest fighter jet , announced from the Oval Office on Friday afternoon, will provide the US \"generations in the future of air dominance.\"\n\n\"We've had the F-15, we have had the F-16, the F-18, the F-22, the F-35 - now we have the F-47, which sends a very direct, clear message to our allies that we're not going anywhere, and to our enemies, that we will be able to project power around the globe unimpeded for generations to come,\" Hegseth said while standing next to President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump announced on Friday a contract was being awarded to Boeing to build the Air Force's newest fighter aircraft, called the Next Generation Air Dominance Platform, or F-47. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said in the Oval Office on Friday that the aircraft is the \"crown jewel in the next generation air dominance family of systems,\" which will help \"write the next generation of modern aerial warfare.\"\n\nThe F-47 will be the world's first 6th-generation fighter, Allvin said in an additional statement released Friday by the Air Force, and will have \"significantly longer ranger, more advanced stealth, be more sustainable, supportable, and have a higher availability\" than 5th generation fighter aircraft.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pushed back against reports Friday that DOGE head and Tesla CEO Elon Musk was going to be briefed at the Pentagon on the US military's top-secret plan for potential war that might break out with China, telling reporters, \"I don't want other people seeing-anybody seeing potential war with China.\"\n\n\"I don't want to show it to anybody. You know you're talking about a potential war with China,\" Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office. \"We don't want to have a potential war with China, but I can tell you, if we did, we're very well equipped to handle it.\"\n\nMusk met with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon earlier today, though neither Musk nor Hegseth answered questions from reporters on if China was discussed. Hegseth was also on hand in the Oval Office event later Friday. When asked about the meeting at the White House, Hegseth characterized it as \"fantastic.\" He didn't elaborate on what the two discussed.\n\nRemember: CNN has reported that Musk has a top-secret security clearance, and is serving in the Trump administration as a special government employee. However, even individuals with adequate security clearances still require a 'need to know' before accessing particular information, according to the US government's classified handling procedures.\n\nTrump acknowledged Friday that Musk also has his own business interests in China, which could pose a conflict of interest if he was briefed on a potential war plan with the nation.\n\n\"I don't want to show that to anybody- but certainly, you wouldn't show it to a businessman who is helping us so much,\" Trump said. \"You know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that- but it was such a fake story.\"\n\nCNN's Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting to this post. This post has been updates with Hegseth's comments on the meeting.\n\nPresident Donald Trump discarded claims Friday that the wrong people were sent to El Salvador after he invoked a sweeping wartime authority to target and deport hundreds of migrants under the Alien Enemies Act last week.\n\n\"Well, I was told that they went through a very strong vetting process, and that will also be continuing in El Salvador,\" Trump said from the Oval Office on Friday after being asked if the migrants deported did not all belong to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\n\"And if there is anything like that, we would certainly want to find out,\" Trump said, \"we don't want to make that kind of mistake,\" he added.\n\nSome background: The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants while refusing to reveal their identities or the evidence against them, prompting complaints from the migrants' families and critics who say the administration is trampling on civil liberties, as CNN has reported.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters Friday he'd ordered the full release of files related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy earlier this week, defending the decision to include even unredacted Social Security numbers in the massive document dump.\n\n\"I was given the task of releasing that, because many presidents have gone through it and they haven't released, and I said, 'Release,'- we even released Social Security numbers,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I didn't want anything deleted. They said, 'Sir, what about Social Security?' Of people long gone, but they're long gone, so I can't imagine ...if you do delete it, we have people going to say, 'Why did you delete it? There's something in there.' So, we gave Social Security, we gave everything.\"\n\nThis week's documents were posted to the website of the National Archives Tuesday evening. It may take some time before researchers who have studied the JFK assassination can go through the more than 2,000 newly posted documents, which were identified only by record numbers with no descriptions.\n\nBut in remarks Friday, Trump acknowledged that there were unlikely to be any bombshells in the new release.\n\n\"I mean, you know, we have nothing- we really have nothing to hide,\" Trump said. \"We shouldn't have, you know, when a lot of time goes by, but with the Kennedy files in particular, they were going crazy on them. I don't think there's anything that's earth-shattering, but you'll have to make that determination.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the Pentagon's decision to move forward with a next-generation fighter jet titled F-47 on Friday in joint remarks alongside Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth from the Oval Office.\n\n\"At my direction, the United States Air Force is moving forward with the world's first sixth-generation fighter jet, number six, sixth generation, nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it'll be known as the F-47,\" Trump said.\n\nThe president went on to say an experimental version of the F-47 has been flying for almost five years.\n\n\"It's something the likes of which nobody has seen before,\" he said, \"and this has been in the works for a long period of time.\"\n\nBoeing will spearhead the development of the F-47 Air Force's fighter, following a \"rigorous\" competition between the uppermost aerospace companies.\n\n\"After a rigorous and thorough competition between some of America's top aerospace companies, the Air Force is going to be awarding the contract for the next generation air dominance platform to Boeing,\" Trump announced.\n\nMore on the jet: Late-last year, the Air Force paused the decision on how to proceed with the sixth-generation fighter. The Air Force said in December that then-Secretary Frank Kendall would defer the decision to the Trump administration.\n\nThe Next Generation Air Dominance program (NGAD) is intended to produce the US military's sixth-generation fighter jet, newer and more advanced than the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lighting II, which has suffered from major cost overruns and delays.\n\nElon Musk has railed against the F-35, instead advocating for unmanned drone swarms as a cheaper, more effective weapon. On social media in November, Musk said \"Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.\"\n\nWhen Lockheed Martin was awarded the F-35 in October 2001, the weapons maker said the program would cost approximately $200 billion. The company's CEO promised the F-35 would be \"capable and affordable\" and be produced \"on schedule and cost.\" More than two decades later, the total cost of the program has exceeded $2 trillion , according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), as the military services \"plan to use it less.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Friday - just hours after signing an executive order beginning the process of dismantling the Department of Education - that the Small Business Administration will take up the department's student loan portfolio, while the Department of Health and Human Services will lead funding efforts for special needs students.\n\n\"I've decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, a terrific person, will handle all of the student loan portfolio,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Friday. \"We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans, tens of thousands of loans, pretty complicated deal, and that's coming out of the Department of Education immediately, and it's going to be headed up by Kelly Loeffler, SBA, in the role set for it.\"\n\nThe announcement comes as CNN has reported that Education has struggled to find a viable alternative agency to manage its massive student debt portfolio, according to two sources involved in the discussions. The loan portfolio totals a staggering $1.8 trillion in debt, with an estimated 40% of loans past due, the sources said, up from what CNN has previously reported based on publicly available information.\n\nSpecial needs funding for students will be overseen by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump said, who will be tasked with \"handling special needs and all of the nutrition programs and everything else.\"\n\n\"Rather complex, but that's going to be headed by and handled by Health and Human Services, so I think that'll work out very well,\" he added.\n\nWhile entirely shuttering the Department of Education requires an act of Congress, Thursday's order directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin the process.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is delivering remarks alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office.\n\nThe White House did not specify the focus of their remarks, but we will provide updates as they become available.\n\nElon Musk's meetings at the Pentagon have now wrapped. He exited Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's office in the Pentagon at 10:21 a.m. ET this morning after arriving at the building at 9 a.m. ET for meetings with senior Pentagon leadership.\n\nAsked by CNN how the meeting went, Musk responded, \"It's always a great meeting.\" He then commented, \"I've been here before you know,\" as he and Hegseth laughed and walked down the stairs to the building's entrance.\n\nOutside the Pentagon, Musk and Hegseth shook hands as the tech billionaire told him, \"If there's anything I can do to be helpful, I'd like to see you.\" He told Hegseth that he'd \"really like us to have a good outcome here.\"\n\nThe meeting comes as the New York Times reported Thursday that Musk will be briefed on the US military's plan for any war that might break out with China. President Donald Trump in a late night Truth Social post dismissed the report, saying that \"China will not even be mentioned or discussed.\"\n\nNeither Hegseth nor Musk answered shouted questions about whether they discussed China in their meeting or if it was a classified briefing.  Asked by the New York Times after Musk's departure what the two discussed, Hegseth said, \"Why would I tell you?\" And walked inside.\n\nMultiple versions of US military war plans are often prepared at varying levels of classification, according to people familiar.\n\nAt the highest level, military operational plans contain so-called \"code word\" clearance information that involves sensitive sources and methods such as the use of human and technical assets. Less sensitive versions of briefings are also frequently prepared that do not include highly classified information. It is unclear which version will be presented to Musk.\n\nThis post has been updated with more details on Musk's meetings at the Pentagon.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Friday morning told a federal judge that the Trump administration is holding Cabinet-level discussions on whether to invoke the state secrets privilege in response to demands it release more information on last weekend's deportation flights.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg chastised the Justice Department yesterday, saying it did not obey his order that it turn over information he's seeking about deportations the Trump administration carried out last weekend, saying it \"evaded its obligations.\"\n\nBoasberg had ordered the administration to turn over the information by noon ET Thursday or invoke the \"state-secrets privilege\" in its bid to avoiding provide the information. But in a brief order Thursday afternoon, the judge said the department had instead submitted a sealed filing \"shortly after\" the deadline.\n\nThe DOJ filing, Boasberg wrote, included a sworn statement from an official with the ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations who \"repeated the same general information about the flights\" and went on to say that Cabinet secretaries are \"'are currently actively considering whether to invoke the state secrets privilege over the other facts requested by the Court's order.'\"\n\n\"This is woefully insufficient,\" Boasberg wrote. \"The Government cannot proffer a regional ICE official to attest to Cabinet-level discussions of the state-secrets privilege; indeed, his declaration on that point, not surprisingly, is based solely on his unsubstantiated 'understand[ing].'\"\n\nHappening today: Boasberg is holding a hearing this afternoon on the Trump administration's attempt to lift his order barring deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's effort to begin dismantling the Department of Education is raising new questions for the country's millions of public schools, student-loan holders and parents.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will happen to the agency's programs and functions, and legal challenges to Trump's executive order are likely.\n\nRead up here on what to know about Trump's move to dismantle the agency and its possible impacts, and watch CNN's Kaitlan Collins' reporting on the executive order below:\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order to begin dismantling the US Department of Education, seeking to fulfill decades of conservative ambition to get rid of the agency but raising new questions for public schools and parents. Kaitlan Collins reports. #CNN #News\n\nA top Pentagon spokesperson has been reassigned to another role inside the department following criticism over how he responded to reports that the Department of Defense removed an article about Jackie Robinson, the Black sports icon who served in the US military during World War II.\n\nIt is not clear what new role the now-former spokesperson, John Ullyot, will move into. But he was sidelined after issuing multiple different statements on Wednesday, apparently without senior leadership approval, attempting to explain away the Robinson fiasco as an example of how diversity equity and inclusion programs are \"dead\" at the Department of Defense, defense officials told CNN on Thursday. CNN has reached out to Ullyot for comment.\n\nA person close to Ullyot told CNN, \"John looks forward to working with Secretary Hegseth on special projects - a move they both welcome.\"\n\nHis reassignment is emblematic of how the Defense Department has struggled to both message and execute Hegseth's directive in February to purge all \"DEI\"-related content from Pentagon websites and social media.\n\nRelated article Military was instructed to search keywords including 'first' and 'history' during rushed purge of Pentagon websites\n\nThe Pentagon has had to issue numerous statements cleaning up the mess, including one on Thursday by the department's chief Pentagon spokesperson who acknowledged that \"some important content was incorrectly pulled offline to be reviewed.\"\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information.\n\nUS Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Friday that the administration is \"very hopeful\" that the price of eggs will continue to go down with the importation of eggs from Turkey, South Korea and other countries.\n\n\"We are very hopeful,\" Rollins told Fox Business on Friday.\n\n\"Not only the importation of eggs from Turkey and South Korea for the short term, we're also talking to other countries,\" Rollins said. \"I was on a couple phone calls yesterday to potentially bring in some other eggs imported for the short term to help bring those costs down,\" she added.\n\nRollins also said that a long-term plan included preventing the spread of avian flu among poultry by \"repopulating the cold birds\" saying, \"We are investing in biosecurity to lock the barns down, which is proven to be the most important solution to keeping the avian bird flu out.\"\n\nSome context: CNN reported earlier this week that for the third straight week, wholesale egg prices fell to $4.15 per dozen, according to the US Department of Agriculture, a 30% decrease from the week before when prices were $6.85 a dozen. However, the average price for consumers is $5.90 per dozen eggs, up $0.94 from last month, according to the USDA.\n\nAhead of this afternoon's hearing with US District Judge James Boasberg , President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the judge, after having called for his impeachment earlier this week over how Boasberg handled a challenge to the president's use of a sweeping wartime power to swiftly deport certain noncitizens.\n\n\"No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" the president's Truth Social post read.\n\nMore about today's hearing: The upcoming hearing on Friday at 2:30 p.m. ET comes as the district judge faces a high-profile confrontation with the administration over his orders from last weekend, which temporarily halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe judge is also investigating whether the administration ignored those orders with deportation flights that took place Saturday night.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will be speaking at the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at 11 a.m. ET. today.\n\nYesterday, Trump signed two executive orders: one to begin dismantling the Education Department , while the other was aimed at increasing US production of critical minerals by invoking the Defense Production Act.\n\nCatch up on the yesterday's headlines as you start your Friday:\n\nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment Friday on a report that Elon Musk would be briefed on the US military's top-secret plan for any potential future war with the Asian country.\n\nThe New York Times reported earlier Thursday that the tech billionaire and special US government employee will be briefed on such a plan.\n\n\"I'm not aware of what you just mentioned,\" ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in response to a question on the topic during a regular news briefing Friday.\n\nMusk will visit the Pentagon on Friday at the invitation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Defense Department said late Thursday in a statement to CNN.\n\nPresident Donald Trump in a late-night Truth Social post dismissed the New York Times report, saying: \"China will not even be mentioned or discussed.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that appears to empower the Department of Government Efficiency to gain \"full and prompt access\" to unclassified federal agency records, data, software systems and information technology systems.\n\nWhile DOGE is not explicitly mentioned in the order, it directs the heads of government agencies to ensure that \"federal officials designated by the President,\" agency heads or their designees have full access to these records \"for purposes of pursuing Administration priorities related to the identification and elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse.\"\n\nThis includes facilitating and authorizing information sharing and consolidation between and among agencies. Agencies are given a 30-day deadline to rescind or modify all guidance that would make that harder.\n\nWhile the order is limited to unclassified data, agency heads are directed to review classified information policies and submit their recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget on whether the classifications should be eliminated or modified to \"to achieve the goals set forth\" in the order.\n\nAgency heads are also directed to ensure the federal government will be given \"unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding.\"\n\nThis comes as DOGE continues to seek access to federal systems and sensitive government agency data.\n\nEarlier Thursday , a federal judge blocked the Social Security Administration from giving DOGE access to sensitive agency data, including data containing individuals' personally identifiable information, accusing them of going on a \"fishing expedition.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

But in an apparent reference to his own presidency, Trump said the aircraft would be known as the F-47. Aircraft designations are normally announced by the Air Force.\n\n\"It's something the likes of which nobody has seen before,\" Trump said, \"and this has been in the works for a long period of time.\"\n\nTrump also promised the F-47 would be able to cooperate with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are a major focus of the military, especially as the US has watched Ukraine and Russia effectively use drones in relatively inexpensive long-range attacks and employed drone swarms to overwhelm aerial defenses.\n\n\"This plane flies with drones. It flies with many, many drones, as many as you want,\" Trump said. \"It's a technology that's new, but it doesn't fly by itself. It flies with many drones, as many as you want, and that's something that no other plane can do.\"\n\nIt was the Air Force's decision to award the F-47 program to Boeing, but Trump's celebration of the announcement was somewhat of a surprise, since he has repeatedly criticized the company.\n\nTrump has railed against Boeing for the cost overruns and delays with the next Air Force One. \"We are getting a new Air Force One, if Boeing could ever finish the damn thing,\" Trump said in February. Boeing's leadership said they would try to move the delivery schedule up, but there's \"no silver bullet\" for the program.\n\nAnother major Boeing program for the Air Force - the KC-46 tanker - is projected to be more than seven years behind its original timeline for reaching full-rate production, according to the Government Accountability Office, a far cry from the Trump administration's goal of producing systems faster and more efficiently.\n\nFor decades, Boeing produced the backbone of the US bomber fleet, from B-17s and B-29s in World War II to B-52s that rolled off the assembly line in the 1960s and are still flying today. Boeing now produces the F-15EX Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet, two major platforms for the Air Force and the Navy, respectively. These fighter aircraft are derivatives of designs initially developed by McDonnell Douglas, an aircraft manufacturer that merged with Boeing in 1997.\n\nThe last production fighter designed and built exclusively by Boeing is the P-26 Peashooter, which first flew in 1932. Boeing also designed and built the X-32 Joint Strike Fighter, which ultimately lost out to the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.\n\nLate-last year, the Air Force paused the decision on how to proceed with the sixth-generation fighter.

      "text": "March 9, 2025: Donald Trump presidency news\n\n• Trump's tariffs: President Donald Trump sought to downplay the impact his back-and-forth trade announcements have had on financial markets , saying in a Fox News interview that the tariffs he has imposed and then adjusted on Mexico and Canada are part of his long-term strategy and \"could go up\" in the future . And as trade tensions have led to worries that a recession could be looming, Trump would not predict whether the United States will experience one in 2025.\n\n• Spending fight looms: Trump is urging Republicans to remain unified and pass a stopgap government funding proposal ahead of a Friday deadline, buying time to craft a more significant bill that advances his agenda. Democrats have slammed the spending plan and indicated the GOP may have to go it alone.\n\n• Saudi Arabia talks: Top Trump administration officials will meet separately with Russian and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia this week, a source familiar with the plans said, setting up another critical week of high-stakes talks as Trump and his team seek to strike a deal between the two countries.\n\nOur live coverage of the Trump administration's transition has ended for the day. Follow the latest updates or read through the posts below.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown \"could happen\" but claimed it would be Democrats' fault, while also telling reporters he believes the proposed government funding stopgap bill will ultimately pass.\n\n\"The Democrats want that. They want to destroy the country. So, I can't tell you, but it could happen. It shouldn't have happened, and it probably won't,\" Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, said about a potential government shutdown. \"I think the CR is going to get passed. We'll see. But it could happen, you never know.\"\n\nThe Republican-led House is expected to vote on the Trump-endorsed continuing resolution on Tuesday, as government funding dries up at the end of the week.\n\nThe measure funds the government through September 30 and is intended to buy time for Trump and GOP leaders to steer key pieces of the president's agenda through Congress this summer.\n\n\"The House and Senate have put together, under the circumstances, a very good funding Bill (\"CR\")! All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,\" Trump posted on Truth Social over the weekend.\n\nTop Trump administration officials will meet separately with Russian and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia this week, a source familiar with the plans said, setting up another critical week of high-stakes talks as President Donald Trump and his team seek to strike a deal between the two countries.\n\nThe source declined to say who would be present for the talks.\n\nTrump previewed the upcoming talks, telling reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, \"Big meetings coming up, as you know, in Saudi Arabia. That's going to include Russia, but Ukraine, we'll see if we can get something done.\"\n\nTrump expressed hope that \"some very big things could happen this week.\"\n\nTalks in Jeddah: The US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia come as the two countries work to put their relationship back on solid footing following last month's Oval Office blowup between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Since the meeting - in which Trump and Vance berated Zelensky over the war, and the Ukrainian leader pushed back on several points - top US officials have been working to right ties.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio is among the US officials scheduled to meet with Ukrainian counterparts in Jeddah.\n\nMark Carney, the newly elected leader of Canada's Liberal Party and soon-to-be prime minister, said Sunday that his government would keep retaliatory tariffs on the US \"until the Americans show us respect.\"\n\nSlamming the Trump administration's tariff plans, Carney struck a defiant tone and said of the US president, \"He's attacking Canadian families, workers, and businesses and we cannot let him succeed and we won't.\"\n\n\"In trade as in hockey, Canada will win,\" Carney, Justin Trudeau's successor, said of the brewing trade war with the US.\n\nSome context: Trump has repeatedly blamed Canada for illegal immigration into the US, threatened to turn Canada into a 51st state, and announced steep tariffs on Canadian imports, which the White House says is necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl over its borders.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday praised Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whom he appointed to the Supreme Court during his first term, as she faces backlash for voting against his attempt to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.\n\n\"She's a very good woman. She's very smart, and I don't know about people attacking her. I really don't know. I think she's a very good woman,\" Trump said aboard Air Force One on Sunday night.\n\nSome background: Barrett received a slew of online criticism, including from Trump allies, from being called a \"rattled law professor with her head up her a**\" to a \"DEI hire,\" after her vote on Wednesday.\n\nBarrett, a former appeals court judge and law professor, joined Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's three liberals in upholding - for now - a lower court ruling that required the administration to quickly spend the contested aid.\n\nPresident Donald Trump expressed uncertainty on Sunday about a potential recession, telling reporters aboard Air Force One, \"Who knows?\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump claimed the United States will become \"so rich\" from the tariffs he's imposing on other nations.\n\nTrump was asked about his comment in a Fox News interview that aired earlier Sunday in which he declined to predict whether the country would face a recession this year.\n\n\"Of course, you hesitate. Who knows? All I know is this: We're going to take in hundreds of millions of dollars in tariffs, and we're going to become so rich you're not going to know where to spend all that money,\" the president said.\n\nSome context: As CNN has reported, the cost of tariffs is typically passed to the consumer by way of higher prices, and American consumers and businesses stand to pay a hefty price for the tariffs Trump enacted on Mexico, Canada and China, the nation's top three trading partners.\n\nPresident Donald Trump predicted Sunday that \"very big things\" would emerge from talks this week between senior US and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia, saying a pause on sharing intelligence with Kyiv was all but lifted while still stopping short of promising to lift a pause on military aid if Ukraine signs a minerals deal with the US.\n\nTrump said Ukraine needed to demonstrate a desire to reach peace in order for the US assistance to resume flowing.\n\n\"I think they will sign the minerals deal. But ... I want them to want peace,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington from a weekend at his South Florida estate.\n\n\"Right now they haven't shown it to the extent that they should ... but I think they will be, and I think it's going to become evident over the next two or three days,\" the president said.\n\nTrump did not offer specifics on what a commitment to peace might look like that would cause him to reinstate US aid.\n\nBut asked whether he was considering restarting the sharing of intelligence with Kyiv, he was more conciliatory. \"We just about have,\" he said.\n\nTrump said he expected significant results to emerge from this week's meetings in Jeddah, where his secretary of state, national security adviser and special envoy will meet Ukrainian officials to attempt a reset in ties after the February 28 argument in the Oval Office between Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodomyr Zelensky.\n\n\"I think we're going to have a good result in Saudi Arabia. ... And I think Ukraine's going to do well, and I think Russia is going to do - I think some very big things could happen this week. I hope so,\" Trump said.\n\nIn some of his last remarks as Canada's Liberal Party leader, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Sunday that Canadians face an \"existential challenge\" from the US.\n\n\"This is a nation-defining moment,\" he told the Liberal Party's leadership convention in Ottawa.\n\n\"And now, as Canadians face from our neighbor an existential challenge, an economic crisis, Canadians are showing exactly what we are made of,\" Trudeau said in reference to US President Donald Trump's ramped-up tariff threats and calls to make Canada the 51st state.\n\n\"The world is looking to see what Canadians will do,\" said Trudeau, who will remain as Canada's prime minister for a transitional period while his successor, Mark Carney, settles in.\n\nSome context: Trump said Sunday that tariffs on some Canadian goods \"could go up,\" punctuating the recently tumultuous trade relationship between the US and Canada.\n\nTrump announced 25% tariffs on most Canadian imports in February, but, after a brief rollout earlier this week, he postponed the tariffs for a month .\n\nFor his part, Trudeau announced a 25% retaliatory tariff on $155 billion of US goods on Tuesday, and Trump has threatened to initiate new tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed Sunday that President Donald Trump's promised 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports will go into effect as planned Wednesday, but indicated tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber products will wait until April 2.\n\nThat appears to mark yet another turn in Trump's back-and-forth trade announcements of the past week: When the president first announced the dairy and lumber tariffs Friday, he said they could be imposed as soon as that evening, \"or we'll wait until Monday or Tuesday.\"\n\nBut when questioned specifically on the dairy and lumber measures on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Lutnick suggested the timeline has been extended.\n\n\"Canada is supposed to have a free trade agreement with us; 250% on dairy products - it's outrageous. And you know the president's going to respond to it. But he's agreed not to respond until April 2,\" Lutnick told NBC's Kristin Welker.\n\nApril 2 is also the date Trump set for lifting a pause on tariffs for many other goods from Canada and Mexico.\n\nPain for consumers: The commerce secretary and top Trump adviser acknowledged that American consumers may see prices go up on \"some products\" as a result of the president's trade policy.\n\n\"Foreign goods may get a little more expensive. But American goods are going to get cheaper, and you're going to be helping Americans by buying American,\" Lutnick said.\n\nThe CEOs of Target and Best Buy have warned prices could increase quickly.\n\nLutnick also emphatically stated there is \"no chance\" of a recession.\n\n\"There's going to be no recession in America,\" he said.\n\nCellphone video captured Vice President JD Vance being approached by a group of pro-Ukrainian protesters while out in Cincinnati, Ohio, with his 3-year-old daughter on Saturday.\n\nVance can be seen engaging with the group, who voiced concern about the Trump administration's shift in US policy toward Ukraine . Protesters interjected at times with questions and responses, arguing against the vice president's statements as he spoke.\n\nVance later wrote on social media that while it was a \"mostly respectful conversation,\" some of the protesters had \"followed us around and shouted as my daughter grew increasingly anxious and scared\" before he stopped to talk to the group. Vance said he engaged with the protesters \"in the hopes that I could trade a few minutes of conversation for them leaving my toddler alone.\"\n\nAnn Hall, one of the protesters, told CNN that Vance's post was not a fair representation of the incident.\n\nWatch parts of the interaction below:\n\nCell phone video captured Vice President JD Vance being approached by pro-Ukrainian protesters in Cincinnati, Ohio while out with his three-year-old daughter. One of the protesters told CNN they were \"extremely upset\" with Vance's subsequent post on X about the encounter. #cnn #news #ukraine #russia #vpjdvance #cincinnati #ohio\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham says he's \"worried about\" the Trump administration's decision to pause military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine .\n\n\"As long as the fighting is going on, if we pull the plug on Ukraine, it would be worse than Afghanistan. I don't think President Trump has any desire to do that,\" Graham said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n\"But until we have a ceasefire, I would give Ukraine what they need, and in terms of intelligence and weapons to defend themselves.\"\n\nGraham said he talked to national security adviser Mike Waltz \"a couple of days ago,\" and that the US goal is to \"end the war honorably and justly,\" adding that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"blew it\" in his recent tense Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky over a perceived lack of gratitude for US support, with Zelensky pushing back at several points.\n\nUpcoming talks: Graham said he thinks US negotiators, who are attending talks with Ukrainian counterparts in Saudi Arabia starting Monday, will find out this week \"what a good deal looks like\" to Kyiv officials.\n\nThen they can \"urge the Russians to sit down with the White House and compare notes and end this war,\" the South Carolina lawmaker said.\n\nGraham added that he plans to introduce a bill to sanction Russia's banking and energy sectors in the coming days to push the country to \"get to the table\" in negotiations to end the war.\n\nIn interviews Sunday, some Democratic lawmakers criticized fellow party members' behavior during President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress last week, once again highlighting a divide in the caucus over how they should have responded to the moment.\n\nDivergent tactics were on full display from the party during last Tuesday's speech, with some Democrats holding signs, walking out or boycotting it altogether. Most prominently, Rep. Al Green was removed from the chamber after standing up and shouting during the opening minutes of the speech, prompting a GOP-led censure that was joined by 10 Democrats .\n\nOther party members took a more muted approach, following the guidance of House Democratic leadership, who had urged lawmakers not to mount high-profile protests and to show restraint during the address, warning the GOP could seize on any outbursts.\n\nHere's what some Democrats said about the issue Sunday:\n\nCNN's Veronica Stracqualursi, Sarah Ferris and Annie Grayer contributed reporting to this post.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey said Sunday that a bipartisan short-term government funding bill is the best path to averting a shutdown this week, highlighting the challenges congressional Republicans potentially face in advancing a plan without Democratic votes.\n\n\"Republicans are in charge of this process right now,\" Kim told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nKim accused House Speaker Mike Johnson, whose GOP leadership team unveiled a Trump-backed stopgap bill on Saturday, of walking away from \"ongoing\" bipartisan talks.\n\nThe senator said he would prefer to vote for a bill that extends current funding levels for 30 days, so bipartisan negotiations could continue over a longer-term plan, instead of Johnson's plan to \"kick the can down the road\" to the end of the fiscal year.\n\nPressed by Tapper on whether he would vote against the House GOP plan, which also includes $6 billion for defense spending and $13 billion in cuts to domestic spending, if it comes to the Senate floor, Kim said, \"That's not what I'm saying,\" adding, \"We need to see what happens in the House.\"\n\nKim speculated that Johnson may not be able to secure the GOP votes needed to pass a bill with his narrow majority , saying the speaker is \"very bad at keeping his caucus together.\"\n\nSenate spending negotiators have been working in recent weeks on a shorter-term bipartisan funding bill, though appropriations legislation must ultimately be launched in the House, where Democratic leaders have already thrown cold water on Johnson's plan, signaling he can't afford to lose virtually any Republican votes.\n\nKey GOP lawmaker weighs in: The Republican co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that he remains undecided and is still \"digging through\" the measure.\n\nFitzpatrick said ideally he would have liked to see a bipartisan bill that did not have such a thin margin for success in funding the government.\n\nCNN's Aileen Graef contributed reporting to this post.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio chastised his Polish counterpart for \"making things up\" after the official accused President Donald Trump's ally Elon Musk of threatening to cut off Ukraine's access to Starlink internet.\n\nThe dispute stemmed from an argument between Musk and an X user over whether the SpaceX CEO was sufficiently critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago.\n\nMusk replied that his Starlink system is the \"backbone of the Ukrainian army\" and warned its \"entire front line\" would collapse if he turned off the system. Musk also contended that Ukraine \"will inevitably lose\" the war with Russia, urging an immediate end to the conflict.\n\nPolish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski responded to Musk, saying the Polish government pays $50 million per year to provide Starlink connectivity to Ukraine, and \"the ethics of threatening the victim of aggression apart, if SpaceX proves to be an unreliable provider we will be forced to look for other suppliers.\"\n\nRubio pushed back , saying the Polish official was \"just making things up\" and that \"no one has made any threats about cutting Ukraine off from Starlink.\"\n\n\"Say thank you because without Starlink, Ukraine would have lost this war long ago and Russians would be on the border with Poland right now,\" he added.\n\nSome context: The exchange comes as Rubio is scheduled to meet his Ukranian counterparts this week in Saudi Arabia, where the two countries are looking to move forward from a tense Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIt also comes on the heels of a New York Times report that Rubio and Musk clashed during a recent Cabinet meeting , which Trump has denied.\n\nSen. Elissa Slotkin said Sunday that she's not opposed to using tariffs to bring back American manufacturing, but President Donald Trump has taken a \"reckless\" approach.\n\nThe Michigan lawmaker, who Democrats tapped to deliver their party's response to Trump's address to Congress , warned in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that a trade war sparked by tariffs would be a \"gift to foreign automakers.\"\n\n\"Most of us aren't against tariffs, full stop,\" Slotkin said, calling the trade policy \"an important tool in the toolkit.\"\n\nTrump on Thursday signed executive actions that delay 25% tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada for nearly one month, after the initial policy spurred threats of reciprocal tariffs by those countries and fear among US consumers.\n\nSlotkin said the way Trump is handling tariffs is \"the way he's handling everything else right now,\" warning against \"reckless change\" versus \"responsible change.\"\n\n\"The way that he's on again, off again, you know, pounding Canada as if they're the exact same thing as China. It just creates this chaotic feeling,\" she told NBC, adding that she's not against sanctions on China \"in principle,\" while Canada is a top foreign market for Michigan farmers.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Sunday announced new leadership at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with Todd Lyons serving as acting director and Madison Sheahan as deputy director.\n\n\"With President Trump's support, I am appointing new ICE leadership to deliver results that President Trump and the American people rightfully demand,\" Noem said in a statement Sunday.\n\n\"Todd Lyons and Madison Sheahan are work horses, strong executors, and accountable leaders who will lead the men and women of ICE to achieve the American people's mandate to target, arrest and deport illegal aliens.\"\n\nLyons previously held positions as the executive associate director and the assistant director of field operations for ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations. Sheahan serves as the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.\n\n\"Adding more people to the team with Todd and with Madison is going to allow us to partner with local law enforcement officials to make sure that we truly are following through on enforcing the law, and if you break our law, then there's going to be consequences,\" Noem said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nCNN reported last week that although President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants residing in the United States, the pace of deportations has held steady compared with last year.\n\nNoem told CBS that she wants to see the number of deportations increase and that the administration would help facilitate self-deportations.\n\n\"People remember they have an option to go home on their own. Yeah, we are giving them that opportunity to do that, and we will help facilitate that,\" she said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California criticized his own party for their behavior during Donald Trump's address to Congress last week - citing how members refused to stand for the president and to celebrate a young boy with cancer.\n\n\"That was not a good look,\" Khanna said during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"We should have stood for the boy with cancer. You stand for the president of the United States out of respect for the American people.\"\n\nKhanna asserted that Democrats urgently need to shift from \"talking about our own behavior\" to focusing on their economic message to \"redefine\" the party.\n\nThe California Democrat said he thought Rep. Al Green's heckling of the president at the address warranted the lawmaker's removal, but not censuring, \"because he didn't engage in violence.\" Khanna was not among the 10 Democrats who voted to censure Green on Thursday.\n\n\"He was asked to leave. He left. That was the consequence, and he did that. ... He had a speech right, and I don't think that that should be censured in terms of the free speech of the country,\" Khanna said.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated Sunday that planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada will go into effect April 2 and continue until President Donald Trump is \"comfortable\" with how both countries are handling the flow of fentanyl.\n\nPressed repeatedly on whether the tariffs would be permanent during an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Lutnick said, \"If fentanyl ends, I think these will come off. But if fentanyl does not end or he's uncertain about it, they will stay this way until he is comfortable.\"\n\nFrom another top adviser: National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett also tied Trump's tariffs to drug policy, saying on ABC's \"This Week\" that the back-and-forth is due to \"a drug war, not a trade war.\"\n\nHassett said the measures against the country's North American neighbors were \"part of the negotiation to get Canada and Mexico to stop shipping fentanyl across our borders, and as we've watched them make progress on the drug war, then we've relaxed some of the tariffs.\"\n\nSome context: While Hassett claimed Sunday that Canada is a \"major source\" of the drug, the country is responsible for a minuscule percentage - 0.2% - of illegal fentanyl imports into the US.\n\nMexico's president, meanwhile, reported a dramatic reduction in the amount of fentanyl seized at the southern border in February from January, garnering praise from Trump.\n\nTrump has highlighted fentanyl trafficking and immigration as key issues impacting his trade policy with Mexico and Canada, but has also broadly framed tariffs as a response to what he says are unfair trade terms between the countries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump downplayed the recent whipsaw of the stock market , stemming from him imposing and then adjusting tariffs , defending his strategy in an interview on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" and saying some tariffs \"may go up\" next month.\n\nTrump, who has frequently pointed to stock market performance as a key measure of his success as president, claimed in the interview that, \"You can't really watch the stock market,\" and said he's trying to \"build a strong country\" in the long term.\n\n\"If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. We have a quarter. We go by quarters. ... And you can't go by that. You have to do what's right. We're building a tremendous foundation for the future,\" Trump told Fox's Maria Bartiromo.\n\nOn Thursday, the president signed executive actions that delayed tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty until April 2. But Trump indicated that tariffs may still increase after that date.\n\n\"The tariffs could go up as time goes by. They may go up,\" Trump said.\n\nAsked if he predicts a recession this year, Trump said, \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of - it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Chip Roy defended the GOP-led funding stopgap plan , saying in an interview on \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" that government should remain open and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency should be given \"more power\" to continue its overhaul of federal agencies .\n\nThe plan, formally unveiled by House Speaker Mike Johnson on Saturday, would provide funding through September 30, staving off a potential March 14 government shutdown and buying time for Republicans to steer key pieces of President Donald Trump's agenda through Congress this summer.\n\nRoy told Fox News that while he's \"no huge proponent\" of a continuing resolution - the name for this type of temporary funding measure - he acknowledges this is a chance to \"freeze spending at current levels\" while \"keeping the lights on for Elon to continue to do what they're doing at DOGE.\"\n\n\"Now we have the chance to freeze spending at current levels, no omnibus, no great big, bloated bill with all the sort of pages we haven't read,\" Roy said.\n\nRoy added that the House Republican conference had a positive conversation with Johnson on Saturday, saying there's \"overwhelming\" support for the bill, but still \"a few folks who don't like it.\"\n\n\"Freezing spending is good, holding defense in place so that we can remodernize the military is good, stopping Democrats is good, no earmarks is good, and let's actually give Elon more power,\" Roy said. \"Again, Democrats desperately want to turn the lights off to stop Elon and DOGE because they know the American people are now getting a glimpse under the hood.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's special envoy for hostages Adam Boehler said Sunday that the US does not know whether freelance journalist Austin Tice, who has been held in Syria since 2012, is alive, but indicated he plans to go to Syria to try to find him.\n\nMonths ago as the Assad regime fell, Tice's family said they had received confirmation he was alive and well , citing a \"significant source,\" and then-President Joe Biden said he believed Tice was alive.\n\n\"Truthfully, I don't know whether Austin is still alive,\" Boehler said in an interview with Jake Tapper on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\"For me, in my job, it's to bring all Americans home, dead or alive. And so Austin is on my list, and I'm going to go to Syria, and I'm going to do the best I can to find out.\"\n\nBoehler did not indicate a timeline for his travel to Syria.\n\n\"If he's there, I'm going to bring him home. If he's dead. I'm going to dig up his remains with the FBI. We do it together, and we'll bring them home to his mom, because that's the right thing to do,\" he said.\n\nBoehler met Austin's mother, Debra, at a hostage day event at the State Department on Thursday.\n\nOn Israel-Hamas peace talks: Separately, Boehler expressed optimism about a potential truce between Israel and Hamas following direct talks with the US-designated terrorist organization this week.\n\n\"I think something could come together within weeks. I will say that I believe there is enough there to make a deal between what Hamas wants and what they've accepted, and what Israel wants and it's accepted. And I think it, I think there is a deal where they can get all of the prisoners out, not just the Americans,\" Boehler told CNN.\n\nHe described the negotiations as \"very helpful\" and a starting point to assess what realistic \"endgame\" Hamas is seeking. Boehler said he believes a long-term truce is possible, and expressed openness to meeting with Hamas again.\n\nRepublican Sen. Rick Scott on Sunday defended Elon Musk's efforts to slash the federal workforce as \"part of the process of balancing the budget,\" but said Musk \"does not have the power to fire people\" and is working with agency heads to reduce staff.\n\n\"We will not get interest rates down, we will not get inflation under control until we balance the budget. That's what we have to do, and Elon Musk is part of the process of balancing the budget,\" the Florida lawmaker told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nScott said despite Musk being the face of massive slashes to the federal workforce and programs, agency heads are responsible for the reduction of staff.\n\n\"Well, Elon Musk does not have the power to fire people. The president of United States is Donald Trump, and the agency heads are the one who manage each of their departments,\" he said.\n\nSome context: This comes after a Cabinet meeting last week in which Trump said that, while he fully backs Musk's efforts, it's ultimately up to agency heads to handle staffing at their respective agencies. The question of who is in charge of the cuts has been subject to mounting legal challenges against the administration.\n\nScott said he believes the administration will \"fix\" any mistakes they make as they decide on cuts.\n\n\"We have got to be very aggressive at figuring out how to do this. So I'm very comfortable that Donald Trump, Elon Musk, their agency heads, they're going to do the best they can. And if they make a mistake, they will fix their mistake. They're willing to work really hard to do the right thing,\" he said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio will be in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from Monday through Wednesday this week to meet with his Ukrainian counterparts, the State Department announced Sunday.\n\nDuring the trip, Rubio will meet with Ukrainian officials \"to advance the President's goal to end the Russia-Ukraine war,\" according to State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce.\n\nWhere things stand: The meeting in Saudi Arabia comes as the two countries work to put their relationship back on solid footing following last month's Oval Office blowup between US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Since the meeting - in which Trump and Vance berated Zelensky over the war, and the Ukrainian leader pushed back on several points - top US officials have been working to right ties.\n\nTrump's special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff previously told reporters that American and Ukrainian officials plan to meet this week in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"Well, President Zelensky sent a letter to the president. I think the president thought that it was a really good, positive first step ... And I think the idea is to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire,\" Witkoff said.\n\nRubio's other meetings: Bruce also announced Rubio will meet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"to discuss ways to advance shared interests in the region and strengthen the U.S.-Saudi relationship.\" The kingdom has been host to key US talks on both the Ukraine conflict and war in the Middle East .\n\nRubio will then travel to Charlevoix, Canada, to meet with his G7 counterparts at the G7 Foreign Ministers meeting. Bruce said the discussions will \"focus on conflicts in the Middle East and Europe, cooperation in Africa and the Indo-Pacific, and stability in the Western Hemisphere.\"\n\nOver the past few days, President Donald Trump announced, implemented and reversed some of his tariff threats for Canada, Mexico and China - leading to uncertainty and whiplash on both Wall Street and Main Street.\n\nCatch up on everything that happened here:\n\nMarch 4: Trump's blanket 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday. The president also doubled the tariff on all Chinese imports to 20% from 10%. The Trump administration said the tariffs were necessary to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States. China and Canada immediately retaliated with tariffs on American goods, threatening to ignite a damaging trade war. Mexico said it would announce retaliatory measures Sunday.\n\nMarch 5: A day later, Trump granted an exemption on auto tariffs on Mexico and Canada for one month. After speaking with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, Trump said he agreed to a reprieve to ensure America's Big Three automakers aren't harmed financially.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the automakers should use the monthlong reprieve to work toward the president's goals of bringing America's auto production back to the United States - an unlikely scenario, because that would require massive hiring, investment and strategic planning.\n\nMarch 6: Trump then on Thursday signed executive actions that delayed tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty until April 2. The USMCA is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, negotiated by Trump during his first term. The executive actions followed a discussion Trump held Thursday with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and negotiations between Canadian and US officials. Sheinbaum also said Thursday that, with the pause in effect, she would not announce the previously planned retaliatory tariffs.\n\nTrump continued to sharply criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canada said it would pause its planned second round of tariffs on over 4,000 US goods until April 2.\n\nMarch 7: But on Friday, Trump threatened new tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy products.\n\n\"Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,\" Trump said in Oval Office remarks Friday, citing Canada's roughly 250% tariff on US dairy exports to the country. Trump said America would match those tariffs dollar-for-dollar.\n\n\"We may do it as early as today, or we'll wait until Monday or Tuesday,\" Trump said, adding that more \"changes and adjustments\" on tariffs should be expected.\n\nAs the Pentagon and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency set their sights on climate-related programs at the Defense Department, officials and experts are warning that slashing them could put US troops and military operations at risk.\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other senior Pentagon officials have pointed to climate programs as a prime example of wasteful spending in the military.\n\nIn response to questions on the issue from CNN, Pentagon press secretary John Ullyot said the department is working with DOGE to identify efficiencies and savings across the department in an effort to \"refocus our military on its core mission of deterring, fighting and winning wars.\"\n\n\"Climate zealotry and other woke chimeras of the Left are not part of that core mission,\" Ullyot said.\n\nBut some officials and experts argue such thinking is short-sighted.\n\n\"I think they're stuck on the word 'climate' and not seeing the operational impacts,\" one US official said, adding that the cuts will pose \"readiness issues all around.\"\n\nDr. Ravi Chaudhary, former assistant secretary of the Air Force for energy, installations and environment, told CNN climate programs are not just important to giving the US military an edge on adversaries like China, but they also help keep service members and their families safe.\n\nOfficials who spoke to CNN pointed to a number of programs within the Defense Department that could technically be tagged as climate-related but have real operational impacts on the military.\n\nMaking military installations more resilient to extreme weather events, for example, could save the Pentagon billions in the long term as wildfires and hurricanes become more common and more intense . In 2019, the Air Force requested $5 billion to rebuild two major bases after hurricanes and flooding caused severe damage.\n\nRead more here on the potential impact of cutting the programs .\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson formally unveiled plans on Saturday for a government funding stopgap through September 30 - a measure intended to stave off a potential March 14 shutdown and buy time for Donald Trump and GOP leaders to steer key pieces of the president's agenda through Congress this summer.\n\nWhile GOP leadership aides stressed that the plan includes no partisan policy add-ons, it does include certain White House funding requests, such as some new money intended to help carry out additional deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nTrump backs the bill: The president himself on Saturday endorsed the measure, which includes some cuts to domestic spending programs. GOP leadership aides said Saturday that it would increase defense spending by about $6 billion while domestic spending would drop by about $13 billion.\n\n\"The House and Senate have put together, under the circumstances, a very good funding Bill (\"CR\")! All Republicans should vote (Please!) YES next week,\" Trump said in a post to social media on Saturday, in a direct push for his party to back the bill.\n\nWhat Democrats are saying: In an ominous sign for Congress' ability to stave off a shutdown this week, House Democratic leaders quickly slammed the door on supporting the measure, raising the specter of a high-stakes clash.\n\nTop Democrats said they plan to vote against the bill, arguing it \"recklessly cuts\" domestic spending programs.\n\n\"The legislation does nothing to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, while exposing the American people to further pain throughout this fiscal year. We are voting No,\" Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic Whip Katherine Clark and Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said in a joint statement Saturday evening.\n\nRead more on the looming government spending fight here.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Adam Schiff on Sunday said the party's lack of coordinated response to President Donald Trump's address to Congress last week - with interruptions, walkouts and props - was a \"mistake.\"\n\n\"Frankly, it took the focus off of where it should have been,\" Schiff said on ABC's \"This Week.\"\n\nThe California lawmaker lambasted Trump for not adequately addressing bringing costs down for Americans during the speech, which ran over an hour and a half.\n\n\"There was nothing for American people, and that's where we need to keep our focus,\" he said.\n\nSchiff said the party needs to be focused on \"kitchen-table\" issues like cost of living, affordable housing and how Americans will be impacted by the Trump administration's policies. He said deviation from that focus cost Democrats the election.\n\n\"That's why we lost the last election, because we weren't razor focused on - laser focused - on the high cost of living,\" he said. \"And what they're doing now is just making it so much worse than the administration. And that's really what we need to emphasize.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

      "text": "February 24, 2025: Donald Trump presidency news\n\n• Musk's new message: Elon Musk said tonight that federal workers who do not respond to a weekend email asking them to justify their jobs will be given another opportunity \"subject to the discretion of the President\" and warned that they would still be fired if they didn't reply a second time. Hours earlier, the Office of Personnel Management notified government agencies that responding to Musk's email , which President Donald T rump praised as \"pretty ingenious,\" was voluntary.\n\n• Trump-Macron meeting: French President Emmanuel Macron said he and Trump made \" substantive steps forward\" during talks on ending the Ukraine war. Trump said they agreed on important issues, although he also repeated a false claim about US and European spending on the war, which Macron corrected him on in the Oval Office.\n\n• Setback for AP: A federal judge declined today to temporarily restore the Associated Press' access to some of Trump's events, the Oval Office and Air Force One.\n\nOur live coverage of Donald Trump's presidency has ended for the day. Follow the latest updates or read through the posts below.\n\nEmployees at the Office of Personnel Management were left in the dark about how to handle the initial \"what did you do last week\" email until about 6 p.m. today, when they received guidance saying a response was voluntary but strongly encouraged, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n\nOPM told its own employees the exercise of listing weekly accomplishments is currently voluntary, but the agency may consider making it a mandatory requirement for its employees. The guidance also instructs OPM employees to not send any confidential, sensitive, privileged or investigative information.\n\nThe original email sent to federal workers said the deadline for submission is Monday at 11:59 p.m. ET.\n\nGOP Sen. John Curtis of Utah posted on X that he was \"deeply troubled\" by the US vote against a United Nations General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\n\"I was deeply troubled by the vote at the UN today which put us on the same side as Russia and North Korea. These are not our friends,\" Curtis said. \"This posture is a dramatic shift from American ideals of freedom and democracy. We all want an end to the war, but it must be achieved on terms that ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and security and that deter Putin from pursuing further territorial ambitions.\"\n\nThe vote against the Ukrainian and European-backed resolution saw the US at odds with its longtime European allies and instead aligned with the aggressor in the war on the three-year anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRep. Rich McCormick, who faced tough questions at a town hall in his Georgia district last week about the Trump administration's early actions to slash the federal government, said tonight he would like to see the cuts approached with compassion.\n\nHe told reporters he believes government was designed to be \"inefficient on purpose, so it would never become more powerful than the people themselves and that requires patience.\"\n\nThe Georgia Republican pointed to the months of severance the administration had promised to some federal workers if they stepped aside from their jobs.\n\n\"They have vested interests in their retirement. I want to have compassion. I think Elon Musk talked to us about that a long time, a couple years ago. He said, before he was politically involved, he said, 'Look, the Republican Party can do better by coming across some more compassion.' And I think that's really important,\" McCormick said, referring to the Tesla CEO who is now a top adviser on the administration's efforts to cut back government, though the White House will not say who is officially leading the effort.\n\nRep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, who signed a letter with other New York Republicans urging the Trump administration to protect a 9/11 health program that had experienced workforce cuts, said the White House had told him that the cuts weren't intentional.\n\n\"That's why they reversed them, and I applaud the White House for doing that and fixing that,\" he said.\n\nElon Musk said tonight that federal workers who do not respond to an email they received over the weekend telling them to state their weekly accomplishments will be given another opportunity \"subject to the discretion of the President\" and warned that they would still be fired if they didn't reply a second time.\n\nThe tech billionaire and ally of President Donald Trump said this in a post on X hours after the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) formally notified government agencies that responding to the email was voluntary and that failing to reply wouldn't amount to a resignation. Several national security agencies, including the FBI, and multiple other federal departments advised staffers not to respond to the email immediately.\n\nThe weekend email came from the Office of Personnel Management's new HR email address but had no signature. The subject line reads: \"What did you do last week?\"\n\nIt asked federal workers to explain what work they did last week, and Musk had separately announced that \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to the White House and OPM for comment.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson wouldn't commit to holding a vote tomorrow on a budget blueprint that Republicans must pass to unlock President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\nJohnson is facing resistance from key corners of his conference. He can only afford to lose one Republican vote on the floor - and it's unclear whether he will be able to lock down the votes he needs.\n\nAsked about the schedule, Johnson said, \"We'll see about the timing.\" He added that more conversations would continue tonight. \"All I do are meetings,\" Johnson quipped on his way out the Capitol door.\n\n\"We are prepared to go if we are ready to go and if the members are ready to go. It's a member-driven process,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said.\n\nWhere things stand: Two Republicans - Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Tim Burchett of Tennessee - have said they oppose the measure, which must be passed by both chambers to unlock procedural powers to pass Trump priorities on a party-line vote in the Senate without the threat of the filibuster.\n\nIn addition, GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey told CNN he spoke with Trump today and said he had deep reservations about voting to advance the budget blueprint due to potential cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nVan Drew said Trump was understanding of his concerns, and following the call, Van Drew was still undecided, leaning against the budget.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said a truce between Ukraine and Russia could be reached in \"the weeks to come,\" but cautioned that Western allies must ensure Russia honors its agreements.\n\n\"It's important first to have a truce. I think it could be done in the weeks to come,\" he said today in an interview with Fox News. \"I think it's feasible to have a truce at least and start negotiating for a sustainable peace. But we need something substantial for Ukraine, for the Europeans and the security, for the US and its credibility,\" he added.\n\nDuring the ceasefire period, Russia and the West could negotiate security guarantees for Ukraine. After that, they could have a peace treaty, which he said the West must ensure Russia doesn't violate.\n\nTo guarantee Ukraine's security, the French president proposed boosting its military capabilities, and - if requested - to deploy British and French troops to keep the peace.\n\nSome background: Macron discussed Ukraine today with President Donald Trump at the White House. He stressed repeatedly the necessity of security guarantees to ensure Moscow keeps its promises this time around, and said any agreement must be \"checked and verified.\"\n\nUS Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth will travel to Guantanamo Bay on Tuesday to receive briefings \"on all mission operations,\" which will include the ongoing operation to transfer migrants to the base, the Pentagon said in a news release today.\n\nThis will be Hegseth's first trip to Guantanamo Bay as secretary. While on the visit, he will also meet the US service members at the base and aboard the USS Thomas Hudner.\n\nLast week, more than 170 migrants at the naval base were flown to Venezuela, nearly emptying Guantanamo. Since then, 17 migrants have been brought to the detention facility portion of the base, CNN reported . No migrants are in the Migrant Operation Center, or MOC.\n\nTwo Republican senators on Monday criticized the handling and coordination of the email sent to federal workers asking them to explain and justify their work .\n\n\"My understanding is that they walked that back and say 'It's voluntary.' Good,\" said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and a member of the Appropriations Committee. \"I don't think it was handled very well in terms of the surprise element of it or what the point of it was. I mean that I think was confusing because I think there were a couple different explanations. So I think a little clarification on the voluntary part is probably good.\"\n\nEmployees began receiving emails Saturday afternoon from the Office of Personnel Management asking them to explain what work they did last week, as Elon Musk announced that \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\"\n\nSen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who sits on the Governmental Affairs Committee, agreed.\n\n\"The statement, I guess, on that did not look very well coordinated. And so we're still trying to go figure it out because several agencies immediately stepped out and said, 'Hey, not us, not our people.' So we're trying to figure out where was that, where did that come from and why did that go out that way?\"\n\nEarlier, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN that that the employees deserve to be treated in a \"respectful and dignified manner,\" but he also defended Musk's effort as necessary to cut the costs of the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services told its employees this evening that if they respond to an Office of Personnel Management email asking what they did last week, they should \"assume that what you write will be read by malign foreign actors and tailor your response accordingly.\"\n\nThe guidance came late in the day, according to three sources at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - agencies under the HHS umbrella.\n\nHere's more details from the emailed guidance for employees:\n\nAlso this afternoon, OPM formally notified agencies that response to the email is voluntary and that failure to respond wouldn't equate to a resignation, as suggested previously by Elon Musk.\n\nAfter public outcry, the United States Department of Agriculture has reopened a scholarship program aimed at putting young people at historically Black colleges and universities on the path to careers in agriculture, food safety and environmental science.\n\n\"The USDA 1890s National Scholars Program application period has been reopened, and applications will be accepted through March 15th. Please check this page again for information about upcoming webinars,\" the site reads .\n\nLast week the Congressional Black Caucus called out the Trump administration for freezing the decades-old 1890 Scholars Program that, if selected, provided students with full tuition covered fees, books, room and board at 1890 land-grant universities.\n\nDemocratic members of Congress slammed the suspension of the program, arguing it is evidence of further hostility toward marginalized groups following executive orders aimed at dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives across the government.\n\nUS President Donald Trump met today with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. They also had two interactions with the media - in the Oval Office and during a more formal news conference - at which they spoke at length about Russia's war in Ukraine, which has been raging for three years.\n\nIn Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hosted several international leaders to mark the invasion's third anniversary. He said he hopes 2025 brings a \"real, lasting\" end to the war.\n\nHere are the top lines from the Trump-Macron meeting at the White House:\n\nMeanwhile, in other news about Ukraine:\n\nLawmakers and other officials are defending the Trump administration's move to query federal employees about what they accomplished last week. It's the latest in President Donald Trump and the new Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to remake the federal government.\n\nEmployees began receiving emails Saturday afternoon from the Office of Personnel Management asking them to explain what work they did last week, as Elon Musk announced that \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\"\n\nBut, Monday afternoon, OPM said responses to the email are voluntary , according to an email CNN obtained. The initial email said employees had until midnight Monday to respond.\n\nHere's the latest developments:\n\nUS Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the decision to remove three senior lawyers for the Army, Navy, and Air Force, saying the move is meant to remove \"roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.\"\n\n\"It's not about roadblocks to an agenda,\" he said in response to a question during a meeting with Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman. \"It's roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief. So ultimately, I want the best possible lawyers in each service to provide the best possible recommendations, no matter what, to lawful orders that are given. And we didn't think those particular positions were well-suited, and so we're looking for the best.\"\n\nHegseth did not provide any specifics on how the three officers in those positions now have been \"roadblocks\" to orders by a president or how they were not \"well-suited\" to their roles.\n\nHe announced Friday in a highly unusual move that he was \"requesting nominations\" to place the three senior judge advocates general for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He then said Sunday that they were being removed because the administration wants lawyers \"who give sound constitutional advice and don't exist to attempt to be roadblocks to anything.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate are preparing to face off over energy this week, with Democrats planning to force a vote in an attempt to terminate President Trump's national energy emergency declaration and Republicans preparing votes on repealing certain Biden administration energy rules.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Martin Heinrich introduced their resolution to terminate Trump's national energy emergency declaration in early February. Since the resolution is considered privileged, they expect to force a vote on it this week.\n\n\"The United States is producing more energy than at any other point in history. So why would Donald Trump spend his first day in office declaring a national energy emergency, and then halt crucial investments from the Inflation Reduction Act that are creating jobs, lowering energy costs, and supporting American leadership in the clean energy industries of tomorrow?\" Kaine said in a statement, saying that \"Trump will do anything for Big Oil.\"\n\nTo counter this Democratic resolution, Republicans are working to schedule votes repealing two energy rules from the Biden era. One resolution, introduced by GOP Sen. John Hoeven, would end a methane fee requirement for some oil and natural gas companies.\n\nThis rule was passed as part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, and directed the Environmental Protection Agency to collect fees from some oil and natural gas companies based on the amount of methane they release into the atmosphere.\n\nThe other GOP-led vote would be on ending a Biden-era rule that requires drilling companies and leasees to submit a marine archaeological report before they begin drilling anywhere on the Outer Continental Shelf, to ensure they do not interrupt shipwrecks or other archeological sites. This act was introduced by Sen. John Kennedy.\n\nA US-led resolution that did not call Russia the aggressor in the war in Ukraine passed in the United Nations Security Council with support from Moscow and without the backing of the US' European allies.\n\nThe extraordinary shift in US policy toward Ukraine has put the Trump administration at odds with its key allies in Europe and resulted in the US voting the same way as Russia twice at the United Nations Monday.\n\nThe Security Council resolution, which is three paragraphs long and does not affirm Ukraine's sovereignty, passed with 10 votes in favor and five abstentions. Russia voted in favor, while longtime US allies France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Denmark and Slovenia abstained.\n\nPrior to the vote, Russian Ambassador to the UN Vasily Nebenzya commended the US resolution \"as a common sense initiative, as a step in the right direction.\"\n\nFollowing the vote, the US charge d'affaires Dorothy Shea called its passage the Security Council's first action \"to firmly call for an end to the conflict.\"\n\n\"This resolution puts us on the path to peace. It is a first step, but a crucial one, one of which we should all be proud now we must use it to build a peaceful future for Ukraine, Russia and the international community,\" she said.\n\nThere was however strong reaction from European nations:\n\nA federal judge declined today to temporarily restore the Associated Press' access to some of President Donald Trump's events, the Oval Office and Air Force One.\n\nUS District Judge Trevor McFadden turned down a request from AP to temporarily lift a ban Trump imposed earlier this month to punish the news organization over its decision to continue using the phrase \"Gulf of Mexico\" even though Trump renamed the body of water \"Gulf of America.\"\n\nRead more details here about the judge's order.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management formally notified agencies this afternoon that the \"What did you do last week\" email sent over the weekend is voluntary and failure to respond will not equate to a resignation, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n\nAccording to the email sent to Department of Justice's human resources officials, a meeting was held this afternoon among the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, which usually consists of the top human resources officer from every department.\n\nDuring the meeting, OPM \"informed agencies that employee responses to the OPM email is voluntary. Employees who elect to respond to the email must not include any confidential, sensitive, or classified information. OPM also clarified that a non-response to the email does not equate to a resignation,\" the guidance reads.\n\nThat guidance runs counter to what Elon Musk said, which was that \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he and President Donald Trump made \"substantive steps forward\" during their meeting today, emphasizing their shared desire to build peace - but warning that it won't happen if Ukraine is forced to surrender.\n\n\"This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine. It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty and allow Ukraine to negotiate with other stakeholders,\" Macron said at a joint news conference with Trump at the White House.\n\nThe French president commended the US leader for his \"decision to work with President (Volodymyr) Zelensky, and to conclude this agreement that's so important for the US and Ukraine on rare earths, critical minerals, but also having substantive conversations with President Zelensky, doing this key phase of achieving this deal, which is a major commitment to Ukraine sovereignty.\"\n\nMacron added that \"after speaking with President Trump, I fully believe that there is a path forward,\" saying that they \"share the same beliefs\" on forging a lasting peace. He also said he agrees with the US president that a peace deal must be reached \"swiftly,\" but added \"we don't want an agreement that is weak.\"\n\n\"The fact that there are Europeans that are ready to engage, to provide for these security guarantees, and now there's a clear American message that the US as an ally is ready to provide that solidarity for that approach - that's a turning point, in my view,\" Macron said, speaking from Washington. \"And that is one of the great areas of progress that we've made during this trip and during this discussion.\"\n\nTrump said that he believes Macron agrees with him on \"many of the most important issues,\" including that this is the right time to end the war.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional remarks from Macron.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said today that the imposition of tariffs on Canada and Mexico will go forward on schedule.\n\n\"We're on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that's moving along very rapidly,\" he said at a joint news conference at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron as he repeated his complaint that other countries have taken advantage of the United States. \"The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,\" he added.\n\nIt comes after the initial deadline for the tariffs on Canada and Mexico - February 1, 2025 - was paused by the president .\n\nSome context: Trump said that all America wants is trade fairness and to meet tariffs with dollar-for-dollar reciprocity . But the tariffs Trump levied and then delayed on Canada and Mexico were not reciprocal tariffs - they are part of a free trade agreement with the United States.\n\nPresident Donald Trump repeated a false claim that the United States is spending much more money on the war in Ukraine than countries in Europe, speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday.\n\n\"The United States has put up far more aid for Ukraine than any other nation,\" Trump said at a joint news conference with Macron.\n\n\"We've spent more than $300 billion, and Europe has spent about 100 -$100 billion. That's a big difference and at some point we should equalize,\" he said.\n\nDuring their Oval Office meeting earlier today, Macron interrupted Trump to correct his US counterpart on the nature of European support for Ukraine.\n\nFact check: In fact, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank that closely tracks wartime aid to Ukraine , the European Union and individual European countries had collectively committed far more total wartime military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine through December (about $258 billion) than the US had committed (about $124 billion).\n\nEurope had also allocated more military, financial and humanitarian aid (about $138 billion) than the US had allocated (about $119 billion).\n\nThe US did have a slim lead in one particular category, military aid allocated, providing about $67 billion to about $65 billion for Europe. But even that was nowhere close to the gap Trump described.\n\nThis post has been updated with more details about the Macron and Trump meeting.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron are holding a joint news conference Monday after their bilateral meeting earlier this afternoon in the Oval Office.\n\nThe two leaders also participated in a call with G7 summit leaders.\n\nMacron's visit to the White House today comes on the third year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. European leaders are rushing to try to reclaim a central role for themselves and for Ukraine after they were cut out of US-Russia talks on ending the war.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said that Ukraine could \"perhaps\" recover some of its Russia-occupied land, but said that it is not an \"easy thing to do.\"\n\n\"That's not an easy thing to do,\" Trump told reporters who asked whether Ukraine could take back the land it has lost during three years at war. \"I say that, yeah, perhaps some of it,\" he said in the Oval Office with France's President Emmanuel Macron sitting by his side. \"I hope so,\" the US president added, before saying \"it's going to be something we will be talking about,\" referring to Macron.\n\nIn the three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, Ukraine has lost control of about 11% of its land , according to CNN analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War, a US-based conflict monitor.\n\nTrump also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept European troops as peacekeepers in Ukraine.\n\n\"Yeah, he will accept that. I've asked him that question,\" Trump said in the Oval Office.\n\nHe added that the troops would go into Ukraine to ensure that \"everything is followed properly.\"\n\n\"Troops may go into Ukraine as peacemakers, so when the agreement is done, they can watch that everything is followed properly. I don't think that's going to be a problem,\" Trump said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky \"may come\" to Washington this week or next as the two countries are \"very close\" to coming to an agreement on a rare earths minerals deal.\n\n\"I will be meeting with President Zelensky. In fact, he may come in this week or next week to sign the agreement and... which would be nice, I'd love to meet him. We'd meet at the Oval Office. So the agreements being worked on now. They're very close to a final deal. It'll be a deal with rare earths and various other things. And he would like to come, as I understand it, here, to sign it and that would be great with me,\" Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with France's President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe president's comments come as a finalized draft of the US-Ukraine resources agreement has been presented to the Trump administration and centers on a framework for a reconstruction fund for Ukraine, leaving problematic technical details, including security guarantees to later discussions, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the negotiation.\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent - who was in the room - added that an agreement is \"very close.\"\n\n\"We are very close, one yard line,\" Bessent said.\n\nWith regards to Russia: Trump on Monday said he would be open to an economic development partnership with Russia - but added that his first priority is ending the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe president's response came after he was asked about an earlier Truth Social post where he said he was in \"serious discussions\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin about \"the ending of the War, and also major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia.\"\n\nTrump expanded on those comments later in the Oval Office, saying, \"You know, they have massive rare earth. It's a very large - it's actually the largest in terms of land. It's by far the largest country. And they have very valuable things that we could use, and we have things that they could use, and it would be very good if we could do that. I think it would be a very good thing for world peace and lasting peace.\"\n\nThis post has been updated with more of Trump's comments.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine must be included in talks to end the war between them, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday.\n\n\"The path to a just and lasting peace can only be opened with an equation in which all relevant parties are represented,\" Erdogan said at a news conference.\n\nPrevious peace talks had excluded Russia from the negotiating table, Erdogan pointed out, which had prevented them from achieving the \"desired result.\" Meanwhile, more recent talks have excluded Ukraine.\n\n\"If results are desired from the new process, Ukraine must be included in the process and this war must be ended through mutual negotiations,\" Erdogan said.\n\nThe Turkish leader's comments came less than a week after Ukrainian officials were not invited to US-Russia talks on the conflict. US President Donald Trump, speaking at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, said the talks were \"very good\" and that Russia \"wants to do something.\"\n\nErdogan said that he had spoken to Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday and to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky the day before.\n\n\"As a state that has earned the trust of both countries with its balanced attitude, we will do our best for a lasting and just peace,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he doesn't use the word dictator lightly when asked by a reporter Monday if he would use that label for Russian President Vladimir Putin, as he did for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week.\n\n\"I don't use those words lightly. I think that we're going to see how it all works out,\" Trump said. \"Let's see what happens,\" he added, speaking in the Oval Office alongside French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\"And you know, you're talking about Europe, and you're talking about Ukraine as part of that whole situation, the other side has a lot of support also,\" Trump continued.\n\nThe US president has repeatedly declined to answer questions about whether Putin is a dictator.\n\nWhat Macron is saying: The French president said in joint remarks with Trump that France is ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine, and that US \"re-engagement means more uncertainty for [Russian President] Vladimir Putin.\"\n\n\"This is what President Trump means when he says there won't be any more problems. I think the strength of the US re-engagement means more uncertainty for Vladimir Putin. So, there is a capacity of deterrence that is there, which will allow a truce to take place initially,\" Macron said.\n\n\"Capacity to verify that respecting of the ceasefire and a peace deal, which will allow to rebuild Ukraine and bring also security guarantees, and in the framework of these security guarantees we think we have a role to play,\" Macron added.\n\nMacron was responding to Trump's comment earlier in the joint remarks from the Oval Office, in which the US president said that Europe is going to ensure \"nothing happens\" in Ukraine after a deal and said war won't be a \"big problem.\"\n\nCNN's Pierre Bairin, Melissa Bell, and Lauren Kent contributed reporting to this post. This post has been updated with comments from Macron.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday called an email sent to federal workers from the Office of Personnel Management asking them what they had done over the past week a \"pretty ingenious idea,\" and said he will assume that anyone who doesn't respond is \"not around.\"\n\nAnd the president said that anyone who doesn't answer is \"semi-fired, or fired.\"\n\nHis comments come as a rift appeared to open Sunday between some of Trump's agency heads and Elon Musk, the billionaire tasked with cutting government spending, over Musk's demand that all federal employees state their weekly accomplishments or risk termination.\n\nAsked whether there was a communication disconnect because some agencies - including the FBI and State Department - told their employees not to respond to the Saturday email, Trump said \"no.\"\n\n\"That was done in a friendly manner,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. \"And they don't mean that in any way combatively with Elon,\" he added about the agency heads who told their employees to disregard the email.\n\n\"But other than that, I think everyone thought it was a pretty ingenious idea,\" Trump said. \"We have to find out where these people are. Who are they? And we said, 'If you don't respond, we assume you're not around, and you're not getting paid anymore, too.'\"\n\n\"I think it was actually, there was a lot of genius in sending it. We're trying to find out if people are working and so we're sending a letter to people, 'please tell us what you did last week.' If people don't respond, it's very possible that there is no such person or they're not working.\"\n\nWatch Trump's remarks:\n\nOver the weekend, federal employees received an email asking them what work they did in the previous week, and Elon Musk posted on X that \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\" President Donald Trump called the email \"ingenious\" during a bilateral meeting in the Oval Office with France's President Emmanuel Macron. According to an email CNN obtained, the Office of Personnel Management told agencies that responding to the email employees received over the weekend is voluntary and failure to respond will not equate to a resignation. #cnn #news\n\nA federal judge partially paused the Trump administration's new policy giving wider latitude for immigration enforcement at some churches and other houses of worship in the first ruling considering the policy's legality.\n\nMonday's temporary order from US District Judge Theodore Chuang is a narrow victory for the religious organizations challenging the new policy in court. Chuang blocked the administration from carrying the policy at the places of worship of any of the religious organizations that brought the lawsuit, which included congregations of Quakers, Baptists and Sikhs. But he declined to pause the policy nationwide.\n\nThere are several cases challenging the Trump policy, and Chuang is the first to weigh in on its legality.\n\nHe concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their arguments that it violated the First Amendment as well as a religious liberty law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. For the religious organizations covered under his ruling, the administration must return to the federal government's pre-Trump policy that allowed for some immigration enforcement at churches, but under much more narrow circumstances.\n\nChuang wrote in his 56-page opinion that he was not questioning law enforcement's ability \"when necessary\" to \"conduct operations in or near places of worship.\"\n\n\"The Court only finds at this early stage of the case, on the sensitive and fraud issue of when and under what circumstances law enforcement may intrude into places of worship to conduct warrantless operations, the 2025 Policy's lack of any meaningful limitations or safeguards on such activity likely does not satisfy these constitutional and statutory requirements as to Plaintiffs,\" he wrote.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post misspelled Judge Theodore Chuang's last name.\n\nMT Snyder, a field examiner with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), was one of the federal workers who received an email on Saturday afternoon asking her to describe what she accomplished in her job in the past week.\n\nIt's part of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's latest move targeting the federal workforce, as Musk announced that \" failure to respond will be taken as a resignation .\"\n\n\"I felt absolutely infuriated getting this email with a demand within 48 hours to provide a response in what I did within the last week or face termination,\" Snyder told CNN in her personal capacity - not on behalf of her federal agency. She is also an organizer with the Federal Unionists Network.\n\nSnyder said she sees this as an attempt from Musk \"to harass and bully and intimidate the federal workforce.\"\n\nIt is a part of \"his broader plan to gut the federal workforce and privatize public sector services to ensure that corporations like his own can get more profit. And that makes me really angry, and my coworkers as well.\"\n\nSnyder said she is still waiting for guidance on what to do with this email, and she will not be responding unless her agency or supervisor instructs her to do so.\n\n\"I am totally happy to talk about the work that I do, upholding the National Labor Relations Act and ensuring that those who come to the Board get justice and their rights are upheld. But I will not do that in a way that violates the integrity or the privacy of my work, of the American people we are serving,\" she said.\n\nLeaders at the Pentagon, Federal Bureau of Investigation, State Department, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Energy have instructed their staff not to reply to the email that federal workers received from the Office of Personnel Management asking them to state what they have done in their job the past week, appearing to contradict Musk for the first time.\n\nLeaders at the Justice Department instructed staff not to respond to an email demanding that employees state their weekly accomplishments, according to an email obtained by CNN.\n\nDOJ is the latest in a series of federal agencies - including the Pentagon, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Energy - who have told staff not to respond to the email .\n\n\"Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of the Department's work, DOJ employees do not need to respond to the email from OPM,\" the Justice Department email says, referring to the United States Office of Personnel Management. \"If you have already responded to this email, no further action is needed.\"\n\nFederal employees have until midnight ET today to respond to the mass email, which demanded they explain their work. Elon Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency, warned that failure to respond \"will be taken as a resignation.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron attempted to correct his US counterpart on the nature of European support for Ukraine during Oval Office talks on Monday, interrupting President Donald Trump as he spoke to note he was misstating the facts.\n\nThe extraordinary moment underscored the strained dynamics of Monday's talks. While Trump and Macron otherwise appeared friendly and willing to engage on the future of Ukraine, the talks have been against the backdrop of Trump's sometimes-false statements about the war effort.\n\n\"Just so you understand, Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine. They're getting their money back,\" Trump began as he was preparing to make the case for a new deal to secure Ukraine's mineral revenues as back-payment for American assistance.\n\nMacron reached over to grab Trump's arm to interject.\n\n\"No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort. It was like the US: loans, guarantees, grants,\" he said. \"We have $230 billion in frozen assets in Europe, Russian assets. But this is not collateral of a loan because it is not our belonging. So they are frozen.\"\n\nTrump seemed to shrug off the interjection: \"If you believe that, it's OK with me. They get their money back, and we don't. But now we do.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has halted efforts to place migrants in tent structures built at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba, amid concerns that the emerging facilities don't meet detention standards because they lack air conditioning or electricity, a US official and a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nIt comes weeks after officials scrambled to set up additional housing for migrants at the controversial US base on the island - and only days after those on location were deported. While the tent structures are currently not being used, migrants are still being placed in the detention facility on the base, and at the Migrant Operations Center, or MOC.\n\nThe Trump administration said it would be building out tent structures at Guantanamo Bay to house an anticipated 30,000 people transferred there from the southern border. But the sources said Monday that the tents don't currently meet detention standards set by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The two sources, and a third US official, also said there haven't been enough people transferred to the base to justify building more.\n\nThe situation is indicative of the harried efforts undertaken by the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to house migrants at the naval base, after President Donald Trump ordered the move in January. Sources previously told CNN the mission has been embroiled in confusion and conflicting internal messaging over who is in charge and what will happen to migrants once they arrive.\n\nThe Pentagon referred questions to US Southern Command.\n\nLast week, more than 170 migrants at the naval base were flown to Venezuela, nearly emptying Guantanamo. Since then, 17 migrants have been brought to the detention facility portion of the base, the official said.\n\nAs the National Park Service has reportedly fired about 1,000 employees as part of the Trump administration's culling of probationary federal workers, some parks and monuments are announcing reductions in services.\n\nCNN has reached out to the service to inquire whether these cutbacks are directly related to the staffing reductions and if more service impacts are expected and has not received a response.\n\nThe NPS has promised to hire thousands of seasonal workers, following the job cuts, according to the Associated Press .\n\nHere's a look at some of the reductions in services:\n\nOver the weekend, employees at Yosemite hung an upside-down American flag over the side of El Capitan to protest the recent downsizing. Gavin Carpenter, a maintenance mechanic with Yosemite, spoke to the San Francisco Chronicle on Saturday and said he supplied the flag and helped hang it.\n\n\"We're bringing attention to what's happening to the parks, which are every American's properties. It's super important we take care of them, and we're losing people here, and it's not sustainable if we want to keep the parks open.\"\n\nCNN's Amanda Jackson and Sharif Paget contributed reporting to this post.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy said that Moscow is open for \"economic cooperation\" with the United States, following President Donald Trump's social media post where he said he is discussing \"major\" economic deals with the country.\n\n\"Russia is open for US Russia economic cooperation and believes such cooperation is key for a more resilient global economy,\" said special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who chaired economic discussions from the Russian side in negotiations with the US last week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Dmitriev said that in the first stage of economic cooperation with the US would be \"including energy\" but gave no further details.\n\nTrump posted earlier Monday that he is in \"serious discussions\" with Putin \"concerning the ending of the War, and also major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia. Talks are proceeding very well.\"\n\nIt comes hours after the European Union adopted its 16th sanctions package against Russia.\n\nPresident Donald Trump posted a readout of his Monday morning G7 virtual meeting, which French President Emmanuel Macron joined him for in the Oval Office.\n\n\"The meeting was convened by Governor Justin Trudeau of Canada, the current chair of G7, to acknowledge the Third Anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine War,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nTrump repeated his claim that the war \"would have never started if I was President\" and emphasized the need for a resolution. He highlighted the proposed \"Critical Minerals and Rare-Earths Deal,\" between the US and Ukraine, which he said he hoped \"will be signed very soon.\"\n\nA finalized draft of the US-Ukraine resources agreement has been presented to the Trump administration and centers on a framework for a reconstruction fund for Ukraine, leaving problematic technical details, including security guarantees to later discussions, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the negotiation.\n\nAdditionally, Trump said that he is in \"serious discussions\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding both an end to the war and future US-Russia economic development, stating that those talks are \"proceeding very well.\"\n\n\"At the same time, I am in serious discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia concerning the ending of the War, and also major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia. Talks are proceeding very well,\" Trump's post read.\n\nThis comes after Ukraine was not invited to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia last week, Trump echoed Kremlin disinformation about how the war in Ukraine began and later called Zelensky a dictator . European leaders held an emergency meeting in Paris, as they grappled for the first time in decades with how to bolster the continent's security without US assistance.\n\nCNN's Victoria Butenko, Daria Tarasova-Markina, Svitlana Vlasova and Christian Edwards contributed reporting to this post.\n\nGOP Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, who is a co-chair of the House's caucus on the Department of Government Efficiency, faced questions over the weekend from constituents at a town hall regarding the agency run by Elon Musk.\n\nSessions is one of several Republican lawmakers who are facing criticism and tough questions from their constituents about DOGE and the Trump administration's agenda that has impacted thousands of Americans across the country.\n\nSessions described his town hall as \"quite civil\" and a \"thoughtful, articulate, meeting\" where people expressed their views and he shared information and data about DOGE's efforts. He pushed back on how some news outlets have described the town hall.\n\nAsked by CNN's Pamela Brown what he plans to do with the feedback he received, Sessions said, \"I do recognize that the American people do have questions and they do need answers, and we owe them those answers, but it is certainly one that finds itself and lends itself to not all the answers are necessarily available right now so, feel free, any questions that you've got, I'm ready.\"\n\nSessions defended on CNN the tactics of the agency and Trump administration to reduce the federal workforce and pursue its agenda.\n\n\"The things that are occurring are not always apparent to everybody, but our country has faced a changed, a change was voted for Donald Trump to bring some of those changes. One of them is our fiscal, our financial nature that the country's engaged in,\" Sessions said.\n\nSessions lamented the pushback DOGE has received after implementing a return to office mandate, the deferred resignation program and the most recent action asking employees to email the Office of Personnel Management about their job and what they accomplish on a weekly basis.\n\n\"Just because you tell us what you do and what importance that is, is not an indication that we would not respect that,\" Sessions said.\n\nThe United States abstained from voting for its own United Nations General Assembly resolution marking the anniversary of the war in Ukraine after several amendments were added to the resolution.\n\nThe original draft resolution did not call Russia the aggressor in the war or acknowledge Ukraine's territorial integrity. However, a number of amendments were passed ahead of the vote to strengthen the language against Russia and reaffirm Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\nThe amended US-drafted resolution was then adopted by the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe US is now poised to pit itself against its European allies again later Monday at the UN Security Council, where it is expected to introduce the same resolution that does not blame Russia for the war.\n\nOne amendment added a paragraph reading \"Reaffirming its commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters.\"\n\nAnother amendment changed the language from mourning \"the tragic loss of life throughout the Russia-Ukraine conflict\" to \"the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation.\"\n\nThe General Assembly and Security Council votes come on the anniversary of Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nIt comes days after a high-level US delegation met with the Russians - without Ukraine - to discuss a process to end the war. The US special envoy for Ukraine traveled separately to Kyiv following that meeting. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up his antagonism toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as the US pushes for a mineral deal with Ukraine.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky said he hopes the United States continues its support for Ukraine as he spoke briefly about US President Donald Trump following a public spat between the two leaders last week.\n\n\"We hope that the United States will continue support, like all the partners,\" Zelensky said Monday during a summit of European leaders in Kyiv, to mark the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine.\n\n\"We need also not to lose this unity between Europe and the United States,\" Zelensky added.\n\nAlthough Trump's interventions last week have cast a long shadow over the summit in Kyiv, Zelensky and other leaders have largely avoided mentioning the US president by name during their public remarks.\n\nIn what appears to be the first court case Monday to address the Office of Personnel Management email blast asking federal workers to describe their accomplishments, a group of unions challenging mass firings say the demand that employees respond is unlawful.\n\nThe unions first sued in a California federal court last week in an attempt to block the Trump administration from firing federal employees. But the unions updated their complaint on Sunday, a day after the email address hr@opm.gov asked federal employees to respond.\n\nThe email said the deadline for federal employees to email back five accomplishments they had last week would be Monday at midnight, and Elon Musk wrote on social media those who didn't respond would be \"taken as a resignation.\"\n\nThe unions say the OPM email hadn't been announced in advance in the Federal Register as a policy or program, and so wasn't in compliance with federal regulations.\n\n\"Prior to February 22, 2025, federal employees were not required to submit any reports regarding their work to OPM. On information and belief, no OPM rule, regulation, policy, or program has ever, in United States history, purported to require all federal workers to submit reports to OPM,\" the unions argued.\n\nThe unions have asked for emergency intervention from federal Judge William Alsup, a Bill Clinton appointee, in the Northern District of California. Lawsuits like these have largely failed to get indefinite, emergency intervention from judges.\n\nIn brief order, Alsup scheduled a hearing for Thursday at 4:30 p.m. ET in San Francisco. He said that at the hearing, he will consider a motion for a temporary restraining order on the mass firings.\n\nA previous attempt in a different federal court, in Washington, DC, failed in its initial attempt to limit Musk's use of the hr@opm.gov email blasts. That case centered around a privacy complaint that the email address was improperly collecting government emails and other data, and OPM eventually provided the court a privacy impact assessment on the use of the email address.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nAt nearly the exact time President Donald Trump posted on social media Sunday announcing conservative firebrand Dan Bongino was selected by FBI Director Kash Patel as the bureau's next deputy director, the FBI Agents Association - an organization representing thousands of current and former federal agents - sent a mass email to members welcoming Patel as the new director and outlining the planned collaborative path ahead.\n\nIn their update to members obtained by CNN, the Agents Association said Patel recently agreed that the next FBI deputy director, who serves as the powerful chief operations officer in charge of the bureau's approximately 38,000 employees, should be selected from within the ranks of the organization.\n\nNatalie Barra, president of the Agents Association, told members that the organization's leadership met last month with Patel.\n\n\"During that meeting, we brought two main concerns: 1. That the FBI Deputy Director should continue to be an on-board, active Special Agent as has been the case for 117 years for many compelling reasons, including operational expertise and experience, as well as the trust of our Special Agent population,\" Barra said.\n\nThe message continued, \"2. That any Agents facing allegations of misconduct should be given due process as it relates to those allegations. On both points, Director Patel agreed.\"\n\nRemember : During Trump's first term in office, former Secret Service agent Bongino became a high-profile personality on Fox and gained his own weekend show in 2021. He departed the network two years later, citing a disagreement about a contract extension. But he has remained close to Trump even without the Fox perch; interviewing Trump for his radio show and podcast shortly before the November election and again in January.\n\nA federal judge temporarily on Monday blocked the Department of Education and the US Office of Personnel Management from sharing some sensitive government data with representatives of the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe new order from US District Judge Deborah Boardman, a Biden appointee who sits in Maryland, specifically halts sharing the personal information of roughly 2 million people who are members of the unions who sued over DOGE's access to the data.\n\nThe order will remain in place until the morning of March 10. It comes as judges have already curtailed DOGE access for Department of Treasury data systems.\n\nThe judge wrote in her 33-page opinion that the unions and their members had shown the Trump administration likely violated the Privacy Act by \"disclosing their personal information to DOGE affiliates without their consent.\"\n\n\"DOGE affiliates have been granted access to systems of record that contain some of the plaintiffs' most sensitive data - Social Security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, income and assets, citizenship status, and disability status - and their access to this trove of personal information is ongoing,\" Boardman wrote. \"There is no reason to believe their access to this information will end anytime soon because the government believes their access is appropriate.\"\n\nShe wrote that government hadn't put forward enough information for why DOGE needed the sweeping access to the personal data held by the Education Department.\n\nLikewise, at OPM, she said that the Trump-appointed CIO Greg Hogan had showed in court filings why his duties required access to the sensitive data at that agency, which handles the federal workforce's HR operations. He will continue to have access to the data, under her order, but the other employees installed at the agency to carry out DOGE's mission had not shown why they needed access, the judge wrote.\n\nKeep in mind: The new order is a temporary restraining order, which is not normally subject to appeal, and the judge declined the Justice Department's request to hand down a preliminary injunction, which would be appealable. She will move quickly to that next step, her order indicated, and she suggested she would consider ordering discovery.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nThe Department of Transportation has ordered all of its employees to respond to Elon Musk's \"what did you do last week\" email by Monday's 11:59 p.m. ET deadline, according to an internal memo viewed by CNN.\n\n\"Your response should include a bulleted list of approximately five accomplishments,\" said the email sent at 9 a.m. ET Monday. Musk has said those who don't respond will be fired.\n\nThose who need to reply include the Federal Aviation Administration's chronically understaffed air traffic controller workforce. Many controllers are working mandatory overtime six-day weeks of 10-hour shifts.\n\nOn Saturday, their union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, denounced the move by Musk as a \"distraction\" to controllers during a time when the air safety system is \"fragile.\"\n\nA finalized draft of the US-Ukraine resources agreement has been presented to Washington and centers on a framework for a reconstruction fund for Ukraine, leaving problematic technical details, including security guarantees to later discussions, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the negotiation.\n\nThe source said the \"American side is very much resisting the inclusion of security guarantees\" and Kyiv hopes these could be discussed in a future meeting between Presidents Volodymyr  Zelensky and Donald Trump.\n\n\"Everything is ready from our side,\" the Ukrainian source said. \"We have finalized the draft. We have done as much as we can to make the conditions reasonable. As a result, this is a framework agreement on how to create Ukraine reconstruction fund. There is a separate agreement foreseen on how this one will work.\"\n\nThe source said the \"most problematic points are out of the draft, but the American side is very much resisting to include security guarantees in the document.\"\n\nZelensky said on Sunday during a news conference the figure of $500 billion, first proposed by the Trump administration, was unacceptable and a key disagreement. The source said they hoped for a signing ceremony in which the \"issue of guarantees\" would be for the \"Presidents' consideration.\" The source said: \"We are waiting for the American side's reply.\"\n\nMore background: The US is trying to gain access to Ukraine's critical minerals and other resources as part of wider negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. In return, Ukraine has been pushing for security guarantees, with Kyiv not only keen to see the return of lost territory but protection against a possible future Russian invasion. Ukrainians are still trying to negotiate amendments to the deal because the current draft \"does not foresee any American obligations while Ukraine is expected to provide everything,\" a source said.\n\nCNN's Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.\n\nImmigration agents have been directed to track down and deport thousands of migrant children who entered the US without their parents, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters.\n\nThe memo outlines a plan to deport the unaccompanied minors in four phases -- starting with a planning phase that began on January 17, Reuters reported. The memo reportedly did not mention a start date for enforcement actions.\n\nChildren targeted by ICE agents, according to Reuters, would be required to appear in immigration court or be deported if they had orders pending against them.\n\nICE would then sort children into three priority groups based on data collected from several government records: \"flight risk,\" \"public safety,\" and \"border security.\"\n\nThe reported memo also included a section headlined the \"Unaccompanied Alien Children Joint Initiative Field Implementation,\" which outlines initiatives to ensure children are not victims of human trafficking or other forms of exploitation.\n\nTwo days ago, the Trump administration walked back an order to cut legal services for unaccompanied migrant children .\n\nIn a memo obtained by CNN on Friday, the Department of Interior said legal service providers \"may resume\" their work. It did not provide an explanation for the policy reversal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's National Security Adviser Michael Waltz said having Ukraine become a NATO member is not on the table.\n\n\"That is not back on the table. I do not see the United States having Ukraine enter into NATO,\" Waltz told Fox News on Monday.\n\n\"We are absolutely committed to NATO at large, our Article Five treaty agreements with other NATO countries, but the security guarantees for Ukraine is a different conversation,\" Waltz continued.\n\nWaltz comment comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that he was \"ready\" to resign as leader if it meant it would bring peace to his country, suggesting he could swap it for NATO membership.\n\nPresident Donald Trump thanked Apple CEO Tim Cook after the company announced Monday it will invest $500 billion on expanding US facilities over the next four years.\n\n\"Apple has just announced a record 500 billion dollar investment in the United States of America,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post Monday morning.\n\nTrump was quick to attribute the massive investment to confidence in his own policies, stating in all caps, \"The reason, faith in what we are doing, without which, they wouldn't be investing ten cents.\" Trump concluded his post by thanking Cook, who met with the president at the White House last week.\n\nRemember : Apple said Monday it would invest $500 billion on expanding US facilities over the next four years, a move that could help it avoid new tariffs on goods imported from China. The company said the investment will create 20,000 jobs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House today, on the third year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This comes as European leaders are rushing to the White House to try to reclaim a central role for themselves and for Ukraine after they were cut out of US-Russia talks on ending the war.\n\nLater on Monday, the deadline will expire for federal workers who received an email from the Department of Government Efficiency asking them to respond detailing what work they completed in the past week. Musk said on X that \"failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\"\n\nThe leaders of Europe's two nuclear powers are rushing to the White House to try to reclaim a central role for themselves and for Ukraine after they were cut out of US-Russia talks on ending the war.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron will visit Donald Trump today - the third anniversary of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign democracy, which has killed tens of thousands of civilians and left Putin and his forces accused of war crimes.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer follows on Thursday, as large gaps open between Washington and London on Ukraine's plight.\n\nBritain and France are drawing up plans for a European \"reassurance force,\" perhaps including up to 30,000 troops that could deploy to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. But the idea faces massive barriers - not least that a deal that both Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin could agree to sign seems highly unlikely.\n\nAnd Starmer has already warned that the force couldn't work without a US \"backstop,\" which could potentially include security guarantees, intelligence cooperation, air support and heavy lift transport. A key takeaway this week will be whether Trump has any interest, given Russia's opposition to NATO troops in Ukraine under any flag.\n\nAs Trump leads the US in a new direction on Ukraine, historic schisms are opening that threaten the transatlantic alliance and the post-World War II order. Trump treats America's longtime friends - who have failed to deliver on calls by successive presidents to spend more on defense - as adversaries. And the new administration has already shattered years of European assumptions about America's security guarantees to the West.\n\nRead the full analysis.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is pushing back against US demands for Ukraine's critical minerals and other natural resources as part of negotiations to end the war.\n\nDonald Trump has demanded a $500 billion share of Ukraine's deposits of rare earths and other minerals as part of a draft \"deal\" that the president said would reflect the amount of aid the US has provided to Ukraine during its war with Russia.\n\n\"I am not going to recognize $500 (billion),\" Zelensky said Sunday at a forum marking the third anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDrawing on Ukraine's resources to pay back the sum could take 250 years, Zelensky said, adding that he could not sign anything that \"ten generations of Ukrainians\" would have to pay back.\n\nUkraine has been pushing for US security guarantees to be part of any deal involving its mineral wealth.\n\nZelensky also said he was \"ready\" to resign as leader if it meant it would bring to his country, suggesting he could swap it for NATO membership\n\nEarlier this month, US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that Kyiv joining NATO was unrealistic, upending the alliance's stated policy that Ukraine was on an \"irreversible path\" to membership.\n\nAs part of an ongoing public spat, Trump has called Zelensky a \"dictator\" for not holding elections while Ukraine remains at war.\n\nUkraine has been under martial law since Russia launched its unprovoked invasion three years ago. The martial law prohibits elections.\n\nThe Trump administration's mass email asking federal employees what they worked on last week - and Elon Musk's announcement that anyone who does not respond will be dismissed - has sent agencies scrambling.\n\nSome agencies advised workers to hold off on responding, setting up a showdown with Musk. But other agencies are telling employees to comply, as unions vow legal challenges .\n\nWould dismissal be legal? Musk can't legally force federal employees to resign, and attempting to do so would amount to an involuntary termination, Michael Fallings, a federal employment law expert, told CNN. If workers were affected, they could file a claim challenging the action. Employees should discuss the email with their managers and, if applicable, their union officials before responding, Fallings said.\n\nHere's what officials are telling their workers:\n\nLeaders at the Pentagon , Federal Bureau of Investigation , State Department , Department of Homeland Security and Department of Energy all instructed their staff not to reply to an email that federal workers received from the Office of Personnel Management on Saturday afternoon.\n\nMultiple senior Defense Department officials told CNN the email thrust their weekend into chaos.\n\n\"It is the silliest thing I've seen in 40 years and completely usurps the chain of command,\" one official said. \"That might be done elsewhere, but in the DoD it's not done.\"\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services: HHS initially told employees to comply. But the agency later reversed its guidance, telling employees to \"pause\" their answering of the email.\n\nEmployees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , National Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration , which are part of HHS, were told by individual agencies to wait until Monday for more guidance.\n\nNASA is working to issue guidance on how employees should respond, after initially asking workers to comply.\n\nWorkers at the Social Security Administration and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were told to comply.\n\nMany employees at the CFPB, which the Trump administration is hoping to dismantle, were told to stop working earlier this month. The Sunday email said: \"If you were not able to perform tasks/work... you may reply and simply reference that you were complying with the current work stoppage.\"\n\nEmployees from the National Transportation Safety Board - tasked with investigating an unprecedented string of air disasters over the last month - have also been asked to justify what they did on the job last week. It's not clear how the NTSB staff will be directed to respond. The deadline to respond is 11:59 p.m. EST on Monday.\n\nRead more about how agencies are responding.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "March 20, 2025: Donald Trump presidency news\n\n• Dismantling key agency: President Donald Trump signed an executive order to begin dismantling the Education Department , seeking to fulfill decades of conservative ambition to shut the agency, but raising questions for public schools and parents. The agency will continue to oversee \"critical functions\" such as student loans, the White House said.\n\n• Mineral production order: Trump also signed an executive order aimed at increasing US production of critical minerals, including uranium, copper, potash, and gold, by invoking the Defense Production Act , with a push to expand leasing and development on federal lands.\n\n• DOJ deportation case: A federal judge said the Justice Department's response to his order to provide information on deportations of mostly Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador is \"woefully insufficient.\"\n\nOur live coverage of Donald Trump's presidency has ended for the day. Follow the latest updates or read through the posts below.\n\nGOP Rep. Harriet Hageman of Wyoming was questioned by a voter tonight about the Trump administration's claims of fraud in government spending during a tense exchange that follows the lawmaker's town hall with a hostile crowd yesterday.\n\n\"You are a lawyer, where is this fraud?\" the voter, who identified herself as a veteran and Republican, asked Hageman, according to CSPAN video of the town hall. The voter added: \"What company, what organization, what personnel are we going after?\"\n\nHageman pointed to spending by the US Agency for International Development as the fraud. The Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency are attempting to dismantle USAID.\n\n\"This is what it is. This is the spending associated with the fraud. This is the fraud, spending is the fraud,\" Hageman asserted.\n\nThe constituent and other attendees were not satisfied with Hageman's answer and repeatedly interrupted her as she attempted to cite numbers.\n\nHageman faced a similarly angry town hall crowd yesterday as she attempted to answer questions while voters shouted \"January 6\" and \"tax the rich.\"\n\nElon Musk will visit the Pentagon on Friday , the Defense Department said.\n\n\"The Defense Department is excited to welcome Elon Musk to the Pentagon on Friday. He was invited by Secretary Hegseth and is just visiting,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell told CNN.\n\nThe New York Times reported Thursday that Musk would be briefed on the US military's top-secret plan for any war that might break out with China.\n\nThe visit comes as the Pentagon, encouraged by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, considers major cuts to the top of the military as part of Trump's push to shrink the federal government.\n\nHegseth's recent strategic guidance memo, sent to Pentagon leaders this month and reviewed by CNN, directed a shift in focus and resources towards a possible conflict with China but offered few details as to what that would look like.\n\nSome background: Multiple versions of US military war plans are often prepared at varying levels of classification, according to sources. At the highest level, military operational plans contain so-called \"code word\" clearance information that involves sensitive sources and methods, such as the use of human and technical assets. Less sensitive versions of briefings are also frequently prepared that do not include highly classified information.\n\nIt is unclear which version would be presented to Musk.\n\nMusk has a top-secret security clearance and is serving in the Trump administration as a special government employee . But even individuals with security clearances still require a \"need to know\" before accessing particular information, according to the US government's classified handling procedures.\n\nMusk maintains lucrative contracts with the Defense Department. Last year, the US Space Force awarded $733 million in launch contracts to Musk's SpaceX.\n\nCNN's Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota on Thursday criticized the Democratic Party for being \"obsessed\" with its messaging and not doing enough for working people.\n\nDuring a lengthy, but friendly, town hall where she largely received praise - unlike lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who have had contentious exchanges with constituents in recent weeks - Omar fielded questions about the future of the Democratic party and how voters can trust Democrats.\n\n\"We have been obsessed with figuring out the perfect message and not doing the perfect thing on behalf of working people,\" Omar said, in response to a constituent who criticized the party for not seeming to \"have a grasp on how they should counter Trump.\" \"We often times as Democrats find our little siloed groups and we - we attack each other on why we can't be perfect. And that is problematic. The Republicans used to have that problem, and they figured out that 'Once we have power, we can fight about who gets to win.' Right? And we haven't figured that out. In 2020 we did,\" Omar said, referring to when Democrats won the White House and a narrow majority in both chambers of Congress.\n\nOmar went on to reassure a voter who asked, \"Why should we place their faith in a party that appears idle, uninspired and painfully weak?\"\n\n\"I do believe that Democrats are taking a hard look and themselves and what they stand for. But we are only as strong as you are willing to make us,\" the progressive congresswoman said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order today aimed at immediately increasing US production of critical minerals like uranium, copper, potash and gold by invoking the Defense Production Act , with a push to expand leasing and development on federal lands.\n\nThe order gives Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in consultation with other executive branch agency heads, the authority to use the Defense Production Act to facilitate the advancement of domestic mineral production. The act, which was passed in 1950 in response to production needs during the Korean War, gives the government more control during emergencies to direct industrial production. Trump invoked it in 2020 at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe executive order also directs relevant department and agency heads, in coordination with the Chair of the National Energy Dominance Council, to identify and expedite priority mineral production projects that can be \"immediately approved\" or immediately issued permits.\n\n\"It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent,\" the order states.\n\nWithin 10 days, Trump will call for Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to provide a list of all federal lands \"known to hold mineral deposits and reserves\" and \"prioritize mineral production and mining related purposes as the primary land uses in these areas, consistent with applicable law.\"\n\nThe order also asks the heads of the Interior, Defense, Agriculture and Energy departments to identify \"as many sites as possible\" where the construction and operation of private mineral production could take place on federal lands.\n\nCNN's Ella Nilsen contributed reporting.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon said today that dismantling the department \"certainly has some hurdles,\" given it would require an act of Congress, but she emphasized her goal is to work with them as \"a partner.\"\n\n\"What I'm going to be working to do is to work in conjunction with Congress,\" she told Fox News after President Donald Trump earlier Thursday signed an executive order to begin the process of dismantling the department.\n\n\"I think if we can show them that the best plan is to have states in control of education, for their communities, for their students, for their teachers, for their parents, that is the best thing, because the president believes, as do I, that the best education is closest to the, you know, closest to the student,\" McMahon said.\n\nShe said giving education funding to individual states to then give directly to parents or the students is worth exploring.\n\nAsked to respond to claims from American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, who argued on CNN that the administration was considering funneling money from students in need into blocking grants that would favor private school students, McMahon said they weren't taking education away from children.\n\n\"Clearly that's not what we're going to do. We want to make education better for children,\" McMahon said. \"The president is an absolute proponent of school choice, and we are going to work very hard to make sure that children are not held prisoner in failing schools.\"\n\nIn a gaggle after her Fox News hit, McMahon said staff cuts at the department were done \"thoughtfully.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is taking the first steps to fulfilling his campaign promise to dismantle the Department of Education.\n\nHe signed an executive order today to begin that process. But, getting rid of the Department of Education entirely would require an act of Congress.\n\nSome lawmakers are not happy with the move:\n\nBut others support the president's plan as it becomes a congressional debate:\n\nCNN's Tami Luhby contributed reporting to this post.\n\nA federal judge said the Trump administration cannot deport Badar Khan Suri - a Georgetown fellow and Indian national who was in the US on a visa.\n\nThe new order from US District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said that while she reviews a petition for Khan Suri in court challenging his detention, the administration is not to remove him from the country unless she issues another ruling to the contrary.\n\nKhan Suri's petition, filed earlier this week, alleged that the Trump administration was engaged in a \"targeted, retaliatory\" detention and attempted removal of him, and that he was targeted because his wife's Palestinian identity .\n\nKhan Suri and his wife, Mapheze Saleh, have three children, and she is an American citizen, according to the filing. His petition tied his detention to a broader effort by the Trump administration to allegedly revoke the visas of individuals \"purportedly based on their participation in Palestine-related speech.\" Such an approach is unconstitutional, his lawyers allege.\n\nThe union that represents employees of the Department of Education said it \"is outraged\" over  President Donald Trump's efforts to begin dismantling the agency.\n\nTrump today signed an executive order directing the secretary of education to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities.\"\n\nHere's what that union and other advocates are saying:\n\nCNN's Tami Luhby, Brian Todd and Dan Berman contributed reporting to this post, which has been updated with more reactions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive action today that begins the dismantling process of the Department of Education.\n\nWhile signing the action, Trump was surrounded by young children sitting at their own desks in the White House who simultaneously signed papers in a folder. Upon finishing signing them, the children could be seen holding up their actions as the president did.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday spoke about beginning to dismantle the Department of Education, telling Education Secretary Linda McMahon that she's \"presiding over something that's so important\" and that when she's done with the process, he will find \"something else\" for her.\n\n\"You're going to do a fantastic job,\" he said. \"Hopefully, you won't be there for too long. But we're going to find something else for you, Linda.\"\n\nAfter Trump signed an executive action that begins the dismantling process, McMahon released a statement saying it sends \"education back to the states w﻿here it so rightly belongs.\"\n\n\"Education is fundamentally a state responsibility. Instead of filtering resources through layers of federal red tape, we will empower states to take charge and advocate for and implement what is best for students, families, and educators in their communities,\" McMahon's statement read.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said today that some critical Department of Education programs will still exist even though he is taking the first steps to dismantle the department.\n\nThe Education Department is responsible for administering federal funding for students with disabilities, who fall under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, along with Title I funding for low-income schools and federal student loan payments like Pell Grants.\n\nTrump, shortly before signing the executive order aimed at dismantling the department, said Pell Grants, Title I funding and money for students with disabilities will be \"fully preserved.\"\n\n\"They're going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them,\" Trump said.\n\nSome background: Hours before Trump's signing ceremony, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Department of Education would continue to oversee federal Pell Grants and student loans, along with enforcing civil rights laws and funding for special education.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is speaking from the White House before he's expected to sign an executive order aimed at beginning the process to dismantle the Department of Education.\n\nRemember: Getting rid of the Department of Education entirely would require an act of Congress. One administration official said earlier today the president will direct Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take \"all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the states.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday he would be signing a deal \"very shortly\" on rare earth minerals with Ukraine.\n\n\"We're doing very well with regard to Ukraine and Russia. And one of the things we are doing is signing a deal very shortly with respect to rare earths with Ukraine, which they have tremendous value in rare earth,\" Trump said off the top of an event where he signed an executive order to begin dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nThis deal was what brought Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House last month, but it was never ultimately signed after a tense Oval Office meeting between him and Trump and Vice President JD Vance.\n\nProjecting optimism about reaching an end to the war, Trump referenced recent phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky.\n\n\"We spoke yesterday with, as you know, President Putin and President Zelensky, and we would love to see that come to an end, and I think we're doing pretty well in that regard,\" he said. \"I believe we'll get it done. We'll see what happens.\"\n\nTrump spoke with Putin on Tuesday and Zelensky on Wednesday.\n\nAt a press briefing on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the White House had \"moved beyond the economic minerals deal.\"\n\n\"We are at a place of peace. We're at a partial ceasefire, and we're moving towards a full cease fire and a long standing peace in this conflict,\" Leavitt continued.\n\nLater asked what moving beyond meant, Leavitt said: \"It means the minerals deal was that first set of framework that you all saw in that very public meeting with President Zelensky and President Trump in the Oval Office. We are now focused on a long term peace agreement.\"\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg chastised the Justice Department on Thursday, saying it did not obey his order to turn over information about deportations the Trump administration carried out last weekend.\n\nHis response is the latest in a back-and-forth between the judge and DOJ, which has brought questions about whether the Trump administration would be willing to blatantly defy a court order. It's also resulted in a call from President Donald Trump that Boasberg be impeached and a rare rebuke of the president from Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nBoasberg had ordered the administration to turn over the information by noon ET Thursday or invoke the \"state-secrets privilege\" in its bid to avoiding provide the information. But in a brief order Thursday afternoon, the judge said the department had instead submitted a sealed filing \"shortly after\" the deadline where it \"evaded its obligations.\"\n\nThe DOJ filing, Boasberg wrote, included a sworn statement from an official with the ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations who \"repeated the same general information about the flights\" and went on to say that Cabinet secretaries are \"'are currently actively considering whether to invoke the state secrets privilege over the other facts requested by the Court's order.'\"\n\n\"This is woefully insufficient,\" Boasberg wrote. \"The Government cannot proffer a regional ICE official to attest to Cabinet-level discussions of the state-secrets privilege; indeed, his declaration on that point, not surprisingly, is based solely on his unsubstantiated 'understand[ing].'\"\n\nBoasberg, the chief judge of the federal trial-level court in Washington, DC, said he was ordering the Justice Department to \"show cause\" as to how two deportation flights it allowed to continue last Saturday did not violate orders he issued that day temporarily blocking the administration's ability to remove individuals under the Alien Enemies Act . The judge had ordered all planes carrying migrants being deported under the act to turn around immediately.\n\nA federal judge on Thursday blocked the Social Security Administration from giving members of the Department of Government Efficiency access to agency data containing individuals' personally identifiable information.\n\nThe new temporary restraining order from US District Judge Ellen Hollander also requires DOGE affiliates to delete any personally identifiable information data they've acquired from the agency. She also ordered them to remove any software they've installed in the agency's systems.\n\nHer order, however, allows the DOGE affiliates to access Social Security data that is redacted or anonymized - but only if those DOGE representatives receive proper training and are subject to a background check.\n\n\"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion,\" Hollander wrote. \"It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack.\"\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi announced charges against three people Thursday for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla properties as part of a nationwide Trump administration effort to arrest people accused of violence against the company.\n\nPeople in Oregon, Colorado and South Carolina allegedly attacked Tesla cars and charging stations, the department said, adding that one of the defendants was armed with a suppressed AR-15 when he was arrested.\n\n\"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars,\" Bondi said in a statement.\n\nThe Justice Department did not name the defendants, who could each face up to 30 years in prison.\n\nPolice across the United States are have been investigating repeated acts of vandalism and attacks, CNN has reported , including gunshots fired at a Tesla showroom. Law enforcement officials have claimed that the attacks are an effort to target CEO Elon Musk for his political affiliation.\n\nThe department and the FBI have charged at least four people with federal crimes related to the attacks. Bondi has said investigators are looking into whether there is evidence that the attacks are coordinated.\n\nWatch CNN's Laura Coates explain more about the charges:\n\nCNN's Laura Coates explains if the Department of Justice can charge Tesla vandals with terrorism after President Donald Trump's administration tries to expand the definition of domestic terrorism as it aims to crack down on a wave of attacks in which Teslas have been shot at and set on fire, to protest CEO Elon Musk's powerful but murky role in cutting the US government. #CNN #News #Tesla #ElonMusk #Trump\n\nThe 2026 midterms are more than a year and a half away, but Democrats across the country are blitzing digital platforms with fundraising ads spotlighting Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency's steep cuts to the federal government.\n\nIt reflects an emerging strategic consensus among Democratic campaigns, which have in near-unison seized on the tech billionaire as they seek to rebuild amid unified GOP control of government.\n\nHere are some of the candidates and groups who put out ads:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order today to start the process of dismantling the Department of Education . During his presidential campaign, he said he wanted to close the agency and send \"all education and education work and needs back to the states.\"\n\nHere's a look at how the Department of Education was created and what it does:\n\n• How it was created: In 1979, then-President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat from Georgia, signed legislation making the Department of Education a Cabinet-level agency - fulfilling a campaign pledge he made to one of the country's largest teachers' unions, the National Education Association. Previously, federal education programs were housed in other agencies.\n\n• Funneling money to states and schools: Some of the Department of Education's biggest jobs are to administer federal funding appropriated by Congress to K-12 schools and manage the federal student loan and financial aid programs. Two of the biggest funding programs for K-12 schools are the Title I program , which is meant to help educate children from low-income families, and the IDEA program , which provides schools with money to help meet the needs of children with disabilities. The Department of Education also distributes about $30 billion a year to low-income college students via the Pell grant program and manages the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio.\n\n• Conducting oversight and making regulations: The Department of Education also has an oversight role and engages in federal rulemaking. Its Office of Civil Rights , for example, is tasked with investigating alleged discrimination complaints at colleges and K-12 schools, which increased significantly after the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel last October. The office had seven of its 12 regional offices shuttered and nearly half of its staff laid off earlier this month. The department can also create federal regulations. Some of the agency's rules have recently touched on issues at play in the culture wars that seeped into local politics during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n• Past efforts to abolish the department: Then- President Ronald Reagan , a Republican, called for eliminating the agency just one year after it started operating in 1980 - but backed off when there appeared to be little support in Congress . During Trump's first term as president, his administration proposed merging the Education and Labor departments into one federal agency. Even though Republicans controlled both the Senate and House of Representatives at the time, the proposal did not go anywhere.\n\nWith reporting from Katie Lobosco, Jeff Zeleny, Sunlen Serfaty and Betsy Klein.\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest person and a close ally of President Donald Trump, made political contributions this week to several Republican lawmakers who support impeaching judges who are blocking the Trump administration's agenda, according to a person familiar with the giving.\n\nMusk has repeatedly called for removing judges on his social media platform, X.\n\nThe contributions went to the campaigns of Reps. Eli Crane, Lauren Boebert, Andy Ogles, Andrew Clyde, Derrick Van Orden and Brandon Gill. Musk also donated to Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nGrassley has not called for judicial impeachments but harshly criticized an order by US District Judge James Boasberg that the government temporarily halt deporting individuals while he weighed a legal challenge to Trump use of the Alien Enemies Act in removing migrants. Grassley also has pledged action from his committee.\n\nThe New York Times first reported the contributions.\n\nGOP Sen. Jim Justice told reporters in the Capitol on Thursday \"it wouldn't be fair\" to say that Republicans would never cut Medicaid benefits as they work to enact their legislative agenda, even as he argued they want to avoid that at all costs.\n\n\"I think it wouldn't be fair to say, 'Justice would say, never ever cut benefits,'\" he said. \"That wouldn't be fair for me to say to you at all, because I really believe that from a - benefits aside, you know, none of us want to cut benefits, and nobody here, and I promise you to God above, there's no way that President Trump is going to do anything that's going to hurt our seniors, I mean, there's no way, or hurt our kids. I don't buy it.\"\n\nHe continued, \"But at the end of ... this whole process, should we not look at methodologies - that maybe some person, people would call a cut - that would make it just better for everybody, you know? So, I think there's a lot, there's a lot, lot of work we got to do.\"\n\nRepublicans have not yet specified exactly what cuts they would make in an effort to pass a major legislative package on a party line vote in Congress through a process known as reconciliation. But given the size of the cuts that the GOP is targeting, Democrats have warned that it is likely Medicaid cuts would be on the table. Republican leaders have said there won't be cuts to benefits, but that they will go after waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nThe noon deadline today has passed for the Justice Department to respond to Judge James Boasberg's order , and we have not seen a public filing in the court case concerning the Trump administration's deportations of migrants to El Salvador.\n\nThat doesn't mean, however, that the Trump administration has ignored the judge.\n\nCNN has reached out to spokespeople for the Justice Department on whether its has submitted a filing to comply with the judge's order that may not be on the public docket.\n\nWhat we know so far: The judge previously ordered the Justice Department answer questions he had about flight details for the deportations carried out Saturday night, and said that filing should be made under seal. Filings in the federal court in Washington that are submitted under seal are not always accompanied by a public notice that they have been submitted.\n\nBoasberg also gave the DOJ the option to refrain from giving details and providing him a justification for their secrecy under state secrets protections or a classified filing. That also may be submitted to the court without a public notification, under court rules.\n\nThe proceedings are worth watching for the possibility that the Trump administration escalates again its legal standoff with Boasberg. The administration has repeatedly argued he should not have power over the president's deportation decisions, and have attacked him publicly in interviews and other remarks. But it has not baldly defied a simple order, as far as CNN can confirm, at this time.\n\nCNN's Hannah Rabinowitz contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThe Department of Education has struggled to find a viable alternative agency to manage its massive student debt portfolio, according to two sources involved in the discussions.\n\nThe loan portfolio totals a staggering $1.8 trillion in debt, with an estimated 40% of loans past due, the sources said, up from what CNN has previously reported based on publicly available information.\n\nThe White House announced Thursday that the portfolio would remain with the Department of Education as President Donald Trump is expected to start the process of dismantling the agency. Trump had previously suggested that the portfolio - which is larger than all but three US banks - would be transferred to the Treasury Department or Small Business Administration, but those plans have not taken shape.\n\n\"Treasury doesn't want it,\" according to one of the sources involved in the discussions, who also told CNN no conversations about moving it to the Small Business Administration had advanced.\n\nPhillip Juengst, a longtime career official at the department who is serving as deputy chief operating officer for Federal Student Aid, had previously told staffers that a plan for Treasury to take on collection efforts for the defaulted loans was a \"cautious go.\" But days later, Juengst told staffers that plan was no longer viable, the source said.\n\nWeeks ago, Trump himself acknowledged that finding a home for the loans was among the more complicated factors of dismantling the agency.\n\nIn the meantime, companies that service student loans have been provided no guidance on how they could be impacted, according to a trade organization.\n\n\"Student loans are statutory entitlement programs that have to be supported,\" Scott Buchanan, the executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, said. \"So, I don't expect any immediate impact to borrower experience of potential structural changes to Ed.\"\n\nThe Department of Education will continue to oversee federal Pell grants and student loans, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at the White House Thursday, as the Trump administration seeks to dismantle the department and shift control of education to the states.\n\n\"When it comes to student loans and Pell grants, those will still be run out of the Department of Education, but we don't need to be spending more than $3 trillion over the course of a few decades on a department that's clearly failing in its initial intention to educate our students,\" she said.\n\nLeavitt described President Donald Trump's upcoming executive action on the Education Department as a move to \"greatly minimize the agency.\"\n\nPressed on whether enforcement of civil rights laws will be handled out of the minimized department, Leavitt said, \"Any critical functions of the department such as that will remain, but again, we're greatly reducing the scale and the size of this department.\"\n\nAnd asked about the future of federal Title I funding and special education, she said, \"Same answer.\"\n\n\"It means stopping the wasteful spending, and as I said, critical programs will be protected,\" she said of Thursday's executive action.\n\nRemember: Dismantling the Department of Education entirely would require an act of Congress. Leavitt didn't say whether Trump is pushing for that move.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he did not discuss the ownership of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant with his US counterpart Donald Trump, disputing a claim made by the White House .\n\nAfter Trump held what he called a \"very good\" phone call with Zelensky on Wednesday, the White House said the US president had brought up Ukraine's nuclear power plants and told Zelensky that \"American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\"\n\nBut speaking at a news conference in Norway on Thursday, Zelensky denied that he had discussed US ownership of Ukraine's nuclear power plants.\n\n\"In terms of ownership, we definitely did not discuss this with President Trump,\" Zelensky said.\n\nAsked about the ZNPP, which is currently occupied by Russian troops, Zelensky stressed that \"all nuclear power belongs to the (Ukrainian) state, including the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhia region.\"\n\nPrivate companies own other parts of Ukraine's energy sector, such as thermal power plants, but Zelensky said nuclear plants must remain under the state's control.\n\n\"I said if it isn't Ukrainian, it won't work for anyone,\" he added.\n\nZNPP has been under Russian control since March 2022 , but is operated mostly by Ukrainian staff who were initially forced to work at gunpoint, according to Ukrainian officials.\n\n\"The personnel working there now are the personnel who have been paid by the state of Ukraine and they are citizens of Ukraine. Yes, their management changed,\" Zelensky said, referring to the Russians overseeing the plant's staff.\n\nZelensky also told reporters that he and Trump did not discuss the issue of Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nThe European Union is delaying the retaliatory tariffs it announced after the United States imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports earlier this month.\n\nThe countermeasures, which include higher tariffs on American whiskey, are now set to take effect in mid-April instead, pending negotiations, the commission announced on Thursday.\n\nAs President Donald Trump pushes ahead with a crackdown on immigration, his agenda faces legal hurdles and tests diplomatic relations.\n\nHere's the latest on the crackdown:\n\nAlien Enemies Act deportations draw backlash:\n\nAnother academic is detained:\n\nThe Republican chairs of the House and Senate Armed Services committee said in a statement Wednesday that Congress must be involved in any reorganization at the Pentagon, as the Department of Defense weighs major cuts to the top of the US military.\n\n\"We will not accept significant changes to our warfighting structure that are made without a rigorous interagency process, coordination with combatant commanders and the Joint Staff, and collaboration with Congress,\" Sen. Roger Wicker and Rep. Mike Rogers wrote in a statement.\n\nSome background: As CNN has reported , the Pentagon is considering consolidating combatant commands, possibly eliminating a directorate that oversees development, training and education for the joint force, and halting the expansion of US Forces Japan.\n\nThe plans under consideration also include merging European Command and Africa Command into a single command based in Stuttgart, Germany, and combining US Northern and Southern commands into a single Americom command, according to a briefing document obtained by CNN.\n\nThe Trump administration is pinning blame for escalating violence in the Middle East squarely on Hamas, saying in a statement that it \"chose war\" and bears \"total responsibility\" as Israel relaunched a ground offensive in Gaza this week.\n\n\"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose war. These terrorists bear total responsibility for this conflict and the resumption of hostilities,\" National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt said in a statement to CNN.\n\nIn Gaza: Hamas on Thursday fired rockets at Israel from Gaza , marking the militant group's first response to Israel's renewed offensive in the strip that ended a two-month-old ceasefire. Israel blames the new fighting on Hamas for refusing to accept revised ceasefire terms. Hamas, in turn, has accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of unilaterally upending the truce and putting hostages \"at risk of an unknown fate.\" Gaza's health ministry said more than 400 people were killed in Tuesday's airstrikes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed support for Israel's recent actions, warning Hamas in a statement earlier this month to release the hostages still held in Gaza. The Trump administration was consulted by Israel ahead of its attack on Gaza earlier this week, according to press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\n\"Every death would have and could have been avoided had Hamas accepted the 'bridge' proposal special envoy (Steve) Witkoff offered last week,\" Hewitt said Thursday, echoing previous comments from a State Department spokesperson.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering a request from Chevron to extend the oil giant's license to pump oil in Venezuela, according to an industry source.\n\nSuch a move would reverse President Donald Trump's previous decision to order Chevron to wind down exports and operations in oil-rich Venezuela by April 3.\n\nDuring a meeting with oil industry executives on Wednesday, Trump expressed openness to considering Chevron's request to extend the Venezuela license , the source told CNN.\n\nChevron CEO Mike Wirth requested the extension during meetings with top US officials, citing concerns that large-scale operations can't be moved overnight and that a hasty exit could open an opportunity for China or other actors to step in, the source said.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on the news, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal .\n\nChevron spokesperson Laura Hurst declined to comment on discussions with US officials, but said the company \"regularly\" meets with government officials to discuss business-related issues at home and abroad.\n\n\"Chevron conducts its business globally in compliance with all laws and regulations, including any sanctions frameworks provided by the US government,\" Hurst said.\n\nSome background: In February, Trump said in a social media post that he would terminate the Venezuela oil permit due to unmet electoral conditions by authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro and dissatisfaction over the pace of deportations of Venezuelan immigrants.\n\nThe oil permit, authorized by former President Joe Biden's administration in 2022, has been a financial lifeline for Venezuela and a way for Chevron to recoup money invested in the nation over decades of doing business there.\n\nTalks between Russia and the United States will be held Monday in Saudi Arabia, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said Thursday, according to Russian state media.\n\nUshakov said he and US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz agreed that the next round of US-Russia talks will take place on March 24 in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.\n\nUshakov added that he and Waltz \"communicate regularly by telephone\" and that they last spoke on Wednesday.\n\nA White House official confirmed to CNN that the meeting between the technical teams will take place in Riyadh on Monday.\n\nAs CNN previously reported , those meetings are designed for US and Russian officials to hammer out more specific language on the deal reached by Trump and Putin, as well as other areas of negotiation, including broadening the agreement to the Black Sea on the way to a full ceasefire. The talks won't involve top US Cabinet-level officials, the State Department said Wednesday.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information.\n\nVoters have expressed their frustrations in several town halls across the country in recent days as they publicly vocalize their dissatisfaction with those in office. Constituents have criticized Republican members of Congress about President Donald Trump's executive power and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency efforts, while some Democratic members have faced complaints of being disorganized and not fighting Trump hard enough.\n\nGOP Rep. Harriet Hageman is one of those lawmakers. She faced a hostile crowd at a town hall in Laramie, Wyoming, on Wednesday, where she attempted to drown out the noise and answer questions.\n\nRead CNN's story on the town halls and watch scenes from Hageman's town hall below:\n\nWyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman faced a hostile crowd at a town hall in Laramie, Wyoming, The Republican lawmaker was repeatedly interrupted by the agitated crowd while answering questions on the Trump administration, DOGE cuts, deportations and more. #cnn #news #politics\n\nThe US military is deploying a second warship to areas near the US southern border, with an announcement about the deployment expected by the end of this week, a US official told CNN.\n\nThe Naval destroyer will join the USS Gravely, which was deployed by US Northern Command to the border area last weekend.\n\nWhy this matters: It is highly unusual for two US warships to be deployed at once to the southern border and underscores the emphasis the Trump administration is placing on demonstrating that it is building up a military presence there.\n\nThe Gravely, a heavily armed vessel designed to intercept ballistic missiles, played a key role in combating Houthi attacks in the Red Sea but will now be focused on patrolling the waters off of the US and Mexico and facilitating drug interdictions by the Coast Guard, which will have a detachment on board the ship.\n\nThe Coast Guard appeared to prematurely announce the deployment of the second warship on Tuesday, when it said in a statement that US Northern Command \"deployed two U.S. Navy warships to the southern border to support Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Coast Guard operations.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged as central bank officials weigh the impact of President Donald Trump's aggressive economic agenda.\n\nAnalyzing the \"net effect\": Trump's tariffs threaten higher inflation and weaker growth, his aggressive crackdown on immigration can cause labor shortages, and his mass layoffs of federal workers could send some local economies into a recession. But his deregulation efforts and the extension of his 2017 tax cuts could promote growth. It's unclear what the \"net effect\" of Trump's policies on the US economy will be, as measured by growth, inflation, and the labor market.\n\nTrump was not happy with the Fed's decision, saying it should have cut interest rates rather than holding firm.\n\n\"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to reciprocal tariffs he previously said he would impose on US trading partners next month.\n\nThis contradicted comments by National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who said the Trump administration respected the Fed's independence.\n\n\"We very much respect the independence of the Fed, and there's a mass of literature that independent central banks perform better for economies.\"\n\nSome context: Investors typically look askance at politicians interfering in interest rate decisions, preferring that central bankers take economic factors - and not changeable political winds or the pressures of upcoming elections - as the basis for their decisions.\n\nDespite the White House's repeated attacks on federal Judge James Boasberg, the Trump administration remains confident it will prevail in ongoing litigation about the president's use of executive power.\n\nEven before President Donald Trump retook office, his advisers expected that his executive orders and other policy moves would face immediate legal challenges. It was expected that those challenges would be filed in districts that were friendly to challengers and would result in initial losses for the administration.\n\nThat has been the case. Over 160 lawsuits have been filed against various administration policies, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wednesday on Fox News. They are often in jurisdictions with mostly or all Democratic-appointed judges such as Boston, Maryland, Seattle and Washington, DC, though that doesn't guarantee success for the plaintiffs.\n\nBut the Trump legal strategy has always been a long game designed to get these questions before the conservative supermajority at the Supreme Court where his lawyers believe Trump will prevail in his expansive use of executive power. A recent string of court losses has not deterred the administration from continuing to pursue this strategy.\n\nWhile the outcome of these cases can have immediate effects for the people at the center of each controversy, the Trump administration is playing a long game.\n\nThe Justice Department is also not going to change its approach despite a rare statement being issued by Chief Justice John Roberts condemning the president, without naming him, for suggesting a federal judge should be impeached. Administration officials believe that statement is about Trump's social media posts - not the merits of their legal arguments, according to a source.\n\nTrump responded to Roberts' rebuke in an interview with Fox News Tuesday evening, saying that the chief justice's comments were not directed at him and continued to attack Boasberg.\n\n\"Well, [Roberts] didn't mention my name in the statement, and I just saw it quickly,\" Trump said. \"He didn't mention my name - but many people have called for [Boasberg's] impeachment, the impeachment of this judge.\"\n\nKeep reading here to see how the Trump administration is handling legal challenges to its agenda .\n\nThe Justice Department faces a deadline to day to provide a federal judge with more information about deportations the Trump administration carried out last weekend under the Alien Enemies Act, or decide if it will invoke \"state-secrets privilege\" to avoid divulging the information.\n\nOn Saturday evening, US District Judge James Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations under the act - and verbally ordered any planes in the air carrying some of those migrants to turn back to the US. The Trump administration then announced Sunday that hundreds of mostly Venezuelan alleged gang members were deported from the United States to a prison in El Salvador. President Donald Trump defended his use of the act and the White House said the administration did not violate the judge's order because it was issued after the migrants in question had left the US.\n\nHere is the latest on the legal battle:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is poised to sign an executive order tomorrow to start the process of dismantling the Department of Education , administration officials told CNN, a move that will begin fulfilling a major campaign promise.\n\nThe president is set to make the move in an afternoon event at the White House.\n\nWhile entirely shuttering the Department of Education would require an act of Congress, the president will direct Secretary Linda McMahon to take \"all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the states,\" one of the administration official said.\n\nUSA Today was first to report the expected signing.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Donald Trump's criminal cases, in one place\n\nBy Amy O'Kruk and Curt Merrill, CNN\n\nUpdated January 10, 2025\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump will face no legal penalties for his conviction in the hush money case. Judge Juan Merchan upheld Trumpâs conviction in the case on January 3, 2025, rejecting the president-electâs effort to throw out the juryâs verdict because of his reelection in November. Merchan sentenced Trump to an unconditional discharge on January 10.\n\nPreviously, special counsel Jack Smith announced on November 25 that he was dropping both his election subversion case and the classified documents case against President-elect Donald Trump. While Smith is dropping his prosecution of Trump, he said that prosecutors would keep alive their case against two of his employees in the classified documents case.\n\nSince Trumpâs reelection, Smith had been in talks with Justice Department leadership about how to end both cases. Trump has said he would fire Smith once he retook the office, shattering previous norms around special counsel investigations.\n\nOn September 12, some charges in the Fulton County case were thrown out by the judge.\n\nCatch up on what you need to know about Trumpâs cases, including key evidence, charges and what could be next in the legal process.\n\nInvestigation\n\nIndictment\n\nArraignment\n\nTrial\n\nVerdict\n\nAppeals\n\nTrump was first indicted in March 2023 by the Manhattan district attorney on state charges related to a hush-money payment to an adult-film star in 2016. On May 30, 2024 he was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree by 12 jurors. Prosecutors alleged during the trial that Trump was a part of an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of the 2016 election. Further, they alleged he was part of an unlawful plan to suppress negative information, including the $130,000 payment. Trump pleaded not guilty .\n\nOn November 19, 2024, the Manhattan District Attorneyâs Office told Judge Juan Merchan it would agree to delay Trumpâs sentencing, which had been set for November 26, to allow time for the anticipated litigation around the president-electâs expected motion to dismiss the case. On November 22, Merchan indefinitely postponed the sentencing and granted Trumpâs request to file a motion to dismiss the case. On January 3, 2025, Merchan rejected Trump's effort to throw out the juryâs verdict because of his reelection in November and upheld the conviction. Merchan sentenced Trump to an unconditional discharge on January 10.\n\nInvestigation\n\nIndictment\n\nArraignment\n\nTrial\n\nVerdict\n\nAppeals\n\nTrump was indicted in June 2023 by a federal grand jury in Miami for taking classified national defense documents from the White House after he left office and resisting the governmentâs attempts to retrieve the materials. Both Trump and his aide Walt Nauta have pleaded not guilty .\n\nOn July 27, 2023, the special counsel charged Trump with three new counts , including one additional count of willful retention of national defense information. Nauta was also charged on two new counts. A third defendant, Carlos de Oliveira, was added to the case and charged with four counts, including being added to the obstruction conspiracy charged in the original indictment.\n\nUS District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case on July 15, 2024, saying in a ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith violated the Constitution.\n\nSmith announced on November 25, 2024, that he was dropping both his election subversion case and the classified documents case against President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nUse the arrows to see the full list of charges.\n\nInvestigation\n\nIndictment\n\nArraignment\n\nTrial\n\nVerdict\n\nAppeals\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith announced on November 25, 2024, that he was dropping both his election subversion case and the classified documents case against President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nSmith had filed a superseding indictment on August 27 in his investigation into alleged efforts by the former president and his allies to overturn the 2020 election. The new indictment slims down the allegations against the 2024 Republican presidential nominee in light of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, though none of the four charges have been dropped. In the reworked indictment , prosecutors argue several times that Trump didn't have any constitutionally assigned presidential duties regarding the post-election transition of power. In one instance, prosecutors pointed to the Electoral College certification proceedings that took place during a joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021. The criminal charges in part accuse Trump of illegally obstructing the certification proceeding. The Trump campaign has previously denied the allegations and Trump pleaded not guilty to all four counts .\n\nOn February 6, 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that Trump is not immune from prosecution for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results. On July 1, the Supreme Court rejected that decision , ruling that Trump can claim limited immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken in office â likely further delaying a trial in the case.\n\nOn Oct. 2, 2024, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., released a 165-page filing from Smith in which the special counsel argues that Trump acted to overturn the election in his private capacity as a candidate, rather than in his official capacity as a president. The document, which offers the fullest account of the special counsel's evidence, lays out the prosecution's case for a trial judge in a way that they believe would overcome the immunity protections around the presidency that the Supreme Court outlined.\n\nThe initial charging documents repeatedly reference six co-conspirators, but as is common practice, their identities were withheld because they have not been charged with any crimes. However, based on quotes in the indictment and other context, CNN can identify five of the six co-conspirators below.\n\nInvestigation\n\nIndictment\n\nArraignment\n\nTrial\n\nVerdict\n\nAppeals\n\nAn Atlanta-based grand jury on August 14, 2023, indicted Trump and 18 others on state charges stemming from their alleged efforts to overturn the former presidentâs 2020 electoral defeat. Four people have pleaded guilty.\n\nThe historic indictment is the fourth criminal case that Trump is facing. The charges, brought in a sweeping investigation led by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, cover some of the most overt efforts by the former president and his allies to meddle in the 2020 presidential election. Unlike the election subversion charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith, Willisâ case will be insulated if Trump is reelected in 2024; he will not be able to pardon himself or his allies of any state law convictions, nor will he be able to order the state-level prosecutors to withdraw the charges. Trump pleaded not guilty via court filing, waiving an in-court appearance as allowed by Georgia law.\n\nOn March 13, 2024, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee dismissed six of the 41 counts from the indictment, including three that applied to Trump. The partial dismissal does not mean that the entire indictment has been dismissed. McAfeeâs partial dismissal left most of the sprawling racketeering indictment intact.\n\nOn June 5, a Georgia appeals court indefinitely paused the case for Trump and some co-defendants until a panel of judges rules on whether Willis should be disqualified.\n\nOn September 12, some of the charges were thrown out by the judge.\n\nUse the arrows to see the full list of charges."

      "text": "Supreme Court rules Trump has limited immunity in January 6 case, jeopardizing trial before election\n\nFollow:\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Monday that Donald Trump may claim immunity from criminal prosecution for some of the actions he took in the waning days of his presidency in a decision that will likely further delay a trial on the federal election subversion charges pending against him.\n\nIn the most closely watched case before the Supreme Court this year, the ruling rejects a decision from a federal appeals court in February that found Trump enjoyed no immunity for alleged crimes he committed during his presidency to reverse the 2020 election results.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision was 6-3, with the court's liberals in dissent. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a lengthy and strongly worded dissent in which she excoriated the court for its decision.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote in Monday's opinion, \"We conclude that under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of presidential power requires that a former president have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office. At least with respect to the President's exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute.\"\n\n\"The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,\" Roberts also wrote.\n\nThe chief justice said the trial court will have to assess what of Trump's alleged conduct is immunized under the new test handed down by the high court, and the opinion said that additional briefing will be needed for the trial court to do so.\n\n\"We accordingly remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance - with the benefit of briefing we lack - whether Trump's conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial,\" wrote Roberts, who said there was a lack of \"factual analysis\" in the previous lower court opinions rejecting Trump's immunity.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett expressed frustration with how the court was sending the case back down for more proceedings.\n\n\"I would have framed the underlying legal issues differently,\" Barrett wrote in a concurrence. She suggested that because Trump's wholesale challenge to the indictment had failed, at least some of the case could go forward.\n\n\"A President facing prosecution may challenge the constitutionality of a criminal statute as applied to official acts alleged in the indictment,\" Barrett wrote.\n\n\"If that challenge fails, however, he must stand trial,\" she said.\n\nShe took issue with how the court had ruled that evidence from Trump's official acts should be excluded from the trial, writing that there was no reason to depart from the \"familiar and time-tested procedure\" that would allow for such evidence to be included.\n\nThe decision was quickly welcomed by Trump, who called it a \"BIG WIN FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND DEMOCRACY\" on Truth Social. His legal team says they believe it is possible that special counsel Jack Smith's case is now completely undermined because any communication Trump had with then-Vice President Mike Pence or Department of Justice officials could be considered official, precluding it from being introduced at trial.\n\nThe team also said it could even help Trump in the classified documents case, though the initial views do not necessarily mean that's how the legal process will ultimately play out.\n\nIn a call with the media following the court's ruling on Monday, the Biden campaign attacked the \"conflicted and compromised\" Supreme Court, accusing the justices of handing Trump \"the keys to a dictatorship.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court made clear that unofficial actions do not receive immunity, and Smith has long made clear that he feels he could continue the case based on those unofficial actions. In that sense, if Smith narrowed his indictment, lower courts could hear the Trump trial this year.\n\nBut the high court also left a lot of work for those lower courts to sort out what constitutes an official act versus a private one.\n\nPerhaps even more important, the majority made clear that official acts cannot be considered at all as evidence in a potential trial, which could make it much harder for Smith to demonstrate Trump's motive and other aspects of Smith's case against Trump. Roberts wrote that the lower courts may not look into a former president's motive.\n\n\"Certain allegations - such as those involving Trump's discussions with the Acting Attorney General - are readily categorized in light of the nature of the president's official relationship to the office held by that individual,\" Roberts wrote.\n\n\"Other allegations - such as those involving Trump's interactions with the vice president, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public - present more difficult questions,\" Roberts wrote.\n\nBut Roberts said it is lower courts that must decide whether those actions \"are subject to immunity, that analysis ultimately is best left to the lower courts to perform in the first instance.\"\n\nSotomayor, writing for the two other liberal justices, said the court's ruling \"makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law.\"\n\n\"When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority's reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy's Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n\n\"Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends. Because if he knew that he may one day face liability for breaking the law, he might not be as bold and fearless as we would like him to be. That is the majority's message today,\" Sotomayor also wrote. \"Even if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage has been done. The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.\"\n\n\"With fear for our democracy, I dissent,\" Sotomayor concluded.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and reaction.\n\nCNN's Paula Reid, Nikki Carvajal and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "NY judge says Trump will face no penalties in his criminal hush money case but upholds conviction\n\nFollow:\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump will face no legal penalties for his conviction in the hush money case, a New York judge ruled Friday.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan, however, upheld Trump's conviction in the case, rejecting the president-elect's effort to throw out the jury's verdict because of his reelection in November. This ensures that Trump will be the first convicted felon to become president.\n\nMerchan set sentencing for January 10, but indicated the case is essentially over. The court hearing will be held 10 days before Trump is inaugurated for a second term - a reminder of the prominence that his legal issues have played in his return to power in Washington.\n\nMerchan in his ruling referenced Trump's plans to appeal and said that imposing no penalty would bring \"finality\" to the case while allowing Trump to continue pursuing an appeal of the conviction. Such an appeal will lack urgency since Trump will face no punishment that risks interfering with his duties as president.\n\n\"A sentence of an unconditional discharge appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality and allow Defendant to pursue his appellate options,\" Merchan wrote.\n\nThe judge also said that he would allow Trump to appear to the sentencing virtually, to assuage the president elect's concerns about the \"mental and physical demands during this transition period.\"\n\n\"It was a smart move by Judge Merchan to announce in advance that he is going to impose no punishment, and hold the proceeding remotely, because that undermines any effort by Trump's team to argue in federal court that sentencing imposes some major burden,\" said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said.\n\nIn his ruling Friday, Merchan repeatedly referenced internal US Justice Department opinions - which are not binding in court, but has applied to the federal government's conduct - that say that a sitting president cannot be subject to prosecution. He said he considered the points made by the DOJ in those opinions and raised by Trump in his arguments to the New York court. and that he had found that those concerns did not justify putting off the sentence.\n\nTrump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records over payments to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse a $130,000 hush money payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, in order to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair before the 2016 election. (Trump has denied the affair.)\n\nTrump was scheduled to be sentenced in July, but that was postponed twice as a result of the Supreme Court's immunity ruling.\n\nTrump's lawyers initially pushed to dismiss Trump's conviction on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity, arguing that prosecutors' relied on evidence from Trump's official conduct in the White House. After the election, Trump's lawyers filed a new motion to dismiss the case, arguing that his status as president was a \"legal impediment\" to further criminal proceedings based on both the Supreme Court's presidential immunity doctrine and the Constitution's Supremacy Clause that federal law takes precedence over state law.\n\nLast month, Merchan said the conviction should not be tossed out because of the high court's July ruling. In that decision, Merchan said that the Supreme Court ruling that Trump should receive broad immunity for official acts during his time in office did not mean the conviction should be dismissed, ruling that the evidence presented by the Manhattan district attorney's office was not related to Trump's official conduct as president.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg had argued that Trump's conviction should be upheld. The district attorney's office said in legal filings that the sentence could be delayed or modified as a result of Trump's reelection, but that dismissing a jury's conviction would be an \"extreme remedy\" that was unwarranted. A spokesperson for the office declined to comment Friday.\n\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung called the Friday ruling is a \"direct violation\" of the Supreme Court's immunity decision.\n\n\"President Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the Witch Hunts. There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead,\" Cheung said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Trump officially rolls out his plan to eliminate the Department of Education. Here's what it would mean for Americans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has officially introduced his plan to eliminate the Department of Education . It could disrupt student loans , funding for public schools , and measuring students' achievements in reading and math .\n\nOn Thursday, Trump signed an executive order directing his new education secretary, Linda McMahon, to begin the process of eliminating the Department of Education.\n\nHe said that \"useful functions,\" including Pell Grants and Title I funding for low-income districts, will be \"fully preserved\" but redistributed to other federal agencies.\n\n\"But beyond these core necessities,\" Trump said, \"my administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department. We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible.\"\n\nShutting down the agency requires congressional approval; while Trump and McMahon are seeking to reduce the agency's capacity, completely eliminating it would need 60 Senate votes. Sen. Bill Cassidy, chair of the Senate education committee, said in a statement that he will \"support the President's goals by submitting legislation to accomplish this as soon as possible.\"\n\nMcMahon said during her confirmation hearing that \"Trump understands that we'll be working with Congress\" to make changes to the Department of Education.\n\n\"We'd like to do this right,\" she said. \"We'd like to make sure that we are presenting a plan that I think our senators could get on board with.\"\n\nSome Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation to abolish the department.\n\nIn November, Sen. Mike Rounds put forth a bill to eliminate the department and \"redistribute all critical federal programs under other departments.\" The bill proposed placing the federal student loans program under the authority of the Treasury Department.\n\nThe executive order follows the Department of Education's recent move to restructure the agency by cutting its workforce in half. On March 11, the department announced it was firing over 1,300 workers , leaving just over 2,000 employees remaining at the agency.\n\nSome advocates have already said they're prepared to take Trump to court over this executive order. Aaron Ament, president of borrower advocacy group Student Defense, said in a statement that \"there's no Executive Order the President can sign to legally eliminate the Department of Education.\"\n\n\"We're already preparing to stop the dismantling of the Department of Education in court,\" he said.\n\nThe Department of Education primarily facilitates federal funding and research, including billions in funding for the Title I program that provides federal assistance to school districts to help low-income students. It also manages the trillion-dollar student-loan portfolio, along with funding for districts to teach students with disabilities.\n\nAnother core component of the Education Department is its research arm, which collects data on kids' progress on a range of subjects including reading and math. Education experts previously told BI that the data collection is in jeopardy following Trump's move in February to end $900 million in research contracts .\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers said that gutting the department would have a significant impact on the US education system.\n\n\"The staff at the Department provide real services that impact the daily lives of students and their families from enforcing students' civil rights and providing transparent information on how our schools are doing to processing critical aid such as Pell Grants to helping low-income students all over our nation attend college and further their careers,\" Sen. Patty Murray wrote in a recent letter .\n\nThe executive order Trump signed delivers on his past statements that the Department of Education should not exist. The president and other Republicans have said that individual states should be in charge of education - even as states already have significant control - and other agencies can take on some of the department's responsibilities.\n\nThis executive order also reflects the goals of the DOGE office - a Trump-created effort unofficially led by Elon Musk that aims to slash government waste. Vivek Ramaswamy, who previously co-led DOGE but has since stepped down, called for eliminating the Department of Education in December following results showing kids' low reading scores in the US.\n\nSome education policy experts previously told BI there's little indication that getting rid of the department would be effective in addressing certain education issues, such as low reading scores.\n\n\"If it weren't for the Department of Education, we wouldn't know\" much about reading scores to begin with, said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow and deputy director of education policy at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute.\n\nAfter getting confirmed, McMahon detailed her plans for a \"historic final mission\" for the Department of Education, which included goals to center the department's work on parental rights and removing \"divisive DEI\" programs from curricula.\n\n\"Removing red tape and bureaucratic barriers will empower parents to make the best educational choices for their children,\" McMahon said. \"An effective transfer of educational oversight to the states will mean more autonomy for local communities. Teachers, too, will benefit from less micromanagement in the classroom-enabling them to get back to basics.\"\n\nHave a tip?

      "text": "Trump said he struck a deal with Paul Weiss. The law firm's internal copy has a major difference.\n\nOn Thursday night, President Donald Trump announced he agreed to withdraw his executive order targeting Paul Weiss after the elite law firm agreed that it \"will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies.\"\n\nBut that line is nowhere to be found in an internal version of the agreement about the Paul Weiss executive order sent to its own lawyers about 30 minutes later, according to a copy obtained by Business Insider.\n\nInstead, it only says the firm \"affirms its commitment to merit-based hiring, promotion, and retention\" and will hire experts to do a \"comprehensive audit of all of its employment practices\" - language that is also in the version Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nThe dueling documents emerged after Trump issued an executive order stripping security clearances from Paul Weiss lawyers and threatening government contracts with the firm. Both versions show Trump agreed to rescind this order after the firm promised $40 million in pro bono legal services and made other commitments.\n\nPaul Weiss's version also omits a statement from the White House saying that the law firm's chairman, Brad Karp , \"acknowledged the wrongdoing of former Paul, Weiss partner, Mark Pomerantz, the grave dangers of Weaponization, and the vital need to restore our System of Justice\" in a meeting with Trump.\n\nPomerantz, a frequent target of Trump's ire and a former Paul Weiss partner, joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office during its criminal investigation into Trump's hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels.\n\nPomerantz left the prosecutor's office before the case went to trial and wrote a book about his frustrations with how the investigation was handled. A jury in May found Trump guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business documents in order to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. He was sentenced to an \"unconditional discharge\" - essentially, no punishment - and has filed an appeal.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a special interest in the diversity initiatives of Big Law firms . The acting chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Andrea Lucas, a Trump appointee, sent letters to 20 elite firms this week with detailed questions about their diversity programs.\n\nRepresentatives for Paul Weiss and the White House didn't immediately respond to requests for comment about the discrepancy. In an email sent to firm staff, Karp said the deal was consistent with the firm's principles.\n\n\"With this behind us, we can devote our complete focus - as we always do - to our clients, our work, our colleagues, and our firm,\" he wrote.\n\nIn some ways, Paul Weiss is like every other big law firm. Its attorneys work late nights on deals and defense work for some of America's biggest companies, and top partners charge more than $2,000 an hour for their advice.\n\nBut in important ways, it's not. While many law firms' lawyers and staff skew Democratic, Paul Weiss has long been close with Democratic power players. Its partners include two members of former president Barack Obama's cabinet, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Its chairman, Brad Karp , was a major fundraiser for Kamala Harris, and its partner, Karen Dunn, helped Harris prepare for debates.\n\nSabina Lippman, the managing partner of the legal recruiting firm CenterPeak who has worked with Paul Weiss, said law-firm partners and leaders she's spoken to felt settling was smart. A firm could lose business if it got sucked into a long-running political fight, she said.\n\n\"Everyone has been in uniform agreement that this was a brilliant and well executed move,\" she said in a text message.\n\nPerkins Coie , which was also targeted by one of Trump's executive orders, sued the administration and promptly won a temporary restraining order from a judge. Perkins said in court papers that it faced existential risks from the executive order, which would require its clients with government contracts to reveal whether they use the firm - creating pressure to cut ties.\n\nThe president issued a narrower memorandum targeting any lawyers at the Big Law firm Covington & Burling who may have assisted former Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith, who filed two now-dismissed criminal cases against Trump. The law firm hasn't publicly reacted to the order.\n\nAt an Oval Office event Friday, Trump said big law firms \"all want to make deals\" after they \"went after me for four years - ruthlessly, violently, illegally.\"\n\n\"They're not babies. They're very sophisticated people,\" Trump said. \"Those law firms did bad things.\"\n\nOn Thursday night, Skadden Arps associate Rachel Cohen resigned from her position due to what she described as an inadequate response to Trump's actions.\n\nSkadden \"has been given time and opportunity to do the right thing,\" she wrote in her resignation letter, which went viral on LinkedIn. \"Thus far, we have not. This is a moment that demands urgency.\"\n\nBrent Griffiths contributed reporting.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Donald Trump is taking aim at Big Law\n\nDonald Trump issued another order on Friday revoking the security clearance of employees at Paul Weiss, a major law firm associated with his political opponents.\n\nThe Friday order is the third time in as many weeks that the president has singled out law firms - Paul Weiss , Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling - to have their workers' clearances revoked. He also ordered a review of their government contracts. It comes just days after a federal judge blocked the order against Perkins Coie, arguing it was likely unconstitutional.\n\nCritics warn that the president's efforts to bar the law firms' employees from interacting with federal agencies or even entering federal buildings could not only put the firms out of business but also erode the rights of lawyers - and people seeking legal counsel - across the country.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House, Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nTrump's order against Paul Weiss singled out attorney Mark Pomerantz, who had previously left the firm to join the Manhattan District Attorney's office investigation into Trump's finances until his resignation from the case in February 2022. Additionally, the order highlights that a Paul Weiss partner, on behalf of the District of Columbia Attorney General, brought a pro bono suit against individuals accused of participating in the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol .\n\nThe order says allowing employees of the Paul Weiss firm to maintain their security clearance \"would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.\"\n\nSimilarly, Trump's March 6 order against Perkins Coie described the firm's activity as \"dangerous and dishonest,\" highlighting the firm's representation of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in her 2016 run against Trump.\n\n\"Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, which then manufactured a false 'dossier' designed to steal an election,\" the order reads, referring to a memo compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele in the run-up to the election, which contained allegations of collusion between Trump's campaign and the Russian government.\n\nMany of the claims in the so-called Steele dossier were uncorroborated, though some were eventually verified .\n\nOn February 25, Trump issued a separate memo targeting Covington & Burling . The memo specifically named and suspended the security clearance of attorney Peter Koski, who provided legal assistance to former Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith led the investigations into Trump and his affiliates related to efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election and the possession of highly classified documents at the Mar-a-Lago social club following his presidency.\n\nIn each of the orders, Trump accused the named law firms and specific attorneys of weaponizing the judicial process.\n\nPaul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling are among the largest law firms in the United States, with multibillion-dollar annual revenues, according to AmLaw Global 200 Rankings. Each firm employs more than 1,000 attorneys and support staff like paralegals, researchers, and case managers.\n\nAnyone working at the firm who works a case involving a government contract or represents a client involved in government work - or a claim against the government - could require a security clearance, Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it's someone working on a classified documents case or a case involving terrorism, they have to have clearance to review the material that is the evidence and the discovery in the case,\" Rahmani said. \"Anything that may touch upon national security and military secrets, the lawyers have to have that clearance, and if they're not afforded that clearance, they can't engage in the representation.\"\n\nRemoving that clearance is a blow to each firm's business - a potentially fatal one, a lawyer representing Perkins Coie said in a recent hearing.\n\n\"It truly is life-threatening,\" Politico reported Dane Butswinkas, who represents Perkins Coie, said during an emergency hearing in which the firm challenged the legality of the president's order. \"It will spell the end of the law firm.\"\n\nRahmani said the revocation of the lawyers' security clearances could also impact clients seeking counsel, by limiting who they are able to retain to attorneys that the Trump administration allows to have clearance.\n\nPolitico reported the judge ruled on Wednesday during the emergency hearing that the \"retaliatory animus\" of Trump's order against Perkins Coie is \"clear on its face\" and \"runs head-on into the wall of First Amendment protections.\"\n\nHowell issued a temporary restraining order, blocking portions of the president's order from taking effect against Perkins Coie staff while legal challenges play out. The orders affecting Paul Weiss and Covington & Burling staff remain in effect.\n\n\"This may be amusing in 'Alice in Wonderland' where the Queen of Hearts yells, 'Off with their heads!' at annoying subjects ... and announces a sentence before a verdict,\" Politico reported Howell said. \"But this cannot be the reality we are living under.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump targeted 20 of the biggest law firms over their diversity programs. A GOP favorite is missing from the list.\n\nThe Trump administration's all-out legal war extends beyond the courts.\n\nIn addition to ferociously battling lawsuits over its sweeping policies, the government is targeting law firms themselves .\n\nIn the latest salvo, Andrea Lucas, the newly minted acting chair of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, sent letters to 20 of the country's most prominent big law firms with detailed questions about their diversity programs.\n\nThe letters piled on top a pair of executive orders where Trump targeted Perkins Coie and Paul Weiss, criticizing their diversity initiatives and complaining about how he believes the firms wronged him politically several years ago.\n\nOne law firm absent from the target list is Jones Day.\n\nJones Day has been closely intertwined with Trump's White House. The firm represented Donald Trump's 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns and the Republican National Committee in 2024.\n\nJones Day also appears to have many of the same diversity programs as the 20 law firms Lucas contacted.\n\nLucas's letter inquired about each firm's hiring and promotion practices and affinity groups for underrepresented demographics.\n\nUnder the header of \"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,\" a 2024 Jones Day brochure on the firm's diversity touts how it \"aggressively pursues\" hiring and career development of lawyers from \"historically underrepresented backgrounds.\"\n\nEvery year, Jones Day hosts a \"Diversity Conference\" for first-year law students. This year's is scheduled to take place in April in Atlanta, Georgia, according to its website.\n\nThe firm also has affinity groups that \"celebrate diversity within our organization,\" including chapters for Black, Hispanic, and LGBTQ+ lawyers.\n\nA Jones Day representative didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump's executive orders restricted security clearance and access to government buildings for lawyers at Perkins Coie and Paul Weiss, which they say made it hard to represent their clients.\n\nThe president also issued a separate memorandum suspending security clearances of any lawyers working at Covington & Burling who've helped former Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith , who brought two now-dropped indictments against Trump.\n\nIn her letters to the 20 law firms, which includes Perkins Coie, Lucas warned that the law forbade hiring or promotions \"motivated - in whole or in part - by race, sex, or another protected characteristic.\" She also said employers are barred \"from limiting, segregating, or classifying employees based on race, sex, or other protected characteristics\" in a way that could deprive them of opportunities, including in affinity groups.\n\nA group of former EEOC commissioners asked Lucas to withdraw the 20 letters, saying she had \"no authority\" to grill the law firms. In a March 18 letter, they said Congress required investigations to be \"confidential\" so the EEOC could not \"intimidate employers through public pressure.\"\n\nThrough an EEOC spokesperson, Lucas, who Trump appointed to the commission in his first term, declined Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nAt a New York University law school conference panel last year, Lucas said many employers are \"dead wrong\" about the legality of certain diversity initiatives .\n\nAccording to Lucas, the law forbids race or sex from being \"part of the equation\" at all, including for deciding who could attend career development or leadership programs.\n\n\"I think it is a major blind spot for employers to not scrutinize DEI programs that fall outside of hiring, firing, and compensation decisions,\" she said.\n\nThe language in Lucas's letters and public statements echoes arguments made by conservative activist Edward Blum, whose organization Students for Fair Admissions successfully persuaded the Supreme Court to end affirmative action in colleges .\n\nAnother one of his projects, American Alliance for Equal Rights, sued Perkins Coie in 2023 over its fellowships reserved exclusively for students who identified as LGBTQ+, had a disability, or were people of color. The case was dismissed after Perkins Coie agreed to change the fellowship programs.\n\nIn an email, Blum declined to answer if he's advised members of the Trump administration. But he praised the rationale behind Lucas's letters.\n\n\"The race-based employment practices that many law firms have used during the last few years have been deeply polarizing and illegal,\" Blum wrote. \"The new leadership at the EEOC, as well as other federal agencies, are to be commended for identifying these practices and, it is to be hoped, demanding they be eliminated.\"\n\nPaul Weiss effectively settled with Trump.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Thursday night announcing he would rescind his executive order targeting the firm, the president said Paul Weiss agreed it \"will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies\" and would spend $40 million in pro bono legal services supporting his administration's initiatives. Trump's post also included a statement saying Paul Weiss leader Brad Karp \"acknowledged the wrongdoing\" of former partner Mark Pomerantz , who had been a part of the prosecution team at the Manhattan district attorney's office investigating his hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels.\n\nPerkins Coie took a different tack and sued to stop Trump's executive order targeting the firm.\n\nEarlier in March, a court granted Perkins Coie a temporary restraining order requiring federal agencies to disregard and rescind any guidance related to Trump's executive action. But the court order specifically didn't apply to two paragraphs where Trump ordered the EEOC and US Attorney General to investigate \"large, influential, or industry leading law firms\" for \"compliance with race-based and sex-based non-discrimination laws.\"\n\nDiversity programs like affinity groups would only be unlawful if they aren't open to all employees who want to join, according to Asker Saeed, an attorney who advises law firms on DEI issues.\n\nMost law firms appear to be \"staying the course\" on their employee diversity programs while keeping a watchful eye on Trump, said Saeed, a partner at Kumar Prabhu Patel & Banerjee.\n\n\"As it stands right now, the law is still the law,\" he said. \"What was legal before the Trump administration came in is still legal. And what was illegal before the Trump administration came in is still illegal.\"\n\nThe rank-and-file of Jones Day predominantly supports Democrats. In the 2024 election, its employees donated five times as much money to Kamala Harris' presidential campaign compared to Trump's, according to Federal Elections Committee data compiled by Open Secrets.\n\nTrump has lashed out against lawyers who have turned against him, such as Michael Cohen , who worked at the Trump Organization for decades before becoming the key witness in his Manhattan criminal trial.\n\nUpon those who remain loyal , Trump heaps rewards. Pamela Bondi , who defended Trump in his first impeachment trial, is now Attorney General. Todd Blanche and Emil Bove , his lawyers in the Manhattan criminal case, now serve in other top Justice Department posts. Alina Habba , Trump's go-to lawyer for personal cases, is now a White House advisor.\n\nDon McGahn, a prominent Jones Day lawyer, served as White House counsel during Trump's first term, leading the selection of federal court appointments. And the firm's attorneys have continued to find their way to powerful positions in the second Trump administration.\n\nOver at Jones Day, high salaries and proximity to power have helped make it an attractive employer - since 2011, it's hired nearly 100 former US Supreme Court clerks.\n\nOther elite Trump-friendly firms, like Sullivan & Cromwell, which agreed to appeal his Manhattan criminal conviction, and Troutman Pepper Locke, which represented Trump family members in the New York Attorney General's civil fraud trial against the Trump Organization , are also missing from the EEOC list.\n\nEarlier this month, the president of the American Bar Association criticized \"a clear and disconcerting pattern\" where Trump targeted lawyers representing \"parties the administration does not like\" to intimidate critics.\n\n\"Clients have the right to have access to their lawyer without interference by the government,\" William R. Bay said in a statement. \"Lawyers must be free to represent clients and perform their ethical duty without fear of retribution.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump: The SBA will take over managing student loans from the Education Department\n\nStudent loans are moving to the Small Business Administration, President Donald Trump said.\n\nOne day after signing an executive order to begin the process of eliminating the Department of Education , Trump said in an Oval Office appearance on Friday the SBA will take over the management of $1.7 trillion in federal student loans.\n\n\"We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans, tens of thousands of loans, pretty complicated deal, and that's coming out of the Department of Education immediately, and it's going to be headed up by Kelly Loeffler, SBA, and they're all set for it,\" Trump said. \"They're waiting for it. It would be serviced much better than it has in the past. It's been a mess.\"\n\nThe SBA announced on Friday that it's reducing its workforce by 43%, saying that \"core services to the public\" like disaster assistance programs will not be impacted.\n\nTrump also said that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the head of the Health and Human Services Department, will be handling special needs and nutrition programs.\n\nThe Department of Education and SBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Kennedy wrote in a post on X that HHS is \"f ully prepared to take on the responsibility of supporting individuals with special needs and overseeing nutrition programs that were ran by @usedgov.\"\n\nIt's unclear how the SBA will manage the federal student-loan portfolio. Trump's executive order said that Education Secretary Linda McMahon should take steps to close the department while \"ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\"\n\nStill, with over 40 million Americans holding student loans, it would be a significant undertaking, especially with those borrowers being on different repayment plans and relief schedules. Jared Bass, senior vice president for education at the left-leaning think-tank Center for American Progress, told BI that other agencies aren't equipped to manage the Department of Education's tasks.\n\nThe department \"has people that are well versed in the oversight,\" Bass said, and \"having a Secretary of Education focused on one particular thing within the Cabinet agency is helpful, not hurtful.\"\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon wrote in an opinion piece on Fox News on Friday that eliminating the Department of Education \"will not happen tomorrow.\"\n\n\"But we can move in that direction immediately by revising guidance documents and grant competitions to advance the president's vision of returning education authority to state and local education leaders,\" she wrote.\n\nThe department had already cut 50% of its staff as part of its agency reorganization efforts. McMahon and Trump have maintained that programs like student loans and grants for low-income students will not be impacted, but advocates and some education experts have said that's likely not the case.\n\n\"You can't have programs without people, and if you are issuing risks and reducing staff by nearly 50%, that's going to impact service, that's going to impact delivery,\" Bass said.\n\nSome advocates criticized Trump's plan to transfer the student-loan portfolio to SBA. Jessica Thompson, senior vice president of the Institute of College Access and Success, said in a statement that this action cannot happen without congressional approval.\n\n\"Should policymakers mistakenly proceed with a transfer of the loan portfolio to another agency, we urge them to craft a thoughtful, methodical plan to transfer these major and complex functions to prevent a total breakdown of the system-and real financial harm for millions,\" Thompson said.\n\nHave a tip?

      "text": "Donald Trump is serving a second presidential term. Here's the lowdown on his personal life, career, and politics.\n\nDonald Trump is president - again.\n\nAfter his inauguration on January 20, 2025, the businessman and former reality television star commenced his second term. Long a fixture of the American cultural scene and now the 45th and 47th president of the United States, he will continue to have untold political influence.\n\nTrump first entered politics in June 2015 when he descended an escalator at Trump Tower in New York City and announced he was entering the 2016 presidential race. Trump's presidency altered the very fabric of the Republican Party, bucking some traditional conservative values and ushering in the MAGA - Make America Great Again - era.\n\nHere's a closer look at Trump's personal history and wide-ranging career.\n\nStarting on his very first moments in office, Trump signed a flurry of day one executive orders and rescinded many of former President Joe Biden's executive actions.\n\nTrump's earliest actions built on themes from his campaign, from an immigration crackdown , to increasing oil and gas production, to shrinking the federal workforce and calling employees back to the office. He signed a series of orders rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, demanding that government-run diversity offices shut down and green-lighting probes into private companies' DEI efforts. He also issued around 1,500 pardons for January 6 -related offenses included six commutations in the package, including for individuals who had been charged with seditious conspiracy.\n\nTrump also used an executive order to form the Department of Government Efficiency , Elon Musk's cost-cutting and deregulatory body. Despite saying the group would exist outside of government during the campaign, the executive order brought DOGE inside the White House.\n\nTech and corporate leaders beyond Musk have also featured prominently in Trump's second term, with some formally serving in his administration. Silicon Valley leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos , had prime spots at his inauguration.\n\nCongress also confirmed a number of Trump's more controversial Cabinet picks , including Pete Hegseth for defense secretary. Marco Rubio soared to confirmation as the secretary of state in a unanimous vote. One of Trump's most contentious nominees, former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, withdrew from consideration amid allegations of sex-trafficking.\n\nTrump announced his third presidential bid just after the 2022 midterms, and almost two years before election day in 2024. He easily beat his primary rivals and prepared for a rematch against Biden.\n\nTrump complained when Biden dropped out of the presidential race at the end of July and former vice president Kamala Harris soared to the top of the ticket. Polls showed Trump and Harris closely tied in the final days of the race, though Trump ultimately pulled off a comfortable victory, sweeping the seven swing states and winning 312 electoral votes to Harris' 226. He also won the popular vote - the first time a Republican has done so in 20 years.\n\nWhile surveys suggested Biden's unpopularity may have proven unsurmountable for Harris, other stats showed how younger voters tilted red, Latino voters increasingly backed Trump, and economic frustrations likely pushed the needle in his favor, too.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans regained Senate control and maintained control of the House, paving the way for Trump to make judicial appointments and fill any vacancies on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe election cycle was defined by political violence: There were two alleged assassination attempts against Trump , one in Pennsylvania and the other in Florida. The then-candidate survived both.\n\nOn July 13, Thomas Matthew Crooks shot at Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, nicking his ear using an AR-style rifle. A Secret Service sniper killed Crooks, whose motive for the shooting remains unclear. The first assassination attempt quickly became a rallying cry for Trump supporters, and Elon Musk endorsed the former president shortly after.\n\nThe second assassination attempt occurred on Sept. 15 in Palm Beach, Florida at a golf course. Ryan Wesley Routh , the suspect, may have staked out the course for 12 hours. Law enforcement officials said that Routh got close to Trump but didn't have a clear line of sight of the former president. They also said that a Secret Service agent spotted Routh's rifle through a fence and immediately opened fire, at which point the suspect fled. On September 16, Routh was charged with two firearms counts.\n\nGiven the two candidates' wildly different politics, the competition turned nasty at times, with Trump questioning Harris' race and continuing a pattern of misogynistic comments toward female opponents.\n\nIn terms of the economy, a top issue for many voters, Trump promised to extend his hallmark 2017 tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips. He also threatened broad 10 to 20% tariffs on imported goods , which economists predicted would fuel inflation.\n\nTrump's views on abortion were a sticky subject in the post-Roe environment. He took credit for overturning Roe v. Wade during the race but tempered his stance to appeal to rising pro-choice sentiment. Trump said that states should decide the laws around abortion and didn't publicly supported a federal ban. In August, Trump said that the federal government should pay for costly IVF treatments .\n\nTrump criticized Israel's actions in Gaza at times but portrayed himself as a strong defender of the Israeli state and hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. A temporary cease-fire between Israel and Gaza went into effect days before Trump took office for the second time.\n\nWith respect to the war in Ukraine, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war on Day One , though did not do so on his first day in office. He avoided explicitly saying that he wants Ukraine to win during the campaign.\n\nDonald Trump's legal troubles stretch back to the very beginning of his business career. In 1973, the US Justice Department sued Fred and Donald Trump for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act in various New York City apartment buildings. The parties settled the suit two years later and the Trumps did not admit to any wrongdoing.\n\nTrump's political rise is backlit by controversy as well, from the personal scandals that have plagued his candidacies to his new status as the first former president convicted of a federal crime . The FBI investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election , but ultimately concluded that there wasn't sufficient evidence to prove that \"members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.\" Yet the report did find \"numerous links\" between the two groups.\n\nWhile in office during his first term, Trump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, but the Senate acquitted him both times.\n\nThe chamber first impeached him in 2019 on articles charging him with abuses of power and obstruction of justice. He is accused of offering Ukraine a quid-quo-pro: dig up dirt on Biden in exchange for military aid.\n\nThe second impeachment articles relate to his ongoing efforts to overturn the 2020 election and actions on January 6, 2021 , when a violent mob stormed the Capitol. As lawmakers convened to certify the election results, Trump encouraged his supporters to attend a rally in DC to protest the joint session of Congress. Thousands showed up, including some from white supremacist groups and right-wing militias.\n\nWhen speaking to the crowd, Trump did not explicitly call for violence, but encouraged his followers to \"fight like hell\" - many of those same followers stormed the Capitol moments later, overwhelming police and forcing lawmakers to flee. Five people died during or shortly after the event, including a Capitol police officer.\n\nCongress reconvened to certify the election results in the early hours of January 7 and Biden was inaugurated on January 20, 2021. Meanwhile, Trump continues to deny that he lost the election in 2020 , refusing to admit defeat.\n\nAfter he left office, an avalanche of lawsuits against Trump piled up, many of which are stalled or are no longer being pursued after the election.\n\nThe former president has been charged in four criminal cases: a federal election interference case, a classified documents case, a Georgia election interference case, and a hush-money case. Trump had used money from two of his PACs to pay his legal fees.\n\nIn the federal election interference case , special prosecutor Jack Smith accused Trump of engaging in a broad effort to undermine Biden's 2020 win. Smith argued that Trump amplified false claims about voter fraud , pressured elected officials, and organized fake electors. He dropped the case after the 2024 election, but filed a report shortly before the inauguration saying that Trump would have been convicted if he hadn't won another term.\n\nSmith also led the charge on a federal case accusing Trump of storing sensitive national security documents at Mar-a-Lago after removing them from the White House, and impeding the government from retrieving the documents. A Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed the case over highly controversial allegations that Smith's special counsel appointment was unconstitutional , a finding Smith's office appealed. The case was also ultimately dismissed after the election.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments made to Stormy Daniels , a porn star who alleges she had an affair with Trump. With the guilty verdict, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nOn January 10, 2025, the judge in that case sentenced Trump , cementing his felon status. The president did not receive any punishment, but the decision set off a new slate of legal questions, as Trump has pledged to appeal his criminal conviction.\n\nGeorgia's election interference case focused specifically on Trump's alleged attempts to overturn Biden's win in the state. District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump and allies in August of 2023, though the case shrunk in scope and a judge dismissed several counts against Trump . The case was mired in scandals involving Willis' personal life , and her team was eventually disqualified. Willis is appealing the decision, which could take months. If Willis wins the appeal, she'll have to wait until Trump finishes his second term to re-start the case.\n\nIn addition to the criminal trials, a jury found Trump guilty of sexual abuse in a civil case brought by E. Jean Carroll . The saga, which has extended over two suits, related to Carroll's allegation that Trump raped her in a Manhattan department store and subsequently made defamatory statements. Together, they resulted in a verdict granting Carroll damages of $88.3 million. Trump appealed the cases but a jury upheld one of the verdicts in December, 2025 . A spokesperson for Trump told BI he plans to keep appealing the verdict, which could keep the $5 million that Trump owes Carroll through that case frozen.\n\nAn ubiquitous presence in American life since the 1980s, Trump floated running for president since his early days as a businessman. People generally didn't take him seriously, and his political affiliations flip-flopped - he went from being a registered Democrat, to a registered Republican, to the front man for a remade American conservatism.\n\nIn 2012, Trump gained prominence in Republican circles for popularizing the \"birther\" theory - the racist and false claim that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. And in the summer of 2015, the prospect of a Trump presidential bid became much more real when he announced his candidacy at a campaign rally in New York City.\n\nThroughout the 2016 campaign, Trump positioned himself as a political outsider and built his platform around economic prosperity, immigration, and a newly combative rhetoric. His campaign was mired in controversy - from the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged about groping women to his failure to quickly denounce the KKK - but he appealed to a wide swath of Americans.\n\nDespite doing poorly in the early Iowa caucus, Trump triumphed in a series of primary wins and had a strong performance on Super Tuesday. After becoming the Republican nominee, Trump trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls but ended up victorious on November 8, 2016. He lost the popular vote by more than 2.8 million but won 304 electoral votes to Clinton's 227.\n\nOnce in the White House, Trump was quick to issue a slate of executive orders based on his campaign promises, including building a wall on the southern border and implementing his proposed \"Muslim ban,\" which quickly faced legal challenges.\n\nWhile running for office, Trump promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but doing so proved difficult and contentious, so he instead chipped away at the law. He also repealed many Obama-era environmental policies and withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement because he said it damaged the economy.\n\nTrump took an isolationist approach to foreign policy, imposing tariffs and withdrawing from revising long-standing trade agreements. On the economy, Trump pushed a $1.5 trillion tax cut package through Congress. Regarding the Supreme Court, he appointed three conservative judges and took credit for overturning Roe v. Wade .\n\nBy his final years in office, Trump was both president and candidate - he launched his reelection bid in June 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic upended both the election and spelled the end of Trump's presidency. President Joe Biden had accused him throughout the election of ignoring the crisis. Trump came down with COVID-19 himself during the final weeks of the campaign and received treatment at Walter Reed Medical Center.\n\nWhen election day finally rolled around, Trump eventually lost both the popular and Electoral College votes. The race was extremely close in key states and took days to call. Trump declared victory one day after the election, before all the votes were tallied, and thus inaugurated his months-long campaign contesting the election results.\n\nAfter leaving office in January 2021, Trump and Melania moved to Mar-a-Lago, where he has lived since leaving the White House.\n\nDonald Trump has a marital history marked by various divorces and alleged affairs.\n\nHe met his first wife, Czech model Ivana Marie Zelníčková, in 1976 when she was in New York City for a fashion show. The two got married in 1977 and remained a fixture of the city's tabloid scene. They had three children together: Ivanka , Donald Jr., and Eric.\n\nRumors about Trump having affairs swirled throughout the marriage, including with American actor Marla Maples. Ivana and Trump divorced in 1992.\n\nOne year later, Maples had Trump's fourth child, Tiffany. The couple got married two months later but split up in 1999.\n\nTrump's current wife, Melania Trump (née Knauss), is a Slovenian-American former model whom he met in 1998 at a mutual friend's party. The two dated on and off before tying the knot in 2004 at Mar-a-Lago. The star-studded guest list included the Clintons and Billy Joel.\n\nTrump's fifth child, Barron Trump , was born in 2006. When Trump moved into the White House, Melania and Barron waited months before joining him at the residence.\n\nIn addition to his five children, Trump has 10 grandkids . The oldest, Kai, has already stepped onto the political scene and even spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention.\n\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in the Queens borough of New York City . At 78 years old, he was the oldest person to run for president . Compared to other former presidents, Trump has released relatively little information on his physical health.\n\nIn November 2023, his personal physician said measures of his physical health were within the normal range but did not provide details about his medication, blood pressure, or cholesterol. Standing at a reported height of 6 feet 3 inches, some have expressed concern about Trump's weight in the past.\n\nHis parents, real estate developer Fred Trump and Mary MacLeod, met at a party and got married in 1936. They had five children, with Donald Trump being their fourth. He attended a Presbyterian church as a child but doesn't appear to regularly attend church services.\n\nFred Trump made much of his fortune in New York City real estate and was the subject of a US Senate investigation related to taking advantage of a federal loan program.\n\nAs a teenager, Donald Trump attended New York Military Academy, a private military school. After graduating, he attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years before eventually switching to the Wharton School of Finance and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. Trump graduated from Wharton with a bachelor's degree in economics and talks about his time at the prestigious institution often.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Trump began working for his father and eventually became the president of a collection of family-owned companies that he later turned into the Trump Organization . Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Trump expanded his father's business and invested in Manhattan hotels. He was buoyed along by financial and social help from his father, whose New York connections ran deep.\n\nIn 1983, Trump opened Trump Tower on 56th Street and 5th Avenue, where he later had an apartment. That same decade, Trump started investing in casinos and bought Mar-a-Lago , his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe 1990s recession harmed Trump's businesses and he was forced to sell various assets, as well as commit to a personal budget. His luck largely changed by the end of the 1990s, though his casinos continued to struggle.\n\nTrump profited from his name throughout his long business career, selling everything from branded cologne and steaks to putting his name on an online education company. In 2018, The New York Times published a lengthy investigation detailing how Fred Trump funneled money to his son. The outlet reported Donald Trump received the equivalent of $413 million from his dad by the early 2000s. (Trump declined the Times's request for comment on the article at the time; a Trump spokesman at the time said there had been no fraud or tax evasion.)\n\nIn 1996, Trump teamed up with NBC to buy the Miss Universe Organization, which encompasses the Miss Universe, Miss USA , and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. Trump then starred in a reality television show of his own - \" The Apprentice .\" The Emmy-nominated program made him nearly $200 million over 16 years and boosted his image as a self-made billionaire.\n\nTrump's net worth was $3.8 billion as of September 2024, according to Forbes's calculations.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "5 things to know about Trump's tumultuous relationship with the Fed\n\nPresident Donald Trump's relationship with the Federal Reserve is complicated.\n\nWhile Fed policy is meant to be separate from politics, Trump has had no issue with making public statements about what he thinks the central bank should be doing.\n\nHe has long called for lower interest rates and has raised concerns that he could try to erode the independence of the Fed to exert greater influence on monetary policy.\n\nTensions were on display this week after the Fed's latest policy decision to leave interest rates unchanged, as officials eye higher inflation and lower growth in 2025.\n\nAs the Fed tries to navigate Trump's policies and his attempts to insert himself into the rate-setting process, here are five things to know about Trump's tumultuous relationship with the central bank.\n\nThe president made his dissatisfaction with the Fed's latest rate decision known on Wednesday. Hours after the Fed concluded its March policy meeting, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to call on the central bank to take interest rates lower.\n\n\"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing,\" Trump wrote on the social media platform Wednesday night.\n\nTrump's latest call isn't the first time he's tried to exert his influence on monetary policy.\n\nAddressing the World Economic Forum earlier this year, Trump said he would demand that \" interest rates drop immediately .\"\n\nLast year, concerns were also raised about the Fed's independence after reports that allies were drafting plans for Trump to exert more power over the central bank's policy decisions.\n\nTrump, who appointed Fed Chair Powell during his first term, has long butted heads central bank chief on interest rates. In his first four years in office, Trump questioned if Powell was an \"enemy\" of America in a post on Twitter, and reportedly asked White House lawyers to look into demoting Powell to a Fed governor.\n\nThe Fed, for its part, isn't signaling rate cuts in the near term. In their updated projections for the economy, the majority of Fed officials said they believed risks to inflation were skewed to the upside.\n\n\"No surprise that the monetary policy-setting committee kept target rates unchanged today. The committee is in the midst of policy fog as they await the impact from upcoming tariffs,\" Jeffrey Roach, the chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote on Wednesday, adding that he still expects inflation to cool enough to warrant a rate cut in June.\n\nThe Fed has resisted past calls from Trump, and investors don't think that this time will be different.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch tool, markets see a 79% chance the Fed will keep interest rates level at its next policy meeting in May and a 76% probability that rates will be lower by 25 basis points or more in June.\n\nPart of the recent pressure on inflation is due to Trump's tariff plan , Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press event on Wednesday, though he added it was difficult to tell precisely how much tariffs have contributed to inflation.\n\n\"Clearly, some of it, a good part of it, is coming from tariffs,\" Powell said, though he noted that the impact of tariffs on inflation could be short-lived.\n\n\"The key addition to the statement was the recognition that uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,' which seems to be the Fed's attempt at highlighting tariff risks while avoiding directly injecting itself in the political discussion,\" Jason Pride, the chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, said.\n\nAccording to its latest Summary of Economic Projections, the central bank expects inflation to fall back to 2% by 2027.\n\nTrump, though, has signaled that he's determined to push on with his trade war. The administration is planning to roll out a reciprocal tariff regime on April 2nd, which Trump referred to in his Truth Social post as \"Liberation Day for America.\"\n\nThe president, who used the stock market as a scorecard for his first term, appears to have his eye on a different metric for success this time around.\n\nIt's the 10-year US Treasury yield , which is a key lending benchmark for all kinds of loan products, including mortgages.\n\nWhile the administration has signaled it will tolerate market volatility , Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has repeated Trump's view that the ultimate goal is to rein in the 10-year yield to make borrowing cheaper.\n\n\"He and I are focused on the 10-year Treasury, and what is the yield of that,\" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business earlier this year. \"He wants lower rates . He is not calling for the Fed to lower rates,\" he added.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield dipped three basis points on Thursday to 4.22%. It is down more than 60 basis points from its peak of 4.8% earlier this year, when bonds sold off amid tariff jitters and expectations of higher inflation.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Donald Trump is taking aim at Big Law\n\nDonald Trump issued another order on Friday revoking the security clearance of employees at Paul Weiss, a major law firm associated with his political opponents.\n\nThe Friday order is the third time in as many weeks that the president has singled out law firms - Paul Weiss , Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling - to have their workers' clearances revoked. He also ordered a review of their government contracts. It comes just days after a federal judge blocked the order against Perkins Coie, arguing it was likely unconstitutional.\n\nCritics warn that the president's efforts to bar the law firms' employees from interacting with federal agencies or even entering federal buildings could not only put the firms out of business but also erode the rights of lawyers - and people seeking legal counsel - across the country.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House, Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nTrump's order against Paul Weiss singled out attorney Mark Pomerantz, who had previously left the firm to join the Manhattan District Attorney's office investigation into Trump's finances until his resignation from the case in February 2022. Additionally, the order highlights that a Paul Weiss partner, on behalf of the District of Columbia Attorney General, brought a pro bono suit against individuals accused of participating in the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol .\n\nThe order says allowing employees of the Paul Weiss firm to maintain their security clearance \"would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.\"\n\nSimilarly, Trump's March 6 order against Perkins Coie described the firm's activity as \"dangerous and dishonest,\" highlighting the firm's representation of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in her 2016 run against Trump.\n\n\"Perkins Coie hired Fusion GPS, which then manufactured a false 'dossier' designed to steal an election,\" the order reads, referring to a memo compiled by the former British spy Christopher Steele in the run-up to the election, which contained allegations of collusion between Trump's campaign and the Russian government.\n\nMany of the claims in the so-called Steele dossier were uncorroborated, though some were eventually verified .\n\nOn February 25, Trump issued a separate memo targeting Covington & Burling . The memo specifically named and suspended the security clearance of attorney Peter Koski, who provided legal assistance to former Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith led the investigations into Trump and his affiliates related to efforts to interfere with the lawful transfer of power following the 2020 presidential election and the possession of highly classified documents at the Mar-a-Lago social club following his presidency.\n\nIn each of the orders, Trump accused the named law firms and specific attorneys of weaponizing the judicial process.\n\nPaul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling are among the largest law firms in the United States, with multibillion-dollar annual revenues, according to AmLaw Global 200 Rankings. Each firm employs more than 1,000 attorneys and support staff like paralegals, researchers, and case managers.\n\nAnyone working at the firm who works a case involving a government contract or represents a client involved in government work - or a claim against the government - could require a security clearance, Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it's someone working on a classified documents case or a case involving terrorism, they have to have clearance to review the material that is the evidence and the discovery in the case,\" Rahmani said. \"Anything that may touch upon national security and military secrets, the lawyers have to have that clearance, and if they're not afforded that clearance, they can't engage in the representation.\"\n\nRemoving that clearance is a blow to each firm's business - a potentially fatal one, a lawyer representing Perkins Coie said in a recent hearing.\n\n\"It truly is life-threatening,\" Politico reported Dane Butswinkas, who represents Perkins Coie, said during an emergency hearing in which the firm challenged the legality of the president's order. \"It will spell the end of the law firm.\"\n\nRahmani said the revocation of the lawyers' security clearances could also impact clients seeking counsel, by limiting who they are able to retain to attorneys that the Trump administration allows to have clearance.\n\nPolitico reported the judge ruled on Wednesday during the emergency hearing that the \"retaliatory animus\" of Trump's order against Perkins Coie is \"clear on its face\" and \"runs head-on into the wall of First Amendment protections.\"\n\nHowell issued a temporary restraining order, blocking portions of the president's order from taking effect against Perkins Coie staff while legal challenges play out. The orders affecting Paul Weiss and Covington & Burling staff remain in effect.\n\n\"This may be amusing in 'Alice in Wonderland' where the Queen of Hearts yells, 'Off with their heads!' at annoying subjects ... and announces a sentence before a verdict,\" Politico reported Howell said. \"But this cannot be the reality we are living under.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump signs bill to fund the government for another 6 months\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday signed the high-stakes government funding bill approved by the Senate a day earlier, averting a partial government shutdown but leaving Democrats divided on their strategy to counter the administration.\n\nHarrison Fields, the White House principal deputy press secretary, wrote in a post on X that Trump signed the continuing resolution . Fields thanked a range of congressional leaders, from House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nThe bill - which funds the government through the end of September - trims non-defense spending by roughly $13 billion and increases defense spending by $6 billion.\n\nOn Friday, the GOP-controlled Senate voted 62-38 to advance the measure, with Schumer and nine other lawmakers who caucus with Democrats joining nearly every Republican.\n\nThe bill then passed the chamber in a final 54-46 vote. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine were the only members who caucus with Democrats to support the final measure, while GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the lone GOP opponent of the bill.\n\nThe bill's passage has exposed a major rift among Democrats on Capitol Hill, as virtually every House Democrat - including many hailing from critical swing districts - opposed passage of the bill. House Republicans, led by Johnson, passed the funding bill in a narrow 217-213 vote.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York opposed the funding bill and on Friday called it \"an attack on veterans, families, seniors and everyday Americans.\"\n\nSchumer, meanwhile, supported advancing the measure, drawing criticism from several progressive lawmakers, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who called the senator's push to assemble Democratic support for advancing the funding bill \"a tremendous mistake.\"\n\n\"This turns the federal government into a slush fund for Donald Trump and Elon Musk,\" Ocasio-Cortez said during a CNN interview that aired on Thursday. \"It sacrifices congressional authority, and it is deeply partisan.\"\n\nHowever, Schumer argued that a shutdown would have allowed the Trump administration to exert more power over reducing the size of the federal government.\n\n\"A shutdown will allow DOGE to shift into overdrive,\" the veteran New York senator said. \"Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Donald Trump is serving a second presidential term. Here's the lowdown on his personal life, career, and politics.\n\nDonald Trump is president - again.\n\nAfter his inauguration on January 20, 2025, the businessman and former reality television star commenced his second term. Long a fixture of the American cultural scene and now the 45th and 47th president of the United States, he will continue to have untold political influence.\n\nTrump first entered politics in June 2015 when he descended an escalator at Trump Tower in New York City and announced he was entering the 2016 presidential race. Trump's presidency altered the very fabric of the Republican Party, bucking some traditional conservative values and ushering in the MAGA - Make America Great Again - era.\n\nHere's a closer look at Trump's personal history and wide-ranging career.\n\nStarting on his very first moments in office, Trump signed a flurry of day one executive orders and rescinded many of former President Joe Biden's executive actions.\n\nTrump's earliest actions built on themes from his campaign, from an immigration crackdown , to increasing oil and gas production, to shrinking the federal workforce and calling employees back to the office. He signed a series of orders rolling back diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, demanding that government-run diversity offices shut down and green-lighting probes into private companies' DEI efforts. He also issued around 1,500 pardons for January 6 -related offenses included six commutations in the package, including for individuals who had been charged with seditious conspiracy.\n\nTrump also used an executive order to form the Department of Government Efficiency , Elon Musk's cost-cutting and deregulatory body. Despite saying the group would exist outside of government during the campaign, the executive order brought DOGE inside the White House.\n\nTech and corporate leaders beyond Musk have also featured prominently in Trump's second term, with some formally serving in his administration. Silicon Valley leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos , had prime spots at his inauguration.\n\nCongress also confirmed a number of Trump's more controversial Cabinet picks , including Pete Hegseth for defense secretary. Marco Rubio soared to confirmation as the secretary of state in a unanimous vote. One of Trump's most contentious nominees, former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, withdrew from consideration amid allegations of sex-trafficking.\n\nTrump announced his third presidential bid just after the 2022 midterms, and almost two years before election day in 2024. He easily beat his primary rivals and prepared for a rematch against Biden.\n\nTrump complained when Biden dropped out of the presidential race at the end of July and former vice president Kamala Harris soared to the top of the ticket. Polls showed Trump and Harris closely tied in the final days of the race, though Trump ultimately pulled off a comfortable victory, sweeping the seven swing states and winning 312 electoral votes to Harris' 226. He also won the popular vote - the first time a Republican has done so in 20 years.\n\nWhile surveys suggested Biden's unpopularity may have proven unsurmountable for Harris, other stats showed how younger voters tilted red, Latino voters increasingly backed Trump, and economic frustrations likely pushed the needle in his favor, too.\n\nAdditionally, Republicans regained Senate control and maintained control of the House, paving the way for Trump to make judicial appointments and fill any vacancies on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe election cycle was defined by political violence: There were two alleged assassination attempts against Trump , one in Pennsylvania and the other in Florida. The then-candidate survived both.\n\nOn July 13, Thomas Matthew Crooks shot at Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, nicking his ear using an AR-style rifle. A Secret Service sniper killed Crooks, whose motive for the shooting remains unclear. The first assassination attempt quickly became a rallying cry for Trump supporters, and Elon Musk endorsed the former president shortly after.\n\nThe second assassination attempt occurred on Sept. 15 in Palm Beach, Florida at a golf course. Ryan Wesley Routh , the suspect, may have staked out the course for 12 hours. Law enforcement officials said that Routh got close to Trump but didn't have a clear line of sight of the former president. They also said that a Secret Service agent spotted Routh's rifle through a fence and immediately opened fire, at which point the suspect fled. On September 16, Routh was charged with two firearms counts.\n\nGiven the two candidates' wildly different politics, the competition turned nasty at times, with Trump questioning Harris' race and continuing a pattern of misogynistic comments toward female opponents.\n\nIn terms of the economy, a top issue for many voters, Trump promised to extend his hallmark 2017 tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips. He also threatened broad 10 to 20% tariffs on imported goods , which economists predicted would fuel inflation.\n\nTrump's views on abortion were a sticky subject in the post-Roe environment. He took credit for overturning Roe v. Wade during the race but tempered his stance to appeal to rising pro-choice sentiment. Trump said that states should decide the laws around abortion and didn't publicly supported a federal ban. In August, Trump said that the federal government should pay for costly IVF treatments .\n\nTrump criticized Israel's actions in Gaza at times but portrayed himself as a strong defender of the Israeli state and hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. A temporary cease-fire between Israel and Gaza went into effect days before Trump took office for the second time.\n\nWith respect to the war in Ukraine, Trump repeatedly said he could end the war on Day One , though did not do so on his first day in office. He avoided explicitly saying that he wants Ukraine to win during the campaign.\n\nDonald Trump's legal troubles stretch back to the very beginning of his business career. In 1973, the US Justice Department sued Fred and Donald Trump for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act in various New York City apartment buildings. The parties settled the suit two years later and the Trumps did not admit to any wrongdoing.\n\nTrump's political rise is backlit by controversy as well, from the personal scandals that have plagued his candidacies to his new status as the first former president convicted of a federal crime . The FBI investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election , but ultimately concluded that there wasn't sufficient evidence to prove that \"members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.\" Yet the report did find \"numerous links\" between the two groups.\n\nWhile in office during his first term, Trump was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, but the Senate acquitted him both times.\n\nThe chamber first impeached him in 2019 on articles charging him with abuses of power and obstruction of justice. He is accused of offering Ukraine a quid-quo-pro: dig up dirt on Biden in exchange for military aid.\n\nThe second impeachment articles relate to his ongoing efforts to overturn the 2020 election and actions on January 6, 2021 , when a violent mob stormed the Capitol. As lawmakers convened to certify the election results, Trump encouraged his supporters to attend a rally in DC to protest the joint session of Congress. Thousands showed up, including some from white supremacist groups and right-wing militias.\n\nWhen speaking to the crowd, Trump did not explicitly call for violence, but encouraged his followers to \"fight like hell\" - many of those same followers stormed the Capitol moments later, overwhelming police and forcing lawmakers to flee. Five people died during or shortly after the event, including a Capitol police officer.\n\nCongress reconvened to certify the election results in the early hours of January 7 and Biden was inaugurated on January 20, 2021. Meanwhile, Trump continues to deny that he lost the election in 2020 , refusing to admit defeat.\n\nAfter he left office, an avalanche of lawsuits against Trump piled up, many of which are stalled or are no longer being pursued after the election.\n\nThe former president has been charged in four criminal cases: a federal election interference case, a classified documents case, a Georgia election interference case, and a hush-money case. Trump had used money from two of his PACs to pay his legal fees.\n\nIn the federal election interference case , special prosecutor Jack Smith accused Trump of engaging in a broad effort to undermine Biden's 2020 win. Smith argued that Trump amplified false claims about voter fraud , pressured elected officials, and organized fake electors. He dropped the case after the 2024 election, but filed a report shortly before the inauguration saying that Trump would have been convicted if he hadn't won another term.\n\nSmith also led the charge on a federal case accusing Trump of storing sensitive national security documents at Mar-a-Lago after removing them from the White House, and impeding the government from retrieving the documents. A Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed the case over highly controversial allegations that Smith's special counsel appointment was unconstitutional , a finding Smith's office appealed. The case was also ultimately dismissed after the election.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, Trump was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments made to Stormy Daniels , a porn star who alleges she had an affair with Trump. With the guilty verdict, Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nOn January 10, 2025, the judge in that case sentenced Trump , cementing his felon status. The president did not receive any punishment, but the decision set off a new slate of legal questions, as Trump has pledged to appeal his criminal conviction.\n\nGeorgia's election interference case focused specifically on Trump's alleged attempts to overturn Biden's win in the state. District Attorney Fani Willis charged Trump and allies in August of 2023, though the case shrunk in scope and a judge dismissed several counts against Trump . The case was mired in scandals involving Willis' personal life , and her team was eventually disqualified. Willis is appealing the decision, which could take months. If Willis wins the appeal, she'll have to wait until Trump finishes his second term to re-start the case.\n\nIn addition to the criminal trials, a jury found Trump guilty of sexual abuse in a civil case brought by E. Jean Carroll . The saga, which has extended over two suits, related to Carroll's allegation that Trump raped her in a Manhattan department store and subsequently made defamatory statements. Together, they resulted in a verdict granting Carroll damages of $88.3 million. Trump appealed the cases but a jury upheld one of the verdicts in December, 2025 . A spokesperson for Trump told BI he plans to keep appealing the verdict, which could keep the $5 million that Trump owes Carroll through that case frozen.\n\nAn ubiquitous presence in American life since the 1980s, Trump floated running for president since his early days as a businessman. People generally didn't take him seriously, and his political affiliations flip-flopped - he went from being a registered Democrat, to a registered Republican, to the front man for a remade American conservatism.\n\nIn 2012, Trump gained prominence in Republican circles for popularizing the \"birther\" theory - the racist and false claim that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. And in the summer of 2015, the prospect of a Trump presidential bid became much more real when he announced his candidacy at a campaign rally in New York City.\n\nThroughout the 2016 campaign, Trump positioned himself as a political outsider and built his platform around economic prosperity, immigration, and a newly combative rhetoric. His campaign was mired in controversy - from the Access Hollywood tape where he bragged about groping women to his failure to quickly denounce the KKK - but he appealed to a wide swath of Americans.\n\nDespite doing poorly in the early Iowa caucus, Trump triumphed in a series of primary wins and had a strong performance on Super Tuesday. After becoming the Republican nominee, Trump trailed Hillary Clinton in the polls but ended up victorious on November 8, 2016. He lost the popular vote by more than 2.8 million but won 304 electoral votes to Clinton's 227.\n\nOnce in the White House, Trump was quick to issue a slate of executive orders based on his campaign promises, including building a wall on the southern border and implementing his proposed \"Muslim ban,\" which quickly faced legal challenges.\n\nWhile running for office, Trump promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but doing so proved difficult and contentious, so he instead chipped away at the law. He also repealed many Obama-era environmental policies and withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement because he said it damaged the economy.\n\nTrump took an isolationist approach to foreign policy, imposing tariffs and withdrawing from revising long-standing trade agreements. On the economy, Trump pushed a $1.5 trillion tax cut package through Congress. Regarding the Supreme Court, he appointed three conservative judges and took credit for overturning Roe v. Wade .\n\nBy his final years in office, Trump was both president and candidate - he launched his reelection bid in June 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic upended both the election and spelled the end of Trump's presidency. President Joe Biden had accused him throughout the election of ignoring the crisis. Trump came down with COVID-19 himself during the final weeks of the campaign and received treatment at Walter Reed Medical Center.\n\nWhen election day finally rolled around, Trump eventually lost both the popular and Electoral College votes. The race was extremely close in key states and took days to call. Trump declared victory one day after the election, before all the votes were tallied, and thus inaugurated his months-long campaign contesting the election results.\n\nAfter leaving office in January 2021, Trump and Melania moved to Mar-a-Lago, where he has lived since leaving the White House.\n\nDonald Trump has a marital history marked by various divorces and alleged affairs.\n\nHe met his first wife, Czech model Ivana Marie Zelníčková, in 1976 when she was in New York City for a fashion show. The two got married in 1977 and remained a fixture of the city's tabloid scene. They had three children together: Ivanka , Donald Jr., and Eric.\n\nRumors about Trump having affairs swirled throughout the marriage, including with American actor Marla Maples. Ivana and Trump divorced in 1992.\n\nOne year later, Maples had Trump's fourth child, Tiffany. The couple got married two months later but split up in 1999.\n\nTrump's current wife, Melania Trump (née Knauss), is a Slovenian-American former model whom he met in 1998 at a mutual friend's party. The two dated on and off before tying the knot in 2004 at Mar-a-Lago. The star-studded guest list included the Clintons and Billy Joel.\n\nTrump's fifth child, Barron Trump , was born in 2006. When Trump moved into the White House, Melania and Barron waited months before joining him at the residence.\n\nIn addition to his five children, Trump has 10 grandkids . The oldest, Kai, has already stepped onto the political scene and even spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention.\n\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in the Queens borough of New York City . At 78 years old, he was the oldest person to run for president . Compared to other former presidents, Trump has released relatively little information on his physical health.\n\nIn November 2023, his personal physician said measures of his physical health were within the normal range but did not provide details about his medication, blood pressure, or cholesterol. Standing at a reported height of 6 feet 3 inches, some have expressed concern about Trump's weight in the past.\n\nHis parents, real estate developer Fred Trump and Mary MacLeod, met at a party and got married in 1936. They had five children, with Donald Trump being their fourth. He attended a Presbyterian church as a child but doesn't appear to regularly attend church services.\n\nFred Trump made much of his fortune in New York City real estate and was the subject of a US Senate investigation related to taking advantage of a federal loan program.\n\nAs a teenager, Donald Trump attended New York Military Academy, a private military school. After graduating, he attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years before eventually switching to the Wharton School of Finance and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. Trump graduated from Wharton with a bachelor's degree in economics and talks about his time at the prestigious institution often.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Trump began working for his father and eventually became the president of a collection of family-owned companies that he later turned into the Trump Organization . Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Trump expanded his father's business and invested in Manhattan hotels. He was buoyed along by financial and social help from his father, whose New York connections ran deep.\n\nIn 1983, Trump opened Trump Tower on 56th Street and 5th Avenue, where he later had an apartment. That same decade, Trump started investing in casinos and bought Mar-a-Lago , his resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe 1990s recession harmed Trump's businesses and he was forced to sell various assets, as well as commit to a personal budget. His luck largely changed by the end of the 1990s, though his casinos continued to struggle.\n\nTrump profited from his name throughout his long business career, selling everything from branded cologne and steaks to putting his name on an online education company. In 2018, The New York Times published a lengthy investigation detailing how Fred Trump funneled money to his son. The outlet reported Donald Trump received the equivalent of $413 million from his dad by the early 2000s. (Trump declined the Times's request for comment on the article at the time; a Trump spokesman at the time said there had been no fraud or tax evasion.)\n\nIn 1996, Trump teamed up with NBC to buy the Miss Universe Organization, which encompasses the Miss Universe, Miss USA , and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. Trump then starred in a reality television show of his own - \" The Apprentice .\" The Emmy-nominated program made him nearly $200 million over 16 years and boosted his image as a self-made billionaire.\n\nTrump's net worth was $3.8 billion as of September 2024, according to Forbes's calculations.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump admitted the US is in a 'period of transition' but didn't rule out the possibility of a recession\n\nPresident Donald Trump downplayed economic uncertainty over his tariffs , saying a \"period of transition\" is headed for the US economy as it adjusts. But he notably did not rule out a recession in the near future.\n\nTrump paused his 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada earlier this week, just after they went into effect. In an interview on the Fox News show \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Trump said he paused his planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada to help American car manufacturers and \"to a certain extent,\" to help both countries. Trump paused the tariffs until April 2.\n\n\"I wanted to help the American car makers until April 2,\" Trump said on Fox. \"April 2, it becomes all reciprocal. What they charge us, we charge them.\"\n\nAfter a strong start to the year, the stock market has seen significant volatility in recent weeks. This week, the market saw considerable uncertainty , with the S&P 500 down as much as 2% on Thursday following tariff concerns.\n\nStill, Trump downplayed fears over a possible recession in the Fox interview. When asked if he expected a recession in 2025, Trump responded: \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America.\"\n\n\"It takes a little time,\" he added.\n\nTrump also avoided questions about providing clarity for publicly owned businesses about how his tariffs could disrupt the economy.\n\n\"They have plenty of clarity,\" he said. \"They just use that. That's like, almost a sound bite. They always say that, 'we want clarity,'\" Trump told Fox about business asking for economic clarity.\n\nTrump paused tariffs impacting US auto manufacturers on March 5 after Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors called the president requesting a reprieve. When pressed by Fox about what \"automakers are going to do for a month\" while the tariffs are paused, Trump said that this is a \"transition period.\"\n\n\"I said, 'look, I'm going to do it this one time, but after that, I'm not doing it,'\" Trump told Fox. \"They called me and they wanted help during this little transition period, and I gave it to them.\"\n\nEconomists are still grappling with the impact of Trump's tariffs , which some economists say will increase inflation. Some analysts say that Trump's tariffs will not help increase manufacturing in the United States.\n\n\"Tariffs will not increase US manufacturing: technology, rather than trade, has been primarily responsible for the fifty-year decline in manufacturing jobs,\" John Veroneau, a former deputy US trade representative, wrote in a February 11 post on the Council on Foreign Relations website.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump declares he's interviewing law firms for his E. Jean Carroll appeal, and it's giving 'Apprentice' vibes\n\nDonald Trump appears to be treating his planned appeal in the second E. Jean Carroll defamation case like his former reality TV show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nThe former president announced late Tuesday in a game show-like fashion on his social-media platform, Truth Social: \"I am in the process, along with my team, of interviewing various law firms to represent me\" in his appeal of the recent jury verdict that ordered him to pay a whopping $83.3 million to Carroll for defaming her.\n\nIn his post, Trump called the case \"one of the most ridiculous and unfair Witch Hunts our Country has ever seen\" as he again bashed US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over the Manhattan trial, calling him \"Trump hating\" and a \"bully.\"\n\nTrump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, promised that he would soon decide which law firm would represent him for his appeal in the case.\n\n\"This entire HOAX is a disgrace to our American System of Justice. Any lawyer who takes a TRUMP CASE is either 'CRAZY,' or a TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT. I will make my decision soon!\" Trump said in the post.\n\nAttorney Alina Habba was the lead attorney representing Trump in Carroll's second defamation trial against the former president, along with her law partner Michael Madaio at Habba Madaio & Associates, this month.\n\nJoe Tacopina , a more experienced defense attorney, worked alongside Habba and Madaio as he led Trump's defense in a separate trial from Carroll last year, which ended in a $5 million jury verdict that found Trump liable for sexual abuse and defamation . Tacopina withdrew from Trump's legal team shortly before the second trial began.\n\nThat left Habba in charge of defending Trump for his second trial, which resulted in a considerably higher jury verdict. While Kaplan appeared to respect Tacopina even as he frequently ruled against Trump - once even calling him, on the record, \"a heck of a good lawyer\" - Habba repeatedly frustrated Kaplan during the later trial. The judge rebuked her at least 14 times in a single day over basic law and courtroom procedures.\n\nEven though Trump is shopping around for new attorneys to represent him in his appeal of the massive verdict, Habba is still \"very much representing President Trump,\" a spokesperson for Habba told Business Insider on Wednesday.\n\n\"Bringing in an appellate specialist is common practice in litigation and comparing a trial lawyer and an appellate lawyer is similar to comparing a brain surgeon and a heart surgeon,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nLegal experts agreed, telling Business Insider that it's common for people to use different lawyers on appeal.\n\n\"It's totally normal, indeed expected, that a client who needs to appeal on the losing end of things, would want a fresh set of eyes to reevaluate any issues on appeal,\" Mark Bederow, a criminal defense lawyer and former Manhattan prosecutor, said.\n\nBut Trump has used Habba's law firm in earlier appeals related to the case.\n\nCarroll's defamation lawsuit was first filed in 2019, after Trump called her a liar when she accused him of sexual abuse, and bounced around appeals courts in New York and Washington, DC, for years as lawyers and judges vexed over questions of whether Trump could be held liable in a civil lawsuit for statements he made while serving as president.\n\nIn a high-stakes appellate court hearing in October, which Business Insider attended, Madaio argued before a three-judge panel that Trump should have immunity in the lawsuit.\n\nJudge Kaplan had previously ruled that Trump waived immunity because he failed to raise it as a defense for three years, and because his denials of Carroll's accusations about a sexual assault that happened in the 1990s weren't related to his role as president anyway.\n\nHabba did not personally attend the appellate hearing. Carroll, who did attend, was represented in the proceedings by Joshua Matz, a former Supreme Court clerk who works at Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP, the same law firm that represented her in both trials.\n\nThe appellate court ultimately upheld Kaplan's ruling and allowed the lawsuit to proceed.\n\nNeama Rahmani, an attorney and former federal prosecutor, explained that appellate lawyers \"have a different skill set\" like \"looking for legal errors rather than arguing to a jury.\"\n\nTrump, Rahmani said, \"probably realizes that he lost the second Carroll trial so badly in part due to Alina Habba's limited trial experience and that he needs experienced appellate counsel.\"\n\n\"The question is,\" he said, \"are any of them willing to take on an appeal they will likely lose?\"\n\nThe first of Carroll's trials against Trump was for a lawsuit that had been filed in 2022 and moved more quickly because it was over statements made after he had left the presidency. Judge Kaplan said that the second trial could not re-litigate elements already decided in the first trial, frustrating Trump and his lawyers who sought to discredit Carroll in front of a second jury. The judge, conscious of Trump's intent to appeal the second trial results, told as much to Trump in the courtroom before he testified.\n\n\"It is a very well-established legal principle in this country that prevents do-overs by disappointed litigants,\" the judge said.\n\nMeanwhile, Bederow called it \"almost unfathomable\" that any attorney would willingly represent Trump \"knowing that he is an uncontrollable client.\"\n\n\"He's going to do whatever he wants,\" Bederow said of Trump. \"He's going to make a spectacle. He's going to storm out of the courtroom in the middle of proceedings , which is just bonkers.\"\n\n\"And the reality is everyone, especially lawyers, who touches his legal proceedings,\" he said, \"tends to end up diminished in some capacity - humiliated, indicted , potentially imprisoned, ridiculed.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "3 days in, Trump is backtracking on his tariffs on Mexico and Canada\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday said that he's granting a one-month tariffs pause to a range of Mexican and Canadian goods , just days after imposing 25% tariffs on imports from the two neighboring nations.\n\nTrump announced a one-month pause for some Mexican goods on Truth Social. After some uncertainty, he later granted Canada a reprieve as well.\n\n\"This is a modification for our tariff regime to protect car manufacturers and American farmers,\" Will Scharf, the White House staff secretary, told Trump before he signed the executive orders.\n\nAs part of the Canadian-related executive order, Trump also reduced the tariff on potash, a key ingredient in fertilizer that the US overwhelmingly imports from Canada. Potash will now be tariffed at 10% as opposed to the initial overall 25% for all goods.\n\nThe White House's Thursday reprieves come just a day after Trump handed automakers their own pause.\n\n\"After speaking with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico, I have agreed that Mexico will not be required to pay Tariffs on anything that falls under the USMCA Agreement,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This Agreement is until April 2nd. I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum.\"\n\nThe USMCA, a trade deal negotiated between the US, Mexico, and Canada during Trump's first term as a replacement for the NAFTA trade pact, exempts most goods that are produced in the three signatory countries from most tariffs.\n\nTrump's newest pause dovetails with the White House's efforts to calm markets. Shares on Wall Street tanked after Trump decided to forge ahead on Tuesday with his latest round of tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China. Markets rebounded on Wednesday as traders anticipated a reduction in the tariffs would be forthcoming.\n\nStocks slid on Thursday, with weakness in tech and tariff concerns bringing the S&P 500 down as much as 2% in afternoon trading.\n\nIt remains to be seen how Wall Street will respond to the latest pause.\n\nThe White House has said the first round of tariffs is based on Trump's frustration with the nations failing to do more to stop the spread of fentanyl. Leaders of all three countries have disputed that claim.\n\nThe White House said the Big 3 US automakers - General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis - requested the earlier exemption for cars. That exemption applies to Canadian auto imports as well. At the time, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was open to cutting further deals.\n\nAnother round of tariffs targeting foreign agricultural goods and other products is set to go into effect on April 2. During his joint address to Congress, Trump mentioned South Korea, India, and the European Union as potential targets to even out what he views as unfair trade relations.\n\nChina and Canada immediately responded to Tuesday's announcement with retaliatory tariffs . Mexico was originally set to implement its measures on Sunday.\n\nBeijing has taken particular exception to Trump's actions. China's US embassy wrote on X that it was ready for a \"war\" of any kind.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Why you should be careful about copying Trump's take-no-prisoners leadership style\n\nIf you live in Canada or Mexico or you're a government worker , you might consider it the art of the raw deal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's approach to leadership and negotiation - more pugilistic than pluralistic - has allowed for what he sees as quick wins in trade spats with America's closest neighbors , looming cuts in the federal workforce under Elon Musk's direction, and the rollback of back diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.\n\nOnly weeks into Trump's second term, the allure of the president's at times brash style is likely to embolden some corporate leaders fed up with return-to-office fights , discussions about DEI, and flagging worker engagement to adopt a brass-knuckles approach of their own, leadership experts told Business Insider.\n\nBut they said that shifting into Trump mode could come at a cost.\n\n\"Donald Trump's brand harkens back to an older time in America,\" said Erik Helzer, a core faculty member of the Center for Innovative Leadership at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School.\n\nHe added that the president's leadership style pointed to \"an older understanding of how to lead.\"\n\nOne problem with following in his footsteps: Leaders' shoes may not be big enough.\n\n\"A small number may be successful at imitating it,\" said Brian Ott, a distinguished professor of communication at Missouri State University, \"but the vast majority of people don't have the kind of power that Elon Musk and Donald Trump have.\"\n\nElizabeth Lotardo, the author of the book \"Leading Yourself,\" told BI that leaders tempted to replicate the president's muscular stance should consider, among other things, the timelines they face.\n\n\"The trap is to view the time horizon as similar,\" she said. \"Donald Trump is playing a four-year game. CEOs, the good ones anyway, are hopefully looking at a longer-term horizon.\"\n\nHelzer said Trump's approach would likely trickle down into corporate America, though he added that some CEOs would buck such a trend.\n\nHigh-profile companies, including JPMorgan and Apple, have defended their companies' work around DEI, for example.\n\nLotardo said the president's move to force the roughly half of federal workers who can do their jobs remotely to go to an office five days a week could ultimately be a Pyrrhic victory: It could achieve the goal of thinning government payrolls but also drain expertise and make it harder for the government to innovate if top talent flees.\n\nHelzer said Trump's stance on trade seemed designed to be provocative and follow the negotiation principle of \"make the first offer.\" Doing so, he added, means subsequent offers are anchored to the first.\n\n\"From the standpoint of trying to gain the upper hand in negotiation, there may be some strategy associated with that,\" Helzer said.\n\nThat's how the White House sees it.\n\n\"President Trump, a master negotiator, is strategically leveraging his skills to fulfill the promises that earned him a resounding mandate from the American people,\" Harrison Fields, a principal deputy press secretary, said in a statement to BI.\n\nIndeed, Trump has said that dealmaking is his art .\n\n\"Other people paint beautifully or write poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals,\" Trump tweeted in 2014. \"That's how I get my kicks.\"\n\nOtt told BI that Trump often demonstrated \"rulership\" rather than leadership.\n\n\"Leadership requires, by definition, followership,\" which involves people voluntarily doing things without coercion, Ott said. \"Real leadership is leading and building consensus.\"\n\nTrump, he said, \"has no interest in consensus building.\"\n\nDescribing Trump's recent trade moves, Helzer said, \"He will get people to acquiesce, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're partnering.\"\n\nOtt said that even though the president and supporters like Musk, newly installed as a \" special government employee ,\" appeared to be getting what they want, leaders who try to copy the Trump playbook might find they fall short.\n\nMaria DeLorenzis Reyes, an executive-leadership coach who said she has worked with more than 1,600 companies, said that while Trump's approach to trade with Canada and Mexico, for example, might seem to some observers to be one of strength, she didn't see it that way.\n\n\"It models this leadership style that's completely opposite to what's needed,\" DeLorenzis Reyes said.\n\nShe described Trump's methods as a throwback to a command-and-control style of leadership that was more popular three or four decades ago but that ultimately isn't as effective as inspiring people about an idea. She said that using fear as a cudgel could reduce quality work, collaboration, and innovation.\n\n\"Leadership that marginalizes or disrespects members of teams hinders an organization's ability to actually operate and be productive,\" DeLorenzis Reyes said.\n\nIn her experience, she said, some corporate leaders appeared to talk a good game about concepts they might view as squishy, like empathy and connecting with workers. In some cases that extended to corporate DEI programs that mushroomed after the 2020 killing of George Floyd, and even flexibility in how workers got their jobs done after the pandemic.\n\nNow, DeLorenzis Reyes said, Trump's tone is giving some permission to consider walking away from things they perhaps felt forced into in recent years.\n\nA reversion to \"Mad Men\"-era leadership might work now that it's harder for many desk workers to find a job than it was a few years ago. But she said that in the longer term, when the pendulum of power swings back toward workers, harder-line leaders could get pinched when it comes to attracting skilled workers.\n\nMeanwhile, for some CEOs, reverting to an old-school leadership style and less touchy-feely management techniques is a return to their comfort zones.\n\nDeLorenzis Reyes said these executives \"never really bought into\" these more recent ways of working. \"They just wanted to get back to the way things were.\"\n\nJump to"

(Some NBC News employees are members of The NewsGuild-CWA.)\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to return the agency and its employees, contractors, and grantees to their status before Trump signed an order dismantling the agency.\n\nU.S. Agency for Global Media, the agency's acting director Victor Morales, and  adviser for the agency Kari Lake, were named as defendants in the lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York.

Several of those events in Western states featured Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nEnergy was indeed high at Kim's event, where the crowd appeared mostly supportive of the senator, praising in particular his opposition to a Republican funding bill despite other Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, helping advance the measure before it passed.\n\n\"I still strongly disagree with Sen. Schumer in terms of that approach,\" Kim said to loud cheers from the crowd.\n\nOne attendee asked when Congress is \"going to take equal balance or power from this executive branch\", pointing to Trump's effort to eliminate the Department of Education this week despite the need for lawmakers to pass legislation to that effect.\n\n\"They know that they cannot do that without Congress's approval, and we are mobilizing that way,\" Kim said. \"I will tell you, I will do everything I humanly can to be able to stop them from gutting our Department Education.\"\n\nKim told NBC News that Democrats must provide a roadmap for people looking to \"fight back\" against Trump's agenda.\n\n\"One thing I'm taking away from today is people want us to show our own plan, be able to have our own budget up against the Republican budget. Say, 'Here is a budget that we are putting forward that is about protecting health care, protecting Medicaid, protecting the students, protecting people who are vulnerable,'\" Kim said.\n\n\"I think that'll help us be able to show not just what we're against and what we're trying to stop, but what our vision for this country is,\" he added.\n\nBen Kamisar\n\nAs the public face of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk has an expansive portfolio that spans across the many levers of government - and that could intersect with his wide range of business interests.\n\nBut unlike another high-profile \"special government employee\" working in Trump's White House, AI and crypto czar David Sacks , there's no evidence that Musk has obtained a conflict of interest waiver. Such a waiver would outline the steps he's taken to avoid overlaps between his business interests and his government work, include an explanation from the White House counsel about why they feel comfortable with Musk's arrangement, and it would identify areas where Musk has the green light to weigh in despite his business holdings.\n\nInstead, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Musk has already pledged he'd avoid potential conflicts of interest and like all Trump-appointed \"special government employees,\" he's \"abiding by all applicable laws.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nJulia Ainsley\n\nZoë Richards\n\nNearly all of the employees working in the Department of Homeland Security's civil rights division were fired, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to NBC News today.\n\nThe spokesperson said the offices \"have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS's mission.\"\n\n\"Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"DHS remains committed to civil rights protections but must streamline oversight to remove roadblocks to enforcement. These reductions ensure taxpayer dollars support the Department's core mission: border security and immigration enforcement.\"\n\nThe firings were first reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe fired employees had worked to investigate allegations of civil rights abuses of citizens and immigrants by DHS personnel, including Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests and conditions in CBP and ICE facilities.\n\nNnamdi Egwuonwu\n\nTrump expressed confidence at the White House this afternoon that the war in Ukraine will imminently reach an end despite Russian President Vladimir Putin not yet agreeing to a ceasefire proposal negotiated in part by the U.S.\n\n\"We had a couple of good conversations today, and maybe we can get that death march stopped as soon as possible,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what conversations Trump was referencing, but earlier this week he spoke to both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump revealed after his call with Putin on Tuesday that the Russian leader agreed to temporarily pause attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\n\nPutin, however, declined to immediately accept the 30-day ceasefire proposal endorsed by Trump and accepted by Zelenskyy . The president told reporters today that he did not give Putin a deadline to accept the ceasefire proposal, but Trump was confident an agreement would be reached.\n\n\"I think we'll have one,\" Trump said. \"They're going at it pretty heavy right now, as you probably saw both of them, but I think we'll have it done fairly soon.\"\n\nDuring an event with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth today, Trump said the \"confines of a deal\" for a full ceasefire are in place.\n\n\"I believe we're going to pretty soon have a full ceasefire, and then we're going to have a contract. And the contract's being negotiated, the contract in terms of dividing up the lands, etc, etc. It's being negotiated as we speak,\" he said.\n\nLaura Strickler\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has identified more than 100 federal advisory committees that it has \"scheduled to be terminated,\" including panels that advise on infant and maternal mortality, organ transplants, blood products, sickle cell disease and cancer research.\n\nThe move is in response to an executive order from Trump that seeks to reduce the size of the \"federal bureaucracy.\" The committees targeted are not mandated by Congress but provide a forum for medical experts and scientists to get together and advise the agency on health care policy.\n\nThe full list of advisory committees was obtained by NBC News.\n\nAn email sent to agency staff this afternoon asked employees to indicate if any of the committees were \"absolutely necessary\" and if so, to describe the specific administrative priority being met, why the committee is essential, whether it is in the public interest, and confirm that the agency head agrees that the committee should not be terminated.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nMaya Rosenberg Maya Rosenberg is a Desk Assistant based in Washington, D.C.\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nOne of the deportees sent to El Salvador on a finding he was a member of a Venezuelan gang wasn't Venezuelan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs said in court today.\n\nLee Gelernt of the ACLU, one of the attorneys for Venezuelan nationals combating Trump's efforts to deport them using the wartime Alien Enemies Act, said he would be submitting a court filing alleging the government made numerous mistakes with its deportation flights on Saturday.\n\nHe said several of the deportees were sent back to the U.S. after being taken to El Salvador, which had agreed to imprison alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. One of those returned was not actually Venezuelan, Gelernt said.\n\nOthers were women, which the country had refused to take, the attorney said.\n\nDuring the hearing, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg continued to press the government for details about the timing of the flights.\n\nHe'd ordered during an emergency hearing Saturday that any flights deporting people using the AEA should immediately return to the U.S. Lawyers for the DOJ have said the planes were outside of U.S. airspace at the time. The department has not yet responded to the judge's request for a detailed explanation on the timing of the flights, and he has directed it to submit a filing next week explaining whether it ignored his order to return.\n\n\"I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my order, who ordered this, and what the consequences will be,\" the judge said.\n\nChloe Atkins\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nSydney Carruth Sydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News.\n\nTrump's Justice Department filed a motion seeking to disqualify U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell from presiding over a case challenging a Trump-issued executive order that targets prominent Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie for its past legal work.\n\nThe DOJ motion comes after Howell granted the law firm's request for a temporary restraining order that sought to prevent parts of Trump's executive order, which the firm argues is designed to punish its lawyers for their work investigating Trump's link to Russia during the 2016 election cycle on behalf of the Democratic opposition, from taking effect.\n\nIn granting the temporary restraining order, Howell said the executive order \"threatens the very foundation of our legal system\" by punishing lawyers for doing work the administration deems unfavorable to its image.\n\nNow, the DOJ wants Howell off the case, alleging \"this Court has repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President.\"\n\nThe DOJ said examples of the U.S. district court's partiality include \"enabling the improper efforts of disgraced former prosecutor Jack Smith\" in selecting the D.C. court as the venue for what would have been Trump's trial over his alleged incitement of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and \"wrongly suggesting in public that President Trump is an authoritarian.\"\n\nThe Justice Department added, \"This Court's comments at the hearing on the meritless motion for a temporary restraining order in this case, including gratuitous and biased references by this Court regarding the investigation of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, confirm that reasonable observers may view this Court as incapable of fairly adjudicating these claims against the Commander-In-Chief.\"\n\nThe DOJ demanded the case be transferred to a different district court judge who \"has not demonstrated a pattern of hostility towards Defendants.\"\n\nSyedah Asghar\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was grilled by town hall attendees today about the congressional response to sweeping policy changes from the administration. The town hall was in Franklin County, Iowa, this morning, with over 120 people in attendance, according to an X post by the lawmaker,\n\nIn a clip posted by the Des Moines Register , one attendee asked: \"Where is Congress?\" while sharing frustrations about Elon Musk trying \"to ruin the country.\"\n\n\"There are 535 members of Congress. There's only one president. It's a 535 to one,\" said the attendee before receiving applause. \"When does Congress act? When does your committee on the Judiciary Committee send a subpoena to Elon Musk?\"\n\nThe lively audience interrupted Grassley multiple times, with one attendee saying, \"That's not happening\" when the senator said only Cabinet members can execute Trump's decisions, not Musk.\n\nWhen Grassley said the \"buck stops in the Oval Office,\" an attendee fired back: \"Does the buck stop with Charles Grassley?\"\n\nWhen leaving the town hall, a few constituents booed the senator.\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nChloe Atkins\n\nSeveral federal judges expressed frustration this week with how Trump's administration is pushing forward his sweeping agenda, as the president and his allies got even more aggressive in their criticism of the judiciary.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner\n\nThe General Services Administration is launching a new artificial intelligence tool for government use, designed to support staff at the agency in their regular, daily work, with the goal of rolling it out to other federal agencies in the near future.\n\nGSA began building the technology 18 months ago under the Biden administration, focusing on the security and privacy of the AI tool, a GSA spokesperson tells NBC News.\n\nThe decision to develop the tool internally was driven by concerns within the department about the risks of using commercially available AI tools, according to a GSA official familiar with the development of the tool. The tool was ultimately built internally to ensure it meets government security requirements.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner\n\nThe Trump administration is stepping up its review of federal agencies' contracts with consulting companies, warning in a letter to the 10 highest-paid consulting firms doing government work that they must submit scorecards justifying their contracts without using consulting \"jargon or gobbledygook,\" according to a letter obtained by NBC News.\n\nThe letter - sent by Josh Gruenbaum, who leads cost-cutting efforts at the GSA - requests new information on the companies' billions of dollars worth of government contracts, broken out by agency.\n\nEach firm that received this letter must detail their pricing structure and look for cuts that can be made using \"simple layman terms (a 15 year old should be able to understand what service you provide and why it is important),\" Gruenbaum wrote.\n\nThe letter - which came with an attached scorecard template - pits the firms against each other, saying their responses will be compared against both the governmentwide review and what is submitted by other consulting firms.\n\nThe consulting companies have been asked to detail the kind of work they have been doing and disclose how much the companies were paid by government agencies between 2019 and 2024 - and must submit this information by March 31.\n\nGSA has canceled 1,700 consulting contracts since Trump took office, according to internal data the agency provided to NBC News.\n\nMithil Aggarwal\n\nThe U.S. denied allegations that a French scientist was turned away at the border over his political beliefs.\n\nPhilippe Baptiste, the French minister of higher education and research, said the unidentified researcher was denied entry to the U.S. earlier this month while traveling to a conference near Houston.\n\nU.S. authorities found his phone \"contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration's research policies,\" Baptiste said in a statement.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said that was \"not true.\"\n\n\"The French researcher in question was in possession of confidential information on his electronic device from Los Alamos National Laboratory,\" in violation of a nondisclosure agreement, she wrote on X last night, \"something he admitted to taking without permission and attempted to conceal.\"\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., are demanding information from the Defense Department about Elon Musk's meeting this morning at the Pentagon .\n\n\"Did the Pentagon today provide Mr. Musk with a top-secret briefing today on U.S. war plans for China?\" Warren and Duckworth asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in a letter obtained exclusively by NBC News.\n\nThey sought additional details about the briefing, including whether the Pentagon changed its original plans for the meeting after initial public reports came out about it. The two senators also asked what clearance processes were in place for Musk to receive the information that he did.\n\n\"Mr. Musk arrived at the Pentagon earlier today. But it remains unclear exactly what information he received, and whether you or other Pentagon officials modified plans for him to receive top-secret information \"on the U.S. military's plan for any war that might break out with China,\" they wrote in the letter, quoting an article by The New York Times , which was first to report on Musk's briefing.\n\nThe Times reported last night that Musk was set to receive a briefing today on U.S. plans for any war with China. Three defense officials told NBC News that the briefing would include a discussion about China, but could not confirm it would delve into any war plans. Two of the officials said the briefing would be be unclassified.\n\nTrump and Hegseth both denied the reports, saying Musk came to the Pentagon to discuss his efforts to cut government costs under the so-called Department of Government Efficiency initiative. They said this morning that the meeting did not include information about any war plans for China.\n\nAdam Edelman\n\nThe complaint filed by a bipartisan coalition alleging that a political group affiliated with Elon Musk violated state campaign finance laws as part of its spending efforts in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race will move forward.\n\nFollowing a preliminary review, the Wisconsin Ethics Commission found that the complaint was \"sufficient to proceed to consideration by the Commission,\" according to an email from the commission obtained by NBC News.\n\nAccording to Wisconsin statutes , that effectively means that the commission found the complaint to contain \"sufficient allegations to establish that a violation\" of certain Wisconsin campaign finance laws \"has potentially occurred.\"\n\nThe complaint was filed earlier this week by longtime Wisconsin Republican activist Tracy Mangold with the support of a Democratic strategist-led group that's focused on supporting the party's legal efforts around election protection. It alleged that Building America's Future violated campaign finance laws in failing to properly disclose various expenditures and disbursements related to the \"Progress 2028\" campaign.\n\nIn response to questions about the development, Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Building America's Future, referred to a post he wrote on X on Tuesday, calling the complaint \"laughable\" and that it was \"unsurprising that Democrats are throwing a hissy fit\" about the group \"simply telling voters what Susan Crawford's positions are.\"\n\n\"We're not the slightest bit concerned and don't plan on relenting,\" Romeo wrote in the post.\n\nThe complaint is related to a series of digital ads put out by a group identifying itself as Progress 2028 that have tied Crawford, a liberal candidate in the technically nonpartisan race to a variety of liberal policy ideas. Some ads, for example, call Crawford a \"progressive champion,\" while others contend she will \"stand up for immigrants\" and give convicted criminals \"second chances.\"\n\nThe Associated Press and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel have reported that the ads, which appear largely on Facebook and other social media sites, were funded by Building America's Future, a Musk-aligned group. (Building America's Future isn't required to disclose its donations, but Reuters and The Wall Street Journal have reported that Musk helped fund it in the past.) The group is one of two associated with Musk - the other is Musk's America PAC - that have together spent millions to boost the conservative candidate in the race, Brad Schimel.\n\nThe complaint specifically alleged that Building America's Future hasn't properly disclosed the disbursements to fund the campaign - known as express advocacy disbursements - as would be required under Wisconsin campaign finance law.\n\nDaniel Arkin\n\nOscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone, who has long called for the federal government to open up more documents about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, refrained from immediately weighing in on the tranche of files released this week by the Trump administration.\n\n\"Oliver is holding off on commenting on anything regarding the JFK files until he's able to familiarize himself with the new materials,\" a representative for Stone said in an email to NBC News this week.\n\nStone directed the 1991 film \"JFK,\" a dizzying exploration of the conspiracy theories surrounding Kennedy's killing. The movie focuses on former New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison (played by Kevin Costner) who distrusted the Warren Commission's conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.\n\nThe director has said the movie was intended to serve as a \"counter-myth\" and a deep dive into the country's \"untold history.\" It surveys a sprawling cast of potential culprits, including the CIA, the Mafia, Cuban freedom fighters and the military-industrial complex amid the war in Vietnam.\n\nThe batch of Kennedy files released this week did not immediately appear to contain any narrative-shifting bombshells about Kennedy's killing, though some of the files reveal the 35th president's skepticism of the CIA.\n\nJennifer Jett\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to call a snap federal election on Sunday that is expected to be held on April 28, The Globe and Mail reported , with the campaign likely to be dominated by anger over Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports and calls to make Canada the 51st state .\n\nCarney has not yet made a final decision on April 28 as the election date, the newspaper reported yesterday, citing two sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss campaign plans and strategy. His office has not responded to an NBC News request for comment.\n\nCarney, the newly elected leader of Canada's governing Liberal Party, became prime minister last Friday after his predecessor and fellow Liberal, the highly unpopular Justin Trudeau, stepped down after almost a decade in power amid criticism over his response to 25% tariffs that Trump has imposed on Canadian imports.\n\nThe center-left Liberals are now in a tight race with the Conservative Party, after Trump's actions and rhetoric prompted a surge in Canadian nationalism and support for the Liberals that erased the Conservatives' double-digit lead in the polls in a matter of weeks.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nSarah Dean\n\nTrump said this afternoon that people who were deported to El Salvador by his administration went through a rigorous vetting process.\n\n\"I was told that they went through a very strong vetting process, and that that will also be continuing in El Salvador, and if there's anything like that we would certainly want to find out,\" Trump said in response to a reporter asking about reports that some who were deported weren't criminals.\n\n\"These were a bad group. This was a bad group, and they were in bad areas, and they were with a lot of other people that were absolutely killers, murderers, and people that were really bad with the worst records you've ever seen,\" Trump added. \"And, but we will continue that process, absolutely we don't want to make that kind of a mistake.\"\n\nFamilies of the Venezuelan immigrants who were recently deported say they were shocked to see their loved ones sent to a megaprison in El Salvador and deny that they have links to the Venezuelan gang known as Tren de Aragua , NBC News reported this week.\n\nSydney Carruth Sydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News.\n\nTrump criticized Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who ran as Kamala Harris' vice presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket last year, while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office this afternoon.\n\n\"He lost an election. He played a part. You know, usually a vice president doesn't play a part, they say. I think Tim played a part. I think he was so bad that he hurt her, but she hurt herself,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comments come as Walz has re-emerged on the national stage this week. The Minnesota governor returned to Wisconsin for the first time since the 2024 campaign to rally support for the Democratic candidate in the state's highly contested Supreme Court race.\n\nDuring the Wisconsin event and in an interview on California Gov. Gavin Newsom's podcast, Walz urged Democratic governors to stand up to what he called Trump's \"unconstitutional mandates.\"\n\nTrump also blamed Harris' loss in part on Joe Biden. \"Joe hurt them both. They didn't have a great group. I would probably put him at the bottom of the group,\" Trump said.\n\nAmanda Terkel Politics Managing Editor\n\nIn his Oval Office remarks, a reporter asked Trump about NBC News' reporting that Biden is eager to help the Democratic Party get back on its feet by fundraising, campaigning or whatever else is needed.\n\nTrump said he'd welcome it.\n\n\"I hope so,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump still uses his former opponent as a frequent foil. He has invoked Biden in some form more than 400 times since his Jan. 20 inauguration, according to an NBC News analysis.\n\nKatherine Doyle\n\nFollowing his executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, Trump said Friday that the Small Business Association will \"immediately\" begin overseeing student loan servicing. He also said the Department of Health and Human Services will handle nutrition programs and programs for children with disabilities.\n\nYesterday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said those areas would remain under the Education Department.\n\nCompletely eliminating the department would require the approval of Congress, and Trump has said he hopes Democrats will vote in favor.\n\nBen Kamisar\n\nAmerica PAC, the super PAC founded by billionaire Elon Musk ahead of the 2024 election, is reviving its controversial petition-gathering program to promise Wisconsin registered voters $100 if they sign its conservative-leaning petition ahead of next month's state Supreme Court race.\n\nThe new petition says signers are \"rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role,\" language that mirrors Musk and other Trump allies (as well as the president himself) who have lambasted judges they believe are stymying Trump's agenda . A post on X from the group says voters can also receive $100 for each signature that comes from their referral.\n\nAmerica PAC ran a similar petition drive in swing states ahead of the presidential election, but that drive was coupled with an entry into a $1 million raffle for signers. Philadelphia's district attorney sued Musk and the group over the sweepstakes, but was unsuccessful .\n\nIt's the latest attempt by Musk to use his virtually unlimited personal wealth to further his political aims . However, like last year's petition, the $100 only goes to people who sign the petition and is not explicitly linked to any promise to vote or to back a certain candidate or political party.\n\nJulia Ainsley\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will continue to deport immigrants to a megaprison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador if the individuals have a final order of deportation, a Homeland Security spokesperson told NBC News.\n\nThe order by Judge James Boasberg only blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants subject to Trump's presidential proclamation from the U.S. to El Salvador without final orders of removal.\n\nThe DHS spokesperson said that Venezuelan people who ICE arrested this week could face possible deportation to El Salvador if they are ordered deported by an immigration judge.\n\nThe DHS spokesperson did not say when future deportations to El Salvador may occur.\n\nSending deported immigrants to a prison in a foreign country that is not their own is unprecedented. The recent use of Guantanamo Bay was as a detention center rather than a deportation site, and immigrants there remained in the custody of the U.S.\n\nWhen immigration judges order an immigrant to be deported, they do so with the expectation they will be humanely sent back to their home country.\n\nStella Kim\n\nRoy Luo\n\nU.S. ally South Korea is struggling to remove its Department of Energy designation as a \"sensitive country\" after being added to the list in January.\n\nThe designation, which takes effect April 15, puts South Korea on the lowest tier of the watch list along with countries such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. Countries may appear on the list for national security, nuclear nonproliferation or terrorism support reasons, and they are subject to additional review before their nationals are granted access to DOE facilities, according to the department's website.\n\n\"We will negotiate toward removing South Korea from the list as much as possible, but if that doesn't work, we will create a constructive alternative,\" Ahn Duk-geun, the South Korean trade minister, told reporters yesterday upon arriving in Washington.\n\n\"We plan to find the best possible solution so that this does not become an obstacle to scientific and industrial cooperation between South Korea and the U.S.,\" he said.\n\nJoseph Yun, the acting U.S. ambassador in Seoul, said Tuesday that South Korea was added to the list because visitors to the DOE's labs mishandled sensitive information, according to Reuters. He did not elaborate on the details but said it was \"not a big deal\" and did not have broader implications for U.S.-South Korea cooperation.\n\nSydney Carruth Sydney Carruth is a digital assistant for NBC News.\n\nProtesters gathered outside a VA medical center in Saginaw, Michigan, on Thursday to oppose the Trump administration's sprawling cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe protesters held signs reading \"Keep your promise\" and \"Hands off our Veterans,\" waving and cheering as cars passed to draw attention to the thousands of VA employees who have been fired from the agency, which provides health care and other critical services to millions of veterans.\n\nCarly Rose Hammond, a member of the Saginaw City Council, told NBC 25 that now is the time for the nation to stand up for the veterans who fought for its freedoms.\n\n\"They're coming after nurses, they're coming after Medicaid, they're coming after Social Security offices. Those are people that need those services every single day - that's what we as voters voted for,\" Hammond said.\n\nAn internal memo obtained by NBC News earlier this month detailed plans to slash 80,000 jobs from the agency by August in order to \"resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.\"\n\nCritics and concerned veterans warn the cuts could be detrimental for veterans who rely on the agency for health care and other critical services.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nThe Trump administration has appealed more than 15 decisions by federal judges to circuit courts since Jan. 20.\n\nThat includes one appeal filed overnight by Elon Musk and DOGE, appealing Judge Theodore Chuang's order to reinstate USAID systems and access, to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe administration has also appealed, for example, a ruling to reinstate National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox , a Democrat, as well as another ruling to reinstate Cathy Harris, who was fired as a Democratic member of the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n\nThe government also appealed a ruling last weekend that blocked deportations using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Planes carrying deportees, however, didn't turn around and instead landed in El Salvador, appearing to defy the judge's decision. The White House has denied that if defied the judge.\n\nTrump has been railing against federal judges who have blocked actions by his administration. This morning, he wrote on Truth Social, \"No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result.

When pressed by NBC News, he said that the future of Senate Minority Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is up to the Senate.\n\n\"It truly is. ... I don't think we're in disarray. I think right now, we look like we're in disarray, but we certainly have a unifying message,\" said Subramanyam.\n\nPeter Guo\n\nReporting from Hong Kong\n\nBeijing said it welcomed a visit by Sen.

Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, is seeking information from the Securities and Exchange Commission over its decision to relax federal regulations around meme coins weeks after Trump and first lady Melania Trump released their own versions.\n\nThe SEC defines a meme coin as a type of crypto asset inspired by internet memes, characters, current events, or trends. In a staff statement last month, the agency said because of its view that meme coins are typically purchased for entertainment and social interaction rather than financial value, owners of the asset do not have to abide by federal regulations.\n\n\"Persons who participate in the offer and sale of meme coins do not need to register their transactions with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933,\" a February statement from the agency reads. \"Accordingly, neither meme coin purchasers nor holders are protected by the federal securities laws.\"\n\nIn a letter to acting SEC Chairman Mark Uyeda, Warren highlighted the financial benefits the Trumps incurred through the coins and wrote the rule change \"conveniently presents a legal interpretation that could shield the President and First Lady's coins from regulatory scrutiny.\"\n\n\"By the afternoon of January 20th, the coins were reportedly worth a combined $9.5 billion and attracted large numbers of first-time crypto investors,\" the senator added. \"Though the $TRUMP coin lost roughly two-thirds of its value within a few weeks of launch, President Trump's companies earned nearly $100 million in fees; small retail investors, meanwhile, lost money.\"\n\nWarren in the letter characterizes meme coins as \"direct threats to consumers\" that could benefit from more, not less, oversight.\n\nThe information the senator is requesting from the SEC includes \"all communications\" between the agency and the White House,\" and more specifically, whether the agency has taken directives from the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, a board formed by Trump in January that includes Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\n\"It is essential that the Commission issue policy proposals designed to benefit the American public-not the President's bottom line,\" her letter reads.\n\nJennifer Jett\n\nCourtney Kube\n\nTrump denied a New York Times report that his adviser Elon Musk is set to be briefed by the Pentagon today on the U.S. military's plan for any potential war with China.\n\n\"China will not even be mentioned or discussed,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform late last night.\n\nMusk, who is leading the Trump administration's effort to slash the size of the federal government, is scheduled to visit the Pentagon today for a meeting and briefing, three defense officials told NBC News. Two of the officials said Musk was expected to be briefed on China but that the briefing would be unclassified. None of the officials could confirm the Times report, which cited two U.S. officials.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth also denied the report, saying in a post on X that it would be \"an informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production.\"\n\nArata Yamamoto\n\nReporting from Tokyo\n\nJapan said there had been \"no change\" in plans to enhance the deterrence and response capabilities of the U.S.-Japan alliance, despite news reports that the Pentagon is considering canceling a planned expansion of U.S. forces stationed in Japan.\n\nThe move to cancel the expansion, as outlined in draft documents seen by NBC and CNN, would save about $1.18 billion, part of larger cuts to defense spending that could include restructuring the U.S. military's combatant commands and headquarters and giving up U.S. command of NATO military operations for the first time in almost 75 years.\n\nThe Japanese government's top spokesperson, Yoshimasa Hayashi, told reporters in Tokyo today that Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the expansion plan during Ishiba's visit to Washington last month.\n\nThe U.S. and its longtime ally Japan, which hosts more than 50,000 U.S. service members, have been intensifying military cooperation in recent years in an effort to address growing security threats from China and North Korea.\n\nPeter Guo\n\nReporting from Hong Kong\n\nChina called on the U.S. to protect Chinese nationals studying in the U.S. after a member of Congress requested several universities to disclose detailed information about their Chinese students, citing potential national security risks.\n\nIn a letter to six universities, Rep.

Department of Education. We're going to eliminate it,\" Trump said in the East Room of the White House at a ceremony where he was flanked by children seated at school desks. Before he signed the order, Trump turned to the children and asked, \"Should I do this?\"\n\nIntroducing McMahon, Trump said that \"hopefully she will be our last secretary of education.\" He vowed \"to find something else for you, Linda.\"\n\nCongressional approval would be needed to fully abolish the department. Trump said he hoped Democrats would vote in favor.\n\n\"I hope they're going to be voting for it,\" Trump said of congressional Democrats, \"because ultimately it may come before them.\"\n\nImmediately after the signing, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., the chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said on X that he will \"submit legislation\" to accomplish Trump's goal of shutting down the Education Department \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nCongress established the Education Department in 1979 during President Jimmy Carter's administration, and any effort to abolish it would face major obstacles from Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate, where 60 votes are required to overcome filibusters and advance measures to final votes.\n\nThe House Education Committee's top Democrat, Bobby Scott, of Virginia, called the executive order \"reckless\" and argued in a statement that it would put \"low-income students, students of color, students with disabilities, and rural students at risk.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday morning that the department would not be completely eliminated under the executive order, saying its \"critical functions\" would continue, including the enforcement of civil rights laws and oversight of student loans and Pell grants.\n\n\"The Department of Education will be much smaller than it is today,\" Leavitt said, adding that the order directed McMahon \"to greatly minimize the agency. So when it comes to student loans and Pell grants, those will still be run out of the Department of Education.\"\n\nThe executive order also will not affect department activities aimed at meeting the educational needs of students with disabilities or Title I funding, which goes to school districts with high proportions of students from low-income families, a senior administration official told NBC News on Wednesday.\n\nThe text of the order was not immediately published after the White House signing ceremony, which several Republican state attorneys general and governors attended. Trump publicly acknowledged Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and others.\n\nPolling on eliminating the Education Department shows the move is broadly unpopular, large part because of opposition from Democrats and independents. A Q u innipiac University su rvey conducted March 6-10 found that 60% of registered voters opposed the plan, while 33% were in favor of it. Just 1% of Democrats are in favor of the move, while 98% oppose it. The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.\n\nAt her Senate confirmation hearing last month, McMahon acknowledged the need to coordinate with Congress to close the department.\n\n\"Certainly President Trump understands that we'll be working with Congress,\" she said in response to a question from Cassidy. \"We'd like to do this right. We'd like to make sure that we are presenting a plan that I think our senators could get on board with and our Congress could get on board with that would have a better-functioning Department of Education but certainly does require congressional action.\"\n\nWith Trump's executive order, however, it appears the administration to some extent is sidestepping lawmakers. McMahon said Tuesday on SiriusXM's \"The David Webb Show\" that as they \"wind down\" her department, administration officials want to ensure they are providing states with best practices and the tools they will need.\n\nIn her justification for eliminating the department , McMahon said: \"I think it's important to note what the Department of Education does not do. The Department of Education doesn't educate anyone. It doesn't hire teachers. It doesn't establish curriculum. It doesn't hire school boards or superintendents. It really is to help provide funding so that the states themselves can help with their own programs. But that creativity and innovation has to come from the state level.\"\n\nMcMahon and the administration have already taken steps in recent weeks to gut the department by cutting its workforce nearly in half.\n\nNBC N e ws recently re ported that state officials and lawmakers have said they are not prepared to take on the full responsibility of education policy, and Trump's latest order is likely to be met with more legal challenges .\n\nLabor and civil rights groups issued statements Wednesday blasting the administration for the move. National Education Association President Becky Pringle said the administration's actions \"will hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle class families, taking away special education services for students with disabilities, and gutting student civil rights protections.\"\n\nNAACP President Derrick Johnson called the order \"unconstitutional,\" adding that \"the rule of law doesn't seem to matter\" to Trump.\n\n\"Only Congress can establish or abolish an executive agency,\" Johnson said. \"Trump is not just seeking to shut down an agency, he is deliberately dismantling the basic functions of our democracy, one piece at a time. This is a dark day for the millions of American children who depend on federal funding for a quality education, including those in poor and rural communities with parents who voted for Trump.\"\n\nRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.\n\nGarrett Haake is NBC News' senior White House correspondent.\n\nKatherine Doyle is a White House reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "What to know about how Trump's executive order will affect American education\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday in an effort to \"begin eliminating the federal Department of Education.\" With the stroke of his pen, he officially set in motion a plan to shutter the 46-year-old agency, as he said, \"once and for all.\"\n\nBut the order stops short of immediately closing the department, which cannot be done without congressional approval. Rather, according to the text of the order released by the White House, it directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\"\n\nAt the signing, Trump said federal Pell grants (a common type of federal undergraduate financial aid), Title I funding and resources and funding for children with disabilities would be \"preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments.\"\n\n\"But beyond these core necessities, my administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department,\" he said, adding that he would do so \"as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe move still promises to upend the key functions the department performs in the broader education system, which include oversight of the federal student loan portfolio, civil rights enforcement in schools and the distribution of billions of dollars to help impoverished and disabled students.\n\nSeveral big questions about the Education Department's future remain unanswered. But there is still a significant amount known about the agency's history and duties - as well as the many plans conservatives have circulated for decades to unwind the agency.\n\nIn 1979, Democratic President Jimmy Carter signed legislation that made the Education Department a Cabinet-level agency. Until that point, the government had a Department of Health, Education and Welfare, created during the Eisenhower administration.\n\nConservatives have been clamoring to abolish it for more than 40 years - essentially since it was created. Carter's successor, President Ronald Reagan, vowed to shut it down one year after it opened - and Republicans have basically repeated that call since.\n\nThe Education Department is one of the smallest Cabinet-level departments . Its $268 billion appropriation last year represented 4% of the U.S. budget . McMahon announced earlier this month a plan to cut roughly half of the agency's staff .\n\nAmong its most prominent duties, the agency manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio for college and postsecondary students. It also distributes billions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools through programs that serve more than 50 million students in nearly 100,000 public schools and 32,000 private schools.\n\nThat funding includes more than $15 billion for thousands of so-called Title I schools - schools that receive federal dollars to help low-income families. And it includes more than $15 billion in funding for programs - under the auspices of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which provides grants to states for the education of children with disabilities - that ensure disabled students have access to a free and appropriate public education.\n\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights enforces laws aiming to prevent discrimination in schools, and the agency's Institute of Education Sciences runs data collection, statistics and research monitoring student outcomes.\n\nThe vast balance of power on education, however, still lies with states and local districts, which fund the bulk of K-12 education and set all curriculums.\n\nThe U.S. Education Department has no say in curriculum matters. It does not set requirements for enrollment and graduation in schools, nor does it have a say in the selection or use of school or library books, textbooks or resources.\n\nSchools that receive federal money through Title I programs and IDEA must meet specific conditions and maintain specific reporting rules. Conservatives have long claimed that those requirements are arduous and have pushed for allowing states to have flexibility and freedom to spend the money as they wish.\n\nEven though Trump cannot fully end the Education Department himself, McMahon agreed at her confirmation hearing that the administration hopes to present a plan that Congress would support, and Republicans in the House have introduced various plans that seek to eliminate the department. Still, with narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate, it's unlikely to move forward.\n\nYet short of that, the administration has other ways to shrink the department's footprint.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said ahead of the executive order's signing that \"critical programs will be protected\" and that, specifically, student loans and federal Pell Grants would continue to be handled by the department. In addition, a senior administration official said Wednesday night that Title I, student loans and students with disabilities - who rely on IDEA funding - will not be affected.\n\nBut it remains unclear how existing services would not be interrupted as the agency is dismantled.\n\nEducation advocates have long warned that major cutbacks would dramatically affect the federal government's enormous student loan portfolio and Title I and IDEA funding. What these cuts would mean for groups who rely on that funding remains one of the biggest questions to emerge after news first broke that the Trump White House was looking to eliminate the agency.\n\nOne possibility is that the new framework for education policy could take its cues from the many plans that conservative education activists have circulated for decades on how they'd like to see the department disemboweled. Those plans largely center on transferring key functions of the department to other federal agencies, even though some education experts contend that even those transfers would require congressional approval.\n\nOne House bill introduced in January by Rep. David Rouzer, R-N.C., proposes transferring most of the department's responsibilities to other agencies. Student loan programs would go to the Treasury Department, for example, and job training programs to the Labor Department.\n\nThe bill also proposes that the federal government be allowed to provide nearly all other education funding it currently gives to states with almost no conditions or reporting requirements attached.\n\nOne plan from February touted by officials at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research pushed for transferring civil rights enforcement issues in public schools to the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nEducation advocates have warned that moving those responsibilities to the DOJ would likely result in fewer investigations and less enforcement, because it would mean saddling a smaller team with even more responsibilities. The Justice Department also has discretion in which cases it investigates, whereas the Education Department is required to investigate complaints alleging discrimination within the past 180 days. (The Trump administration's layoffs at the Education Department earlier this month greatly impacted the agency's Office for Civil Rights .)\n\nThat plan also advocated for spinning off the federal student loan portfolio into an independent financial entity.\n\nMeanwhile, Project 2025 - which pushed for abolishing the whole agency - also advocated for ending Title I funding in phases. It also proposes ending student debt cancellation programs .\n\nOther advocates for conservative education policy have said the federal government should convert most of the funding it gives to states for K-12 programs into block grants, a form of funding that comes with fewer rules and less federal oversight.\n\nBut public education advocates have warned that kind of shift could allow red states to pour dollars into private schools, which do not have to abide by federal education civil rights laws.\n\nUnder some other GOP proposals, Title I funding for the poorest schools would shift to allow poor students to take that money to private schools if they choose.\n\nIn February, a dozen top education officials from GOP-controlled states pitched McMahon on giving out federal school funding as block grants. Those Republicans said they wanted to be allowed to shift funding to support \"state-driven initiatives\" and \"alternative spending approaches,\" and asked McMahon to grant them waivers on certain federal requirements that come with their allocations. Red states typically rely more heavily on federal education funding than blue ones.\n\nPrivate schools that do not receive federal funding are exempt from civil rights laws, such as those barring discrimination based on a student's race, gender or disability. Private academies also do not have to provide individualized education plans to children with learning disabilities. It's unclear whether any of the federal civil rights protections overseen by the Education Department would apply if states used federal dollars to support private K-12 schools under their proposed block grant schemes.\n\nAdam Edelman is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

McConnell's restraining order barring the government from continuing to implement its sweeping freeze of funding and another ruling that found that government had violated the order . Lawyers for the Justice Department contended in part that McConnell's order was vague, but the appeals court suggested they should be patient.\n\n\"We are confident the District Court will act with dispatch to provide any clarification needed with respect to, among other things, the defendants' contention that the February 10 Order 'bars both the President and much of the Federal Government from exercising their own lawful authorities to withhold funding without the prior approval of the district court,'\" the appeals court wrote Tuesday.\n\nIt said both sides should submit further arguments on the government's request for a stay pending a full appeal by Thursday. The administration has asked the appeals court to rule on the full stay request by Friday.\n\n\"These unlawful injunctions are a continuation of the weaponization of justice against President Trump. The White House will continue to fight these battles in court, and we expect to be vindicated,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe legal challenge was brought by a coalition of 22 states in the wake of the chaos and confusion across the country last month caused by a wide-ranging Office of Management and Budget memo aimed at implementing some of President Donald Trump's executive orders.\n\nThe memo directed federal agencies to \"temporarily pause all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders\" on issues like foreign aid and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. It was later rescinded, but Leavitt said the same day that the underlying funding freeze was still in effect.\n\nJudge McConnell granted the states' request for a temporary restraining order on Jan. 31 in a ruling finding the states \"are likely to succeed on the merits of some, if not all, their claims\" that the funding freeze exceeded the president's powers.\n\n\"Federal law specifies how the Executive should act if it believes that appropriations are inconsistent with the President's priorities - it must ask Congress, not act unilaterally,\" he wrote.\n\nThe states later contended that some of the funding was still frozen, leading McConnell to issue an order Monday directing the government to comply with his order . He also pushed back against the government's assertion that his order was vague.\n\nMcConnell wrote that the order lifting the freeze had been \"clear and unambiguous\" and that the states had \"presented evidence in this motion that the Defendants in some cases have continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds.\"\n\nThe \"pauses in funding violate the plain text\" of the order, he wrote, directing that the funding be immediately restored.\n\nIt was the first time since Trump's second inauguration that a federal judge has accused his administration of defying a court order, and it comes as his administration has hit numerous roadblocks enacting parts of his agenda because of legal challenges.\n\nVice President JD Vance wrote on social media over the weekend, \"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.\"\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, whom Trump named as head of his advisory Department of Government Efficiency, also complained about the judges who have been blocking his access to some federal agencies. He suggested that some of those orders might need to be defied , a position that some frustrated staffers in the White House agree with.\n\nTrump, who has a history of publicly blasting judges who have ruled against him, said Tuesday he would listen to the courts. \"I always abide by the courts, and then I'll have to appeal it,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nMcConnell is expected to a hold a hearing on the states' request for an injunction this month.\n\nDaniel Barnes reports for NBC News, based in Washington.\n\nChloe Atkins reports for the NBC News National Security and Law Unit, based in New York.\n\nDareh Gregorian is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Trump's order states that designating English as the country's official language will further \"empower\" new citizens and aid them in assimilating.\n\n\"Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society,\" the order states.\n\nWhile English is the most widely used language in the country, U.S. residents communicate in more than 350 languages , according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. More than three-quarters of Americans speak only English at home, according to the b ureau .\n\nThe change is consistent with Trump's hard-line immigration stance, including his executive order ending birthright citizenship - which several courts have struck down.\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, he railed against undocumented immigrants that didn't speak English and warned about the languages that were \"coming into our country.\"\n\nAt the presidential debate against then-Vice President Kamala Harris in September, he said, \"They can't even speak English. They don't even know what country they're in, practically\" and last April, he said that the town of Whitewater, Wisconsin, was full of undocumented immigrants who \"don't speak a word of English.\"\n\nIn remarks at the March 2024 Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump said, \"We have languages coming into our country. We don't have one instructor in our entire nation that can speak that language ... These are languages - it's the craziest thing - they have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. It's a very horrible thing.\"\n\nTrump's own vice president has previously pushed for English to be the country's official language. In the last Congress, then-Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, introduced the English Language Unity Act with Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., which would have required the federal government to use English \"in commonsense circumstances.\"\n\n\"This commonsense legislation recognizes an inherent truth: English is the language of this country. That is why the overwhelming majority of the American people support this proposal,\" Vance said in a statement when they unveiled the measure. \"The English language has been a cornerstone of American culture for over 250 years. It is far past time for Congress to codify its place into law, which is exactly what this bill does.\"\n\nGabe Gutierrez is a senior White House correspondent for NBC News.\n\nRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

It also removed or archived hundreds of guidance documents, reports, and training materials that include mentions of DEI from its outward facing communication channels.\n\nDaniel Barnes reports for NBC News, based in Washington.\n\nNnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"\n\nBoasberg on Saturday issued a temporary order barring the administration from deporting people by i nvoking the AEA and ordered any such flights that were in the air to return to the U.S.\n\nThere were two flights that did not return - the government claimed they were already out of U.S. airspace, so the deportees were already technically \"removed\" from the country.\n\nAt a hearing on Monday, the judge called the government's arguments a \"stretch\" and summarized them as \"we don't care, we'll do what we want.\" He ordered the Justice Department to turn over more information about the flights the next day, leading to the days of pushback by the administration, which claimed he was not entitled to ask questions relating to the AEA, a wartime statute that dates back to 1798.\n\nThe act had previously only been invoked during major wars - the War of 1812 and both world wars.\n\nA Trump proclamation last week applied it to members of Tren De Aragua , a Venezuelan gang that his administration has declared to be a foreign terrorist organization. The proclamation said the gang \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\"\n\nThat led to the suit brought on behalf of five Venezuelan nationals the government is trying to deport under the act, and who maintain they're not members of the gang.\n\nBoasberg has not yet made any finding on the plaintiffs' claim that the AEA cannot apply to a gang from a country the U.S. is not at war with, but Trump has continued accusing him of trying to \"usurp\" his power. \"No District Court Judge, or any Judge, can assume the duties of the President of the United States. Only Crime and Chaos would result,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday morning.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland on Thursday signed a temporary restraining order blocking DOGE's access to sensitive records for millions of Americans housed at the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe \"millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent\" contain \"sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page opinion .\n\nThat information \"includes Social Security numbers, personal medical and mental health records, driver's license information, bank account data, tax information, earnings history, birth and marriage records, home and work addresses, school records, immigration and/or naturalization records, health care providers' contact information, family court records, and employment and employer records,\" she noted, adding the office hadn't put forward a rationale for needing such access.\n\n\"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion. It has launched a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack,\" Hollander wrote, describing the administration's methods as \"tantamount to hitting a fly with a sledgehammer.\"\n\nHer order barred DOGE from accessing any more sensitive records and directed it to \"disgorge and delete\" any such data it has, as well as barring it from \"installing any software\" on SSA information systems.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge in Maryland found Musk and DOGE's work to largely dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development \"likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang said \"the power to act to eliminate federal agencies resides exclusively with Congress\" and that DOGE's work to dismantle USAID violates the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution.\n\nThe government argued that Musk is merely an adviser to the president and was not responsible for efforts to slash the workforce and shutter USAID headquarters.\n\nThe judge, however, pointed to numerous posts of Musk's on his X platform where he boasted he was responsible, including a Feb. 3 tweet where he wrote, \"We spent the weekend feeding USAID to the wood chipper. Could have gone to some great parties. Did that instead.\"\n\nChuang issued a preliminary injunction ordering the agency to take steps to reopen the agency's headquarters and to restore access to email, payment, security notification and other electronic systems for all USAID employees and contractors.\n\nChuang also barred DOGE from sharing the personal information of USAID staffers outside of the agency, citing the Musk team's \"extremely troubling lack of respect for security clearance requirements and agency rules relating to access to sensitive data.\"\n\nDOGE filed an appeal of Chuang's order early Friday.\n\nNot every plaintiff that sued DOGE this week was successful in court.\n\nThe U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonprofit funded by Congress and dedicated to conflict resolution, went to D.C. federal court seeking an emergency restraining order alleging that DOGE had used a \"takeover by force\" of its headquarters and was attempting to shut it down.\n\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell questioned DOGE's methods at a Wednesday hearing. \"I am very offended by how DOGE has operated at the institute and treated American citizens trying to do a job that they were statutorily tasked to do,\" Howell said, but she declined to sign the restraining order, saying the plaintiffs had not met the necessary requirements.\n\nThe Justice Department had contended the administration \"acted in accordance with all laws\" and had properly removed the institute's top officials.\n\nThough Howell ruled in the government's favor, the Justice Department moved Friday to remove her from another case involving the president.\n\nHowell signed off on a restraining order barring portions of  Trump's executive order punishing Perkins Coie, a law firm that's done high-profile work for Democrats. The order suspended employees' security clearances and barred them from federal buildings.\n\n\"It sends chills down my spine when you say that if the president in his view has the position that an individual, or an entity, or a company is operating a way that is not in the nation's interest, he can issue an executive order like this,\" Howell said at a hearing last week, calling it \"a pretty extraordinary power for the president to exercise.\"\n\nThe DOJ filing said the judge \"has repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President\" over the years, and cited her having signed off on parts of special counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump as one of the reasons she should recuse herself.\n\nAnother federal judge in D.C. issued a preliminary injunction barring the Defense Department from implementing Trump's executive order banning transgender people from enlisting or serving in the military .\n\nU.S. District Judge Ana Reyes found the ban is \"soaked in animus\" and violates the equal protection clause because it discriminates based on transgender status and sex.\n\n\"Its language is unabashedly demeaning, its policy stigmatizes transgender persons as inherently unfit, and its conclusions bear no relation to fact,\" she wrote , adding that the government failed to produce evidence about how many transgender service members there are, or how transgender status impacts their military readiness.\n\n\"Transgender persons have served openly since 2021, but Defendants have not analyzed their service. That is unfortunate. Plaintiffs' service records alone are Exhibit A for the proposition that transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health, selflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence,\" Reyes wrote.\n\nAt a hearing Friday, the government argued, as it had previously, that the order is focused on people with the medical condition \"gender dysphoria.\"\n\nReyes pointed to a Feb. 27 tweet by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declaring that \"Transgender troops are disqualified from service without an exemption.\"\n\n\"I am not going to abide by government officials saying one thing to the public - saying what they really mean to the public - and coming in here to the court and telling me something different, like I'm an idiot,\" Reyes told the DOJ attorney assigned to this case. \"I am not an idiot.\"\n\nThe Justice Department later called Reyes' injunction \"the latest example of an activist judge attempting to seize power at the expense of the American people who overwhelmingly voted to elect President Trump.\"\n\nYet another D.C. federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Environmental Protection Agency's decision to terminate up to $20 billion in grants for climate initiatives, in a case brought by the environmental group Climate United Fund.\n\nThe money for the \"Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund\" had been appropriated by Congress in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law by then-President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump's EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, vowed to recover those funds after he was sworn in in January, saying \"the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal,\" according to a court filing.\n\nThe agency froze the account and later terminated the grants to the three nonprofits, which alleged the EPA didn't follow proper procedures for terminating such grants.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan agreed.\n\n\"When the court asked EPA to proffer evidence justifying its decision given the terms of the agreement, its only response was to refer to the termination letter, which gave no legal justification for the termination,\" Chutkan wrote.\n\nShe said that while the EPA voiced concerns regarding \"program integrity\" and \"programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse,\" \"vague and unsubstantiated assertions of fraud are insufficient.\"\n\nDareh Gregorian is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\nGary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nChloe Atkins reports for the NBC News National Security and Law Unit, based in New York.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

In today's newsletter, we're diving into the Trump administration's various legal cases, including several where judges are starting to get annoyed. We're also taking a look at how the White House is handling potential conflicts of interest for Elon Musk, given his business interests, and how Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is handling a swell of Democratic anger at him. And last but not least, we answer another reader question using data from the latest NBC News poll. Enjoy the newsletter, and enjoy your weekend.\n\n- Scott Bland\n\nSeveral federal judges expressed frustration this week with how President Donald Trump's administration is pushing forward his sweeping agenda, as Trump and his allies got even more aggressive in their criticism of the judiciary, Dareh Gregorian, Gary Grumbach and Chloe Atkins report .\n\nTrump called for the impeachment of a judge who temporarily halted deportations being carried out under the rarely used Alien Enemies Act , while also blasting the jurist on his Truth Social platform as a \"grandstander\" whose rulings are \"inept.\"\n\nThe Trump administration currently has over 15 appeals pending, including from rulings this week reining in the power of Elon Musk's Department of Governmental Efficiency.\n\nYou can read more about those appeals and other cases here . But first - more on Musk, and how the White House is handling potential conflicts of interest for the world's richest man-turned-\"special government employee.\"\n\nAs the public face of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has an expansive portfolio that spans across the many levers of government - and that could intersect with his wide range of business interests, Ben Kamisar reports .\n\nBut unlike another high-profile \"special government employee\" working in Trump's White House, AI and crypto czar David Sacks , there's no evidence that Musk has obtained a conflict-of-interest waiver. Such a waiver would outline the steps he's taken to avoid overlaps between his business interests and his government work, include an explanation from the White House counsel about why it feels comfortable with Musk's arrangement, and identify areas where Musk has the green light to weigh in despite his business holdings.\n\nInstead, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Musk has already pledged he'd avoid potential conflicts of interest, and like all Trump-appointed \"special government employees,\" he's \"abiding by all applicable laws.\"\n\nIn response to an NBC News inquiry about a potential waiver for Musk, the White House counsel's office replied that \"the White House has no disclosures responsive to your request.\" And while some ethics documents are not immediately available for release, instead becoming public weeks after submission, the White House press office did not directly address whether Musk has sought or received a conflict-of-interest waiver that has not yet been released publicly.\n\nAnother special government employee, Sacks, did receive a conflict-of-interest waiver, which has been posted publicly on the White House's public disclosure portal (releasing these documents publicly upon request is mandated by federal law ). That 11-page memo , written by White House Counsel David Warrington, provides a road map to the kinds of conflict-of-interest rules that govern special government employees. The memo shows how Sacks has sought to divest his assets to satisfy the White House's lawyers, and it demonstrates why he is receiving a conflict-of-interest waiver in the first place that allows him to participate in \"certain particular matters regarding regulation and policy related to the digital asset industry.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is facing ongoing calls to step down from left-leaning activist groups and even some members of Congress upset with his decision to advance a Republican spending bill and avert a government shutdown. But Schumer remains defiant and has continued to insist he is the best leader for the party in the Senate at this moment.\n\nI pressed Schumer on his future in leadership when I spoke with him this week in an interview airing on \"Meet the Press\" this Sunday.\n\nStill, it doesn't seem like Schumer is facing the same level of opposition that confronted President Joe Biden when he stepped down as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee last summer. In that moment, scores of elected Democrats from both chambers of Congress came forward to call on Biden to end his campaign. (Schumer himself reportedly pushed Biden to drop out of the race , according to The New York Times.)\n\nIn this moment, most of the pushback so far is coming from Democrats in the House. And some Senate Democrats who were outspoken about Biden are holding their fire on Schumer.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., one of the first Democratic members of Congress who called on Biden to step aside last year, sidestepped a question at a recent town hall about whether Schumer should remain in his leadership post, notably stopping short of calling on Schumer to pass the torch. Bennet said, \"In dodging your question, let me just say it's important for people to know, you know, when it's time to go. And I think in the case of Joe Biden, and we're going to have future conversations about all the Democratic leadership.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who has emerged as a leading voice urging Democrats to more aggressively take on Trump, also told me on \"Meet the Press\" last week that he still supports the minority leader .\n\n\"Leader Schumer has a very difficult job. I don't envy the job that he has,\" Murphy said. \"And the question is really for the members of his Democratic caucus: Are we willing to fight?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic angst has continued to simmer, boiling over at recent town hall meetings. And Democratic voters want their party to put up a fight, according to the latest NBC News poll .\n\nSo is Schumer making the same mistake as Biden and overstaying his welcome as a leader of the Democratic Party? I asked him that question directly, so tune in on Sunday to hear his response. Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, will also be joining \"Meet the Press\" this week.\n\nThanks to everyone who emailed us this week! One reader asked how voters in red states are viewing President Donald Trump's flurry of executive orders and Elon Musk's efforts to slash the federal government via the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTo answer that, we turned to one of our resident polling experts, Ben Kamisar. Here's his response:\n\nIt's a great question - obviously not everyone in a red state voted for Trump or is on board with everything he's doing. But voters in these states do give Trump more leeway given his increased level of popularity there.\n\nOne way to answer this question is to dig into our polling data and split out respondents from states that voted for Trump. Then, we can compare their ratings of the president to the overall numbers.\n\nTrump's approval rating in states that voted for him in 2024 is 57%, compared to 47% among registered voters nationally. Trump-state voters are also more likely to approve of his handling of key issues. But they're effectively split on whether they approve or disapprove of his handling of the economy and the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nAs for DOGE, Trump-state voters are more likely to have a positive view of Musk and the department than registered voters at large (49% of these voters viewed Musk positively, compared to 39% of registered voters nationwide, while 49% of Trump-state voters viewed DOGE positively compared to 41% of registered voters nationwide). And a majority of Trump-state voters, 53%, say DOGE is a good idea.\n\nThat's all From the Politics Desk for now. Today's newsletter was compiled by Scott Bland and Faith Wardwell.\n\nIf you have feedback - likes or dislikes - email us at politicsnewsletter@nbcuni.com\n\nAnd if you're a fan, please share with everyone and anyone.

Such a waiver would outline the steps he's taken to avoid overlaps between his business interests and his government work, include an explanation from the White House counsel about why they feel comfortable with Musk's arrangement, and it would identify areas where Musk has the green light to weigh in despite his business holdings.\n\nInstead, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Musk has already pledged he'd avoid potential conflicts of interest and like all Trump-appointed \"special government employees,\" he's \"abiding by all applicable laws.\"\n\n\"For concerns regarding conflicts of interest between Elon Musk and DOGE, President Trump has stated he will not allow conflicts, and Elon himself has committed to recusing himself from potential conflicts. DOGE has been incredibly transparent about what they're doing, posting daily updates on X and updating their website,\" Leavitt said in a statement to NBC News.\n\n\"It's standard practice for Administrations to hire individuals as Special Government Employees to focus on specific issues, based on their outside experience, for a limited period of time,\" Leavitt continued, adding, \"All SGEs are filling out the appropriate paperwork, receiving briefings on ethics rules, including the conflict of interest rules, and abiding by all applicable federal laws.\"\n\nThe White House first publicly acknowledged Musk's position on Feb. 3 , announcing he'd serve as a \"special government employee,\" a designation used by presidents over the years to allow outside experts to lend their knowledge to the government without having to ditch their private-sector jobs. The administration has sworn under oath that Musk is a \"senior adviser to the president,\" not a DOGE employee, though Trump has repeatedly emphasized that Musk is running the show there.\n\nIt's no secret that Musk's broad business portfolio, which includes the space company SpaceX and the electric vehicle company Tesla, intersects with a slew of government regulators and potential government contracts. That's why Democrats and others have raised concerns about how the government and Musk will ensure those conflicts don't creep into official administration decisions.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk told Fox Business that DOGE is \"pretty much\" in every federal department . In one example of the convergence of Musk's business interests and the federal government, Starlink, his satellite internet service, is being considered for use in more and more places across the federal government. Musk businesses like Tesla and SpaceX have received billions in government subsidies and contracts, and his interests have been involved in key regulatory battles with the federal government over the years.\n\nMusk's Tesla also relies heavily on China both for production and as a market - a relationship that came up Friday after Musk received a briefing at the Pentagon that included a discussion on China. During a conversation with reporters in the Oval Office hours later, Trump denied a report that the briefing would include military plans related to a hypothetical war with China , calling Musk a \"great patriot\" and saying that Musk's business dealings with China would be a reason not to show him something like that.\n\n\"I don't want to show that to anybody, but certainly you wouldn't show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. He's a great patriot. He's paying a big price for helping us cut costs, and he's doing a great job. He's finding tremendous waste, fraud and abuse,\" Trump said.\n\n\"But I certainly wouldn't want - you know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that, but it was such a fake story,\" Trump continued.\n\nAs a \"special government employee,\" Musk is subject to a series of legal restrictions and guardrails aimed at protecting the American people from concerns about conflicts of interest or an outside adviser making financial gains from their advice to the president.\n\nFederal law bars all employees of the executive branch from \"substantially\" participating in a \"particular matter\" where they, their immediate family or business partners have a \"financial interest,\" though that matter must have a \"direct and predictable effect on that interest\" to be forbidden.\n\nIf Musk sat on certain kinds of government committees, he could receive a waiver if it was deemed that the need for his services outweighed conflict concerns. But Musk is not publicly linked to a committee that would qualify.\n\nWith no indication he qualifies for that kind of waiver, Musk could also receive a conflict of interest waiver under a stricter standard: that \"the financial interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the employee's services.\" But it's not clear whether Musk sought, or received, any conflict of interest waivers.\n\nIn response to an NBC News inquiry about a potential waiver for Musk, the White House Counsel's office replied that \"the White House has no disclosures responsive to your request.\" And while some ethics documents are not immediately available for release, instead becoming public weeks after submission, the White House press office did not directly address whether Musk has sought or received a conflict of interest waiver that has not yet been released publicly.\n\nAnother special government employee, Sacks, did receive a conflict of interest waiver, which has been posted publicly on the White House's public disclosure portal (releasing these documents publicly upon request is mandated by federal law ). That 11-page memo , written by White House Counsel David Warrington, provides a roadmap to the kinds of conflict of interest rules that govern special government employees. The memo shows how Sacks has sought to divest his assets to satisfy the White House's lawyers, and it demonstrates why he is receiving a conflict of interest waiver in the first place that allows him to participate in \"certain particular matters regarding regulation and policy related to the digital asset industry.\"\n\n\"By its very nature, the position of Special Advisor for AI and Crypto requires an appointee with extensive and hands-on experience in financial technology and innovation, with intimate knowledge of the digital asset industry. It would be exceedingly difficult to find such expertise if financial technology executives, software company founders, and venture capital investors in the digital asset industry for excluded from the position,\" Warrington wrote in the memo granting Sacks a \"limited\" conflict of interest waiver.\n\n\"A core impetus for the nation's modern conflict of interest laws ... was a recognition that in matters of technology, science, and innovation, the Government required leaders from the private sector to lend their knowledge and experience to the shaping of national public policy,\" Warrington added.\n\nNeither Sacks nor Musk has to file a public financial disclosure. (The disclosures they have to file are allowed to remain private unless they begin drawing a substantial government salary.)\n\nA White House official told NBC News that the White House Counsel's Office vets all \"special government employees\" and advises them of the limits of where they can and can't participate. And the official added that the outside business interests of \"special government employees\" is a feature, not a bug, as the whole point of the status is to allow successful people to lend their expertise to the federal government.\n\nBut the lack of a public waiver, combined with Musk's sprawling business interests and impact across the federal government, raises concerns from some ethics officials, including those who have been critical of Trump and his administration over conflict of interests in the past.\n\n\"A conflict of interest waiver for Musk could not be justified,\" Walter Shaub, the former director of the United States Office of Government Ethics who resigned a few months into Trump's first term, wrote in an email. \"Elon Musk is the world's richest individual who is a government contractor. The American people have every reason to want their tax dollars and the resources of their national government to serve only their interests, not the interests of billionaire government contractor who now seems to have stuck his fingers in everything the government does.\"\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

She called the job terminations the first step toward shutting down the department.\n\n\"That was the president's mandate,\" McMahon said last week in an interview with Fox News. \"His directive to me, clearly, is to shut down the Department of Education, which we know we'll have to work with Congress, you know, to get that accomplished.\"\n\nMcMahon similarly vowed at her Senate confirmation hearing to work with Congress to advance Trump's plan to dismantle the department. She telegraphed in an email to employees this month that major changes were coming.\n\n\"Our job is to respect the will of the American people and the President they elected, who has tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of bureaucratic bloat here at the Department of Education-a momentous final mission-quickly and responsibly,\" she wrote, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.\n\nThe Senate confirmed McMahon in a 51-45 vote. No Democrat voted for her.\n\nTrump has suggested that he could garner enough congressional support to formally close the department, characterizing teachers unions as more of a threat to the plan than lawmakers.\n\n\"I think I'd work with Congress,\" Trump said last month in the Oval Office. \"We'd have to work with the teachers union, because the teachers union is the only one that's opposed to it.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump has secured the support of any Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have balked at his efforts on that front.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, accused Trump and Elon Musk, the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency, of \"robbing our students and families of critical funding.\"\n\n\"The effects of Trump and Musk's slash and burn campaign will be felt across our state-by students and families who suffer from the loss of Department staff working to ensure their rights under federal law, school districts who have to lay off teachers, students who can't get the help they need to get financial aid, and families who get ripped off because the watchdogs were fired,\" Murray said in a statement Wednesday night. \"This issue is personal for me, and for every single family. We cannot relent in this fight.\"\n\nA coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit last week arguing any attempt by Trump to eliminate the department is unlawful.\n\n\"Because neither the President nor his agencies can undo the many acts of Congress that authorize the Department, dictate its responsibilities, and appropriate funds for it to administer, the President's directive to eliminate the Department of Education-including through the March 11 decimation of the Department's workforce and any other agency implementation-is an unlawful violation of the separation of powers, and the Executive's obligation to take care that the law be faithfully executed,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nThe Education Department is one of the smallest Cabinet-level departments . Its $268 billion appropriations last year represented 4% of the U.S. budget .\n\nThe department does not dictate curricula used in classrooms. It is largely a funding and civil rights enforcement organization, distributing money for schools with high rates of impoverished students and to assist children with disabilities.\n\nIt also runs the public student loan program, which has more consumer protections and lower interest rates than private education loan programs.\n\nTrump's executive order will direct McMahon to ensure the agency's funds do not go toward programs or activities that advance diversity, equity and inclusion goals or gender ideology.\n\nThe Education Department last week announced investigations into more than 50 universities it accused of \"engaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programs.\"\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, is a widely used label applied to efforts to improve workplace culture and create more opportunities for disadvantaged groups, and they are not inherently discriminatory.\n\nNational Education Association President Becky Pringle said in a statement Wednesday that Trump's effort to close the Education Department could have disastrous implications for students across the country.\n\n\"If successful, Trump's continued actions will hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle class families, taking away special education services for students with disabilities, and gutting student civil rights protections,\" Pringle said in a statement.\n\nShe accused Trump and Musk of aiming \"their wrecking ball at public schools and the futures of the 50 million students in rural, suburban, and urban communities across America to pay for tax handouts for billionaires.\"\n\nMcMahon said last week that at least three DOGE staffers had been auditing the Education Department.\n\nKeri Rodrigues, the president of the National Parents Union, said dismantling the department would disproportionately affect the most vulnerable communities.\n\n\"Let's be clear: Before federal oversight, millions of children-particularly those with disabilities and those from our most vulnerable communities-were denied the opportunities they deserved,\" Rodrigues said in a statement Wednesday night. \"The Department of Education was created to ensure that every child, regardless of background or zip code, has access to a public education that prepares them for their future. Eliminating it would roll back decades of progress, leaving countless children behind in an education system that has historically failed the most marginalized.\"\n\nTrump has long pledged to dismantle the Education Department, first mentioning the idea during his previous term and campaigning on the promise extensively throughout the 2024 election. He has suggested that states should take over administering educational policy and that other parts of the federal government could absorb current agency responsibilities, like overseeing federal student loans.\n\n\"Your state is going to control your children's education. We're moving it out of Washington immediately,\" Trump said at a campaign event last year in Saginaw, Michigan. \"We're going to do that very fast, and it's going to be great.\"\n\nGarrett Haake is NBC News' senior White House correspondent.\n\nNnamdi Egwuonwu is a politics reporter at NBC News.\n\nTyler Kingkade is a national reporter for NBC News, based in Los Angeles.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Poll: Trump faces early challenges on the economy as a united GOP backs big change\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nVoters are starting 2025 sour on the state of the economy and President Donald Trump 's handling of it so far, even as his election to a second term sparked an upswing in positive feelings about the direction of the nation, according to a new national NBC News poll .\n\nBuoyed by jubilant and unified Republicans, who are standing in lockstep with Trump and the expansive agenda he and congressional leaders are pushing in Washington, more registered voters see the U.S. as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004, though a majority still say the country is on the wrong track. Trump's approval rating also equals his best-ever mark as president (47%), though again, a majority (51%) disapproves of his performance.\n\nMeanwhile, driven in part by a pessimistic shift among Democrats since Trump's election, just 18% of voters rate the economy as \"excellent\" or \"good\" - not as low as the poorest economic marks during the Biden administration, according to CNBC polling from 2022, but within a handful of points and as low as that mark has been in NBC News polling since 2014. Majorities of voters disapprove of Trump's early job performance on the economy (54% disapprove, 44% approve) and how he's handling inflation and the cost of living (55% disapprove, 42% approve).\n\nIt's a new development for Trump, who never previously had a majority against his handling of the economy in a national NBC News poll. Now, he is confronting jittery markets and businesses amid his early moves to put tariffs on U.S. neighbors and other allies. Trump also faces questions from voters about whether he is sufficiently focused on their core issue of costs as he pursues other projects like reshaping the federal bureaucracy.\n\nOverall, the poll reflects an America that remains deeply divided in the months following Trump's 2024 victory, as it was in the months before.\n\nVoters narrowly disapprove of Trump's overall job performance, but the margin is closer than at almost any point during his first term. His personal ratings and the share of Republicans identifying as part of the MAGA movement have grown, reflecting the unity inside his party giving him wide latitude in a GOP-controlled Washington.\n\nIn another change from Trump's first term in the White House, the public has come around on his deportation-focused immigration policies, though voters are wary of his handling of other issues, including foreign policy.\n\nVoters like the general idea of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump-blessed effort to slash government jobs and spending. But they harbor reservations about its rapid-fire execution so far, as well as about billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, DOGE's de facto head.\n\nAnd voters are split evenly on which party they'd like to see win the 2026 midterm elections, even as the Democratic Party faces record-low popularity and fractious divides over how to respond to Trump. (The survey was conducted March 7-11, before Senate Democrats provided a handful of votes to help resolve a government funding fight.)\n\n\"While this survey shows a mixed result for Donald Trump, Democrats are the ones in the wilderness right now,\" said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. Horwitt called Trump's upside-down numbers among independents \"a flashing red light across the survey.\"\n\nMcInturff noted how Trump has fortified his base over the last year. The political story of the next year, he said, will be whether voter dissatisfaction on the economy or other issues takes hold - \"or the strength of the Republican and Trump base has maintained a very competitive election\" in 2026, McInturff continued.\n\nTrump's job approval rating (47%) and personal favorable rating (46%), along with the 44% who believe the country is on the right track, are at all-time highs in NBC News polling during his political career.\n\nBut they are also far below where previous presidents stood during the \"honeymoon period\" of new administrations, marking the polarization that has defined the Trump years. Slightly more disapprove of Trump's job performance (51%) and view him personally negatively (49%), and 54% see the country as on the wrong track.\n\nUnderscoring the deep partisan divide, Trump has the largest gap of any president in the last 80 years between his approval rating among members of his own party (90%) and his approval rating from the opposing party (4%), according to an analysis of three decades of NBC News polling and earlier data from Gallup.\n\nAmong independents, 30% approve and 67% disapprove of Trump's performance in office. A large gender gap still persists, with men approving of Trump's job performance 55%-43%, while women split the other way, 40%-58%.\n\nVice President JD Vance is viewed positively by 41% of voters and negatively by 47%. That compares unfavorably to the even or positive appraisals of vice presidents at the beginning of the previous three administrations, according to NBC News polls.\n\nWhen it comes to the issues, Trump fares particularly well on immigration. Fifty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove. A similar share, 56%, say he's bringing the \"right kind of change\" on the issue, while 25% say he's bringing the wrong change and 18% say he isn't bringing change.\n\nBut that's the only one of the five issues tested in the poll - border security and immigration, foreign policy, the economy, inflation and cost of living, and the war between Russia and Ukraine - that sees a majority of American voters approve of how Trump is handling it.\n\nForty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of foreign policy and 53% disapprove of it, while 42% approve of his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with 55% disapproving.\n\nThe split between how voters see his delivery on immigration and on economic issues comes after Trump identified them as the twin pillars of his 2024 victory, telling NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" in December : \"I won on the border and I won on groceries.\"\n\nJust 1% rate the economy as \"excellent\" and 17% as \"good,\" with 39% calling it \"only fair\" and 43% rating it \"poor.\" While Republicans are more likely to have favorable views of the economy than others, majorities across virtually every demographic still view the economy in an unfavorable light.\n\nAbout one-third (32%) of voters say their family's income is staying about even with the cost of living, but 60% say it's falling behind. Another 7% say their family's income is rising faster than the cost of living.\n\nAsked to gauge their satisfaction about how much Trump is doing to battle inflation, a majority say they aren't satisfied - 46% say they are \"not at all satisfied\" and another 9% say they are \"not too satisfied,\" while 20% are \"somewhat\" satisfied and 23% are \"very\" satisfied.\n\nThe NBC News poll also gauged voters' feelings on what kind of change Trump is bringing as president, with 40% saying he's bringing the right kind of change to inflation and the cost of living, while 30% say he's bringing the wrong change and 28% say he isn't bringing change.\n\nOn trade and tariffs, 41% say he's bringing the right change, 38% say the wrong change and 18% say he is not bringing change.\n\nOverall, 46% said Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 30% said he's bringing the wrong kind of change, and 21% said he's not bringing change.\n\nVoters are open, narrowly, to an effort to tackle inefficiencies in government. But concerns about Musk and about how DOGE is executing those cuts could be a public opinion liability for the administration.\n\nForty-six percent of voters say establishing a Department of Government Efficiency was a good idea, while 40% say it was a bad idea and another 13% do not have an opinion. However, DOGE itself is viewed unfavorably, with 41% holding positive views of the effort and 47% holding negative views.\n\nAnd Musk is unpopular, with 51% holding negative views of the tech mogul and 39% viewing him positively. Half of voters (49%) say they have positive views about federal workers, while 21% view them negatively and 29% feel neutral about them.\n\nAsked to reflect broadly on DOGE, one-third of voters said Musk and DOGE's efforts to reduce spending and the size of the federal government \"should continue as much more needs to be done.\" Meanwhile, 28% say \"it is needed but should slow down to assess the impact.\" And another 33% say \"it is reckless and should stop now before more damage is done.\"\n\nWhile Trump's standing is largely based on overwhelming support from within his own party, the Democratic Party now sits at its lowest favorable rating in the history of NBC News polling . Just 27% of registered voters view the party positively. That includes just 59% of self-identified Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, 65% of Democrats say they want Democratic lawmakers to stick to their positions even if this means not being able to get things done in Washington, while 32% want them to compromise with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.\n\nStill, voters remain split as to who they want to control Congress after next year's midterm elections: 48% back Democrats, while 47% back Republicans.\n\nAs Trump dominates Washington, 53% of registered voters say Republicans in Congress are too supportive of the president, 6% say they are too critical and 39% say they are dealing with Trump in the right way. By comparison, 50% say congressional Democrats are too critical of Trump, 16% say they are too supportive of him and 30% say they are dealing with him in the right way.\n\nA plurality, 44%, believe the Supreme Court is dealing with Trump in the right way, while 35% believe it's been too supportive and 14% believe it's been too critical.\n\nA near-majority, 49%, say that CEOs of large corporations are too supportive of Trump, 29% believe they are dealing with him correctly and 12% believe they are being too critical.\n\nAnd when it comes to the news media, 46% of voters say it has been too critical of Trump, 25% say it's been too supportive, and 24% say it's been dealing with Trump the right way.\n\nThe NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nScott Bland is a senior politics editor at NBC News.\n\nBen Kamisar is a national political reporter for NBC News\n\nBridget Bowman is a national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Trump signs order aiming to close the Education Department\n\nCory Turner\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive action to begin dismantling the U.S. Department of Education. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident Trump signed a long-expected executive action on Thursday calling on U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities.\" The president signed the order at an event at the White House, alongside a dozen students sitting in desks and the Republican governors of Texas, Indiana, Florida and Ohio.\n\n\"We're going to be returning education, very simply, back to the states where it belongs,\" Trump said. \"And this is a very popular thing to do, but much more importantly, it's a common sense thing to do, and it's going to work, absolutely.\"\n\nThe move has been expected since early February, when the White House revealed its intentions but withheld the action until after McMahon's Senate confirmation. It now arrives more than a week after the Trump administration has already begun sweeping layoffs at the Education Department.\n\nAccording to the administration's own numbers , Trump inherited a department with 4,133 employees. Nearly 600 workers have since chosen to leave, by resigning or retiring. And last week, 1,300 workers were told they would lose their jobs as part of a reduction in force. That leaves 2,183 staff at the department - roughly half the size it was just a few weeks ago.\n\nThe order instructs McMahon to act \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law,\" an acknowledgement that the department and its signature responsibilities were created by Congress and cannot legally be ended without congressional approval. That would almost certainly require 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster.\n\nWithin hours of McMahon's confirmation earlier this month, she shared a lengthy message with Education Department staff attempting to rally support for the department's unwinding, calling it \"our opportunity to perform one final, unforgettable public service to future generations of students.\"\n\n\"What's the end goal here? Destroying public education in America,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., in a statement. \"The effects of Trump and [Trump adviser Elon] Musk's slash and burn campaign will be felt across our state - by students and families who suffer from the loss of Department staff working to ensure their rights under federal law.\"\n\nIn an NPR/PBS News/Marist poll taken in late February, 63% of Americans surveyed said they would oppose getting rid of the department, compared with 37% who supported its closure.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, left, hugs U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon after he signed an executive order in the East Room of the White House on Thursday. Ben Curtis/AP hide caption\n\nIn a Thursday statement , the White House justified the department's closure, claiming that, since its founding in 1979, the Department of Education has spent over $3 trillion without improving student achievement.\n\nAccording to The Nation's Report Card , one of the oldest and most reliable barometers of student achievement in the U.S., reading scores changed little between 1992 and 2019, though math achievement improved considerably. The pandemic also wrought havoc on student achievement, with many learning gaps remaining five years after schools first closed to in-person learning.\n\nThese \"scores reveal a national crisis - our children are falling behind,\" said White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields in a statement to NPR. Trump's order, Fields wrote, \"will empower parents, states, and communities to take control and improve outcomes for all students.\"\n\nThe order declares, \"the experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars ... has plainly failed our children.\"\n\nFederal dollars make up a small fraction of public schools' funding - between 6% and 13%, according to a 2018 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The overwhelming majority comes from states and local taxes. And those federal dollars are largely intended to help schools serve the nation's most vulnerable students: those living in low-income communities, including millions of rural students, and children with disabilities.\n\nAt Thursday's signing, Trump said he would \"preserve\" those federal funding streams.\n\nThe Education Department is prohibited by law from telling schools what, or how, to teach. Nor does it coordinate or control how states and districts handle even fundamental subjects, like math and reading.\n\nTwo rare success stories from the recent Nation's Report Card - Alabama in math and Louisiana in reading - highlight just how much control states and local districts have over their educational destinies. After abysmal finishes in 2019 (Louisiana in fourth-grade reading, Alabama in fourth-grade math), both states implemented sweeping changes to help their districts improve - with a big assist from federal COVID relief funds. Both states showed remarkable improvement by 2024.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Ben Curtis/AP hide caption\n\nPresident Trump's push to \"return\" education to the states may end up hurting state education agencies and student outcomes in the long run, warns a former Tennessee Commissioner of Education.\n\nTrump signed an executive order Thursday instructing U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon to take steps needed to close the department \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.\"\n\n\"We want to return our students to the states where just some of the governors here are so happy about this,\" Trump said from the Oval Office Thursday, surrounded by several Republican governors. \"They want education to come back to them, to come back to the states, and they're going to do a phenomenal job.\"\n\nBut Kevin Huffman, who led Tennessee's Department of Education under former Republican Gov. Bill Haslam, says the move is misguided and could create confusion for state education agencies across the country.\n\nHuffman currently leads education nonprofit Accelerate that advocates for more tutors in public schools.\n\nHere are three thoughts Huffman shared with Morning Edition :\n\nStates already have independence on education policy.\n\nHuffman says the Trump administration's move is based on a \"false premise that somehow federal bureaucracy is the barrier and the reason why kids aren't learning more.\"\n\nHe adds that \"States already have lots of autonomy, and some use it well and some do not.\"\n\nStates have been able to allocate federal dollars with a fair amount of autonomy, Huffman said, adding that they \"certainly have lots of freedom in defining what their goals are, what their strategies are.\"\n\nEliminating the Department of Education may increase federal bureaucratic hurdles for states.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it would maintain federal funding streams for two of the Education Department's key programs: Title I, aimed at serving low-income communities, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which helps districts serve students with disabilities.\n\nState education agencies currently follow rules set by the education department for these programs that were created by Congress, Huffman said. The administration could shift implementation of both programs to other federal agencies, but that could cause some headaches.\n\n\"It probably creates more confusion on the ground from states that are used to having a single source that they're dealing with. They still have to follow all of the rules to ensure that the funding gets to the right kids, into the right schools,\" Huffman said.\n\nHuffman adds there is a public misconception about federal funding, and that it is \"not intended to just backfill state spending.\" He continued, saying \"It is intended to be directed at specific kids with specific needs.\"\n\nNot having a national action plan to improve education outcomes could backfire.\n\nHuffman said President Trump is right to call attention to the fact that reading and math scores are down.\n\n\"We peaked about a decade ago in reading and math scores in this country, and we need a national plan on how we are going to address this,\" Huffman said.\n\nThe Department of Education could play a key role in that, Huffman said, setting goals for increasing scores and ensuring students graduate with certain skills.\n\nThe department could \"identify the states that are actually making enormous progress on this, have them showcase the great work that they're doing, call to task the places that are not making progress and try to be a source for all of the information that only the federal government is really capable of gathering,\" Huffman said.\n\nBut the Trump administration plans to practically gut the office within the Department of Education that measures student performances across the nation. NPR reports that as of Friday, all but three of the National Center for Education Statistics' employees have been placed on leave , and will eventually be laid off.\n\n\"I feel like American competitiveness is in the balance,\" Huffman said, \"but the idea that our solution is going to be eliminating any national direction and national guidance and national plan feels like a bit of a surrender to me.\"\n\nThe radio version of this story was produced by Nia Dumas.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Ben Curtis/AP hide caption\n\nPresident Trump defended his administration's economic policy after he imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada last week and then rolled some of those levies back, causing what critics say is uncertainty for businesses and the broader economy.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News Channel's Sunday Morning Futures , Trump dismissed concerns over his back-and-forth tariffs and said they \"could go up.\"\n\nFox News' Maria Bartiromo asked Trump whether he expects a recession during his first year in office. The president couldn't say.\n\n\"I hate to predict things like that,\" Trump said. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of it takes a little time.\"\n\nThere are some signs that the economy may be headed toward a recession, but Howard Lutnick, the Commerce secretary, told NBC's Meet the Press there was \"no chance\" of one.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration said it would place a 25% tariff on cars and auto parts from Mexico and Canada. Soon after, the White House announced a one-month delay on the measure after carmakers Ford, Stellantis and General Motors called the president. During his interview with Bartiromo, Trump explained the move.\n\n\"This is short term and I felt for the good of the American carmakers,\" Trump said. \"I thought it would be a fair thing to do. And so I gave them a little bit of a break for this short period of time.\"\n\nCriticism from automakers notwithstanding, Sean Fain, the head of the United Auto Workers, called the tariffs an \"attempt to stop the bleeding\" in the American economy.\n\nTariffs \"aren't the end solution,\" he told ABC's This Week , \"but they are a huge factor in fixing this problem.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the stock market had it's worst week in 6 months with the S&P 500 dropping 3.1% and Nasdaq down 3.45%. Fox News' Bartiromo asked the president whether the uncertainty over tariffs - which many economist say is causing stocks to slump - will continue or if there will be clarity for businesses.\n\n\"Well I think so,\" Trump said. \"But you know the tariffs could go up as time goes by and they may go up.\"\n\nTrump also said he still plans to put  in place next month \"reciprocal\" tariffs against all trading partners that have tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\n\"April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal,\" he said. \"What they charge us, we charge them.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want,'\" Trump remembered saying . \"You got to pay.

He often referred to the spending targets outlined in charter agreements as requirements and derided countries for not paying enough.\n\nHe's been critical of western allies and cozied up to authoritarian leaders, like Russia's Vladimir Putin and Hungary's Viktor Orbán.\n\nBut Daalder's larger point, which is being echoed across party lines, is that Trump is reducing the importance of a 75-year alliance to the U.S. being an army for hire - and that NATO isn't something that is fundamental to U.S. security.\n\n\"A Trump return to the Oval Office means that an alliance like NATO, which is built fundamentally on trust, will suffer because people will not be able to trust Donald Trump to defend them if and when the emergency arises,\" Daalder said.\n\nWhat is new is the second generation approach to foreign policy by this battle-hardened Trump who has both the experience in the White House and a chip on his shoulder to take what he started in his first administration - and take it even further.\n\nNow, Trump has promised to fundamentally reevaluate the NATO alliance, reshape global trade and overhaul the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence services.\n\nHe has largely avoided explaining how he'd handle the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, yet claims he can settle the war in Ukraine in 24 hours.\n\nHe would be like a child without any parents to stop him from doing really bad things.\"\n\nJohn Simon, former Ambassador to the African Union\n\nFrom the campaign trail, Trump's raised concerns that the U.S. is paying too much to support Ukraine.\n\nHe's promised again to withdraw from the Paris Climate Accords.\n\nAnd he has floated the idea of a 10% tax on imports from all countries and a much higher tax on China, echoing at rallies that \"China is eating our lunch,\" to groans and applause.\n\nJohn Simon, who served as ambassador to the African Union in the Bush administration, worries Trump will dismantle key tenets of American foreign policy, including standing up to totalitarian aggression.\n\n\"My great fear is that a second Trump administration would have all the hallmarks of his first administration without any of the guardrails that were provided by the more experienced foreign policy folks who are around him,\" Simon said. \"He would be like a child without any parents to stop him from doing really bad things.\"\n\nIn this file photo, then-President Donald Trump, center, gestures as he walks off the podium after a group photo at a NATO leaders meeting in Watford, Hertfordshire, England on Dec. 4, 2019.

Peter Nicholls/AP/Reuters Pool hide caption\n\nDepending on who you ask - and where - Trump's return can elicit excitement, trepidation and even fear across the European continent.\n\nNathalie Tocci, a former top EU foreign policy adviser, says Trump had a \"fairly unifying effect on Europe,\" during his first term.\n\nAt the time, leaders rallied together during his first administration as the U.S. seemed to check out from the transatlantic relationship.\n\nBut the political landscape changed. European parliamentary elections this week saw a rise in far right parties.\n\nTrump's election could inflame those divisions. And Tocci said the potential of a second term has some keeping their heads in the sand, unable or unwilling to face that prospect again.\n\n\"So it's more like, you know, this kind of fear of something that is happening and you think is going to happen and you're more and more convinced that it will happen,\" she said. \"But it's so scary that you just prefer not to think about it.\"\n\nWithout mentioning Trump's name, President Biden nodded to some of those concerns while traveling in France last week for the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\n\"Isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today,\" Biden said.\n\nI often tell European colleagues there is more continuity to U.S. policy than we sometimes suggest because we personalize [politics].\"\n\nHeather Conley, former Europe aide, Bush Administration\n\nTrump has dismissed the criticism, blaming Biden and the foreign policy establishment for creating a more dangerous world.\n\nBryan Lanza, a former Trump aide who remains close to the campaign, says Trump was right to challenge NATO members to step up their defense contributions.\n\n\"The criticisms that exist here from the foreign policy community, you know, those are criticisms because they don't want change,\" Lanza said.\n\nIt's impossible to predict Trump's exact policies, which has increased feelings of uncertainty.\n\nStill, Heather Conley, who worked on European issues in the Bush State Department, says it's important to remember that many of the policies will be the same whether it's Biden or Trump.\n\n\"I often tell European colleagues there is more continuity to U.S. policy than we sometimes suggest because we personalize this,\" she said. \"And these personalities certainly have different approaches to allies very specifically.\"\n\nAs examples, she points to similarities in Biden and Trump's trade agenda and how Biden maintained the Abraham Accords, a key Trump victory.\n\nBoth leaders kept a strong relationship with Israel and a hawkish approach to China.\n\nDespite the differences in personalities oftentimes the status quo wins out over rhetoric.\n\n\"Underneath, sometimes the policy can look awfully similar,\" Conley explained. \"And so they're going to have to deal with the substance of that - with some exceptions - regardless of who is in the White House.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Judge largely blocks Trump's executive orders ending federal support for DEI programs\n\nBy\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nPresident Donald Trump talks to reporters as he signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on Jan. 23, 2025, in Washington. Ben Curtis/AP hide caption\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A federal judge on Friday largely blocked sweeping executive orders from President Donald Trump that seek to end government support for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nU.S. District Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore granted a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from terminating or changing federal contracts they consider equity-related.\n\nAbelson found that the orders likely carry constitutional violations, including against free-speech rights.\n\nTrump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all \"equity-related\" grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order requiring federal contractors to certify that they don't promote DEI.\n\nThe White House didn't immediately return a message seeking comment Friday evening.\n\nThe plaintiffs - including the city of Baltimore and higher education groups - sued the Trump administration earlier this month, arguing the executive orders are unconstitutional and a blatant overreach of presidential authority. They also allege the directives have a chilling effect on free speech.\n\n\"What's happening is an overcorrection and pulling back on DEI statements,\" attorney Aleshadye Getachew said during a nearly three-hour hearing Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that the president was targeting only DEI programs that violate federal civil rights laws. Attorneys for the government said the administration should be able to align federal spending with the president's priorities.\n\n\"The government doesn't have the obligation to subsidize plaintiffs' exercise of speech,\" said Justice Department attorney Pardis Gheibi.\n\nAbelson, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, agreed with the plaintiffs that the executive orders discourage businesses, organizations and public entities from openly supporting diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n\"The harm arises from the issuance of it as a public, vague, threatening executive order,\" he said during the hearing.\n\nAbelson's ruling does allow for the attorney general to investigate and prepare a report on DEI practices in accordance with one of the orders, but it blocks enforcement.\n\nIn his written opinion, Abelson found reason to believe the orders are unconstitutionally vague, leaving federal contractors and grant recipients with \"no reasonable way to know what, if anything, they can do to bring their grants into compliance.\"\n\nHe described a hypothetical scenario where an elementary school received Department of Education funding for technology access and a teacher used a computer to teach about Jim Crow laws. Or if a road construction grant covered the cost of filling potholes in a low-income neighborhood instead of a wealthy neighborhood, \"does that render it 'equity-related'?\" the judge asked.\n\nEfforts to increase diversity have been under attack for years by Republicans who contend the measures threaten merit-based hiring, promotion and educational opportunities for white people. However, supporters say the programs help institutions meet the needs of increasingly diverse populations while addressing the lasting impacts of systemic racism.\n\nTheir purpose was to foster equitable environments in businesses and schools, especially for historically marginalized communities. Although researchers say DEI initiatives date back to the 1960s, more were launched and expanded in 2020 during increased calls for racial justice.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs argued in their complaint that Trump's efforts to abruptly end such programs will cause widespread harm, not least because of the vague language in his executive orders.\n\n\"Ordinary citizens bear the brunt,\" they wrote. \"Plaintiffs and their members receive federal funds to support educators, academics, students, workers, and communities across the country. As federal agencies make arbitrary decisions about whether grants are 'equity-related,' Plaintiffs are left in limbo.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs include the city of Baltimore, which receives federal funds for public safety, housing, the environment, infrastructure and more, according to the complaint.\n\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, who won reelection last year, has championed efforts to increase opportunities for the city's most vulnerable residents, including people of color. Scott became the subject of racist attacks online last year as some commenters labeled him a \"DEI mayor,\" and he recently coined the phrase \"Definitely Earned It\" to highlight the accomplishments of Black figures throughout history.\n\nIn addition to the mayor and the Baltimore City Council, the plaintiffs include the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, the American Association of University Professors and the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which represents restaurant workers across the country.\n\nTheir attorneys claim the groups are already suffering the effects of the executive orders as Trump encroaches on the powers of Congress and seeks to suppress views he doesn't agree with.\n\n\"But the President simply does not wield that power,\" they wrote in the complaint. \"And contrary to his suggestions otherwise, his power is not limitless.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Supreme Court says Trump has absolute immunity for core acts only\n\nNina Totenberg\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has found that former President Donald Trump is partially immune from prosecution. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption\n\nIn a historic, consequential, and controversial decision on Monday, the Supreme Court granted substantial immunity from prosecution to former president Donald Trump on election subversion charges.\n\nThe decision almost certainly will delay his trial until after the November election, if it takes place at all. The vote was 6-to-3, with the court's Republican appointees all in the majority, and the Democratic appointees in fierce dissent.\n\nThe decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, established a broad new immunity from prosecution, not just for Trump, but for past and future presidents, too. Presidents may not be prosecuted for exercising their \"core\" constitutional powers, and even in situations where former presidents might be prosecuted after leaving office, they are entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for official actions they took as president.\n\nSuch immunity is needed, said the chief justice, in order to protect an \"energetic,\" and \"independent executive,\" willing to take \"bold\" actions and make unpopular decisions when needed. And while Roberts said that private actions by a former president are not protected from prosecution, his opinion seemed to inexorably intertwine private and public actions.\n\nThe court, however, did not itself resolve whether any of the election subversion charges against Trump could go forward; rather, the justices sent the case back to the trial court judge to determine whether any of the charges against Trump are sufficiently private to survive-in other words, not within his official purview as president. And it made it far more difficult to prosecute a former president by limiting the evidence a prosecutor could present.\n\nIn a brief statement to reporters on Monday, President Biden said that today's Supreme Court decision undermines the rule of law and sets a \"dangerous\" precedent.\n\n\"Today's decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what the president can do,\" Biden said. \"The power of the office will no longer be constrained by the law, even including the Supreme Court of the United States. The only limits will be self-imposed by the president alone.\"\n\nStuart Gerson, a Republican who served in high-level Justice Department positions, put the effect of Monday's ruling this way: \"It is impossible that this case will be resolved, if ever, before the election.\"\n\nIn short, he said, Trump got what he wanted: delay\n\nBut the former president actually got quite a bit more. The court made clear that if he is re-elected, he will be free to simply order the Justice Department to drop the charges against him , and that his pardon power is unlimited.\n\n\"Make no mistake,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a passionate dissent from bench, \"the majority gives President Trump all he asks for and more. ....Whether described as presumptive or absolute, under the majority's rule, a president's use of any official power for any purpose, even the most corrupt, is immune from prosecution\" under this decision, she said.\n\nEven the most private and non-official act-like bribery, she said-is insulated because the president is commander in chief, and under the court's rules laid down Monday, even if bribery charges are brought against a former president, prosecutors could not present evidence of a quid pro quo, she said. The money may have been the quid, but the quo was an official act which presumptively is insulated from prosecution.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett broke from her fellow conservatives on this important point, siding with the dissenters. \"The Constitution,\" she said, \"does not require blinding juries to the circumstances\" of a presidents official, and allegedly illegal, action.\n\nMany constitutional scholars had expected a split decision in Monday's case, but few anticipated such a big win for Trump and for Executive power.\n\n\"I just don't think anyone imagined that they would draw the line in a way that so clearly put a thumb on the scale for a President and for this particular former president,\" said NYU law professor Melissa Murray. For instance, she observed, the court seemed to say that any time the President talked to the Vice President, that conversation was presumptively immune from being disclosed to a jury, regardless of how incriminating it may have been.\n\n\"If I were in the Biden administration,\" Murray said, \"I would be running on this court's enormous capacity to stoke chaos.\"\n\nGeorgetown University law professor Stephen Vladeck seemed to second that view.\n\n\"The next president probably gets to pick at least two, if not three, justices. Do we want that to be Donald Trump or want that to be Joe Biden? he asked, adding that \"the court did nothing...to make itself less of an issue in the election.\"\n\n\"The originalists in the room were actually the liberals,\" said Yale law professor Akhil Amar, one of the country's leading constitutional scholars. He was flabbergasted by the decision, which he maintained is contrary to both the history and the text of the constitution.\n\nAmar said that the court, by barring any consideration of motives in a criminal case against a former president, violated both common sense and the words of the constitution.\n\n\"I don't love the criminalization of politics and going after ex-officials, but I think here they really created a Frankenstein, he said. \"There were ways of avoiding that without going nearly so far as they seemed to do.\"\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, speaking for himself alone, took an even more far-reaching position than the court's other conservatives. He would have held the position of special prosecutor in the Justice Department is unconstitutional.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Justice Sotomayor's dissent, but wrote separately, accusing the majority of planting \"the seeds of absolute power\" for presidents, who until now had been constrained by the law. \"If one man can be allowed to determine for himself what is the law, every man can,\" she wrote, in quoting Justice Louis Brandeis, and \"it invites anarchy.\"\n\nBoth Justices Jackson and Sotomayor did not end their dissents, with the usual, \"I respectfully dissent.\" Instead, they simply said they dissented.\n\nIn other actions Monday, the court dealt another severe blow to the power of government agencies to regulate. The key question in the case, Corner Post v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve , was when exactly the clock starts and stops ticking for challenges to government regulations. By a vote of 6-to-3 along ideological lines, the court ruled against the government, and sided with business interests in elongating the period for challenging a final government regulation.\n\nPreviously, the rule was that the six-year statute of limitations began when the regulation became final. But on Monday, the court said that the an injured plaintiff could file a challenge to a final rule at any time he was injured, as long as it is within six years of the injury, not six years of the rule becoming final.\n\nWriting for the conservative majority, Justice Amy Coney Barret found it troubling that under the government's contrary view, \"only those fortunate enough to suffer an injury within six years of a rule's promulgation\" could sue while \"[e]veryone else - no matter how serious the injury or how illegal the rule - has no recourse.\"\n\nThe upshot of the court's holding is that that businesses, individuals, and corporate entities can challenge federal regulations long after they were initially promulgated and still be within the statute of limitations. That would appear to put on steroids last week's decision abolishing so-called Chevron deference, which for 40 years deferred to reasonable agency regulations when a law is ambiguous.\n\nWriting in dissent for the court's three liberals, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson argued that by further opening the floodgates of litigation, Monday's ruling will increase the destabilizing effects of the court's decision last week to overturn the Chevron precedent.\n\n\"At the end of a momentous Term, this much is clear,\" Jackson wrote. \"The tsunami of lawsuits against agencies\" authorized by last week's decision and this one have \"the potential to devastate the functioning of the Federal Government.\"\n\nAnd in a third major decision, the court declined to issue a final ruling in a set of major cases that challenged whether social media platforms, like newspapers and TV and radio networks, have a First Amendment right to decide what material to put on their platforms.\n\nBy a unanimous vote, the court instead voided two lower court decisions and sent the cases back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Eleventh Circuit for further proceedings commensurate with the high court's instructions.\n\nWriting for the court, Justice Elena Kagan said that \"there is much work to do below on both these cases\" and importantly, at the same time, she signaled that social media companies do have First Amendment rights to moderate content. \"The editorial judgments influencing the content of\" Facebook's NewsFeed and YouTube's homepage are \"protected expressive activity,\" said Kagan. She explicitly added that 5 th Circuit's ruling, which upheld a ban on content moderation in Texas, \"was wrong.\" Texas, she said, \"may not interfere with those judgments simply because it would prefer a mix of messages.\"\n\nJordan Thomas contributed to this report\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images hide caption\n\nNow presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump addresses a campaign rally Wednesday in Anaheim, Calif.\n\nDonald Trump now has the support of 1,238 delegates - just a hair above the 1,237 threshold needed to clinch the Republican presidential nomination, according to The Associated Press.\n\nTrump was able to reach that number Thursday after 29 unbound Republican delegates told the AP that they would support him at the party's July convention. Fifteen of those unbound delegates came from North Dakota, seven from Pennsylvania, two each from West Virginia and Nevada and one each from Colorado, New Hampshire and Oklahoma (the unbound delegate who announced her support for Trump in this state is GOP chairwoman Pam Pollard).\n\nMost Republican delegates are bound by the results of their states' presidential primary elections but as many as 200 are not bound by those rules.\n\nFive states including California vote on June 7 with more than 300 delegates at stake. As the sole candidate left running on the GOP side, Trump will easily add to his slim delegate edge on that day.\n\nTrump is now the Republican Party's presumptive nominee; he won't be the official nominee until the July convention in Cleveland when delegates vote. But Trump reaching the magic number caps the businessman's unlikely presidential run and rise and avoids further talk of a possible contested GOP convention.\n\nAs NPR Political Editor Domenico Montanaro said on Morning Edition , Thursday's news turns the GOP convention into \"what it usually is, which is a wedding reception, essentially. ... it's going to be more of what you usually get.\" The unknown, of course, will be what happens outside the convention hall by way of protests. Previews of opposition to Trump were seen in New Mexico and California earlier this week.\n\nThe fact that unbound delegates are now supporting Trump, Montanaro said, is further evidence that Republicans are starting to fall in line behind the candidate. \"There were a lot of Republicans who had said that they were 'Never Trump' ... and that's just not the case. Now we're starting to see what are typical proportions - about 75, 80 percent of Republicans in polling saying they're going to get behind Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"The reverse is not true on the Democratic side at this point,\" Montanaro added, in part because Bernie Sanders is still winning states. \"Democratic unity hasn't quite happened in the way it has - or appears to be happening - on the Republican side.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

John W. Adkisson/Getty Images hide caption\n\nBillionaire Donald Trump speaks to a crowd at the 2011 Palm Beach County Tax Day Tea Party.\n\nDonald Trump is making the rounds on TV and in key states to explain that he may - just possibly - be interested in running for president.\n\nMany voters are taking his presidential aspirations seriously, but does Trump himself?\n\nWhen Barack Obama, then a senator, ran for president the first time, Republicans took out ads calling him a celebrity. But Donald Trump doesn't run away from that epithet - he embraces it. One of his NBC TV shows is called Celebrity Apprentice , for crying out loud. And all the powerful, no-nonsense business acumen he brings to kicking actor Gary Busey off the show right in front of Meat Loaf, he says he'll bring to, say, conflicts with the Saudis over oil. As he recently told ABC News, it's \"all about the messenger.\"\n\nAh yes ... the messenger. The developer has put together epic deals, but several of his companies have endured bankruptcy - the latest just two years ago - and he's a front man with just a slender stake in a significant number of the casinos and buildings that bear his name. This particular messenger is a showman at heart.\n\nHe's also flirted with politics before. Back on New Year's Eve 1999, Trump talked about the new millennium with NBC's Tom Brokaw, who asked him the seemingly unavoidable: Was he running for president? Trump told Brokaw that he was \"looking at it seriously.\"\n\nWould we take P.T. Barnum seriously if he wandered into a straw poll in Iowa? I turned to Jonathan Weisman, a veteran political reporter for The Wall Street Journal , for guidance. Weisman pointed me to polls showing Trump toward the front of the Republican pack. He reminded me that it's for the voters to decide whom to take seriously, and that in New Hampshire and Iowa, his candidacy is no joke among party activists most likely to vote in caucuses and primaries.\n\nA supporter of Donald Trump holds his hand on his chest while singing the national anthem at the 2011 Palm Beach County Tax Day Tea Party on April 16, 2011 in Boca Raton,  Florida. John W. Adkisson/Getty Images hide caption\n\nA supporter of Donald Trump holds his hand on his chest while singing the national anthem at the 2011 Palm Beach County Tax Day Tea Party on April 16, 2011 in Boca Raton,  Florida.\n\nBut there are reasons for caution. Trump has never run for office, and he hates scrutiny from the press. How much does he hate it? He once unsuccessfully sued a guy who wrote that Trump was worth only $250 million. Trump is also very aware of the financial disclosures required of actual candidates. He hasn't taken steps to create the on-the-ground organization typically needed to win primaries.\n\nDespite these apparent stumbling blocks, Weisman says Trump has other cards to play. He directed me to the Iowa Republican Party's web site , where I was greeted by a huge picture of Trump - hair, teeth and all - promoting his keynote speech at a June fundraiser. Weisman told me he was in the state Republican headquarters on the day Trump's appearance was announced. He says that the phones lit up, but at this point, you can't separate Trump's numbers from his fame .\n\nAs Weisman says, for all of Trump's insistence that he's serious, when he's interviewed, he'll wind up talking about Celebrity Apprentice and how high its ratings are, which makes it hard to tell whether he's \"boosting Donald Trump the celebrity television host or Donald Trump the candidate.\"\n\nThat show he can't stop talking about, by the way, would have to go away if Trump formally announced. For now, he's enjoying himself, boasting about his wealth to interviewers and tormenting senior Republican figures. For instance, Trump has given new life to the so-called birther movement by saying he's sent private investigators to Hawaii to investigate the facts of President Obama's birth there, despite a bounty of evidence proving it. George Stephanopoulos of ABC News pressed Trump about that the other day, and Trump insisted that it's \"not a big part of [his] campaign.\"\n\nBut in fact, it's a rallying cry in TV interviews and at public appearances, including a Tea Party event last week in Florida where he told the crowd Obama is \"unwilling and unable to show his birth certificate.\"\n\nSo look: If you're intrigued by a self-promoter with a Tea Party philosophy who's best known for plying his trade in the heart of Manhattan, you have your candidate. I'm talking, of course, about the Naked Cowboy, better known as Robert Burck, who can usually be found strumming his guitar wearing little more than briefs, leather boots, and a wide-brimmed hat.\n\nBurck actually says he's running , so that already puts him a step ahead of Trump. The Donald, the ball is in your court.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Growth has slowed in recent months, but gross domestic product still grew at a relatively healthy annual clip of 2.8% in April, May and June - which is faster than the pace in three of the four years when Trump was president. - Scott Horsley, NPR chief economics correspondent\n\n2. \"...from a safety standpoint, both gangs on the street...\"\n\nWe don't have great, up-to-date data on gang activity in the U.S., but violent crime trends offer a good glimpse into safety in the country. Nationally, violent crime - that includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault - has been trending way down after a surge in 2020, according to the most recent data from the FBI . That data is preliminary and incomplete, covering around three-quarters of the country, but other crime analysts have found similar trends. Crime levels, of course, vary locally : murders are down in Philadelphia, for instance, but up in Charlotte, N.C. - Meg Anderson, NPR National Desk reporter covering criminal justice\n\n3. \"...and frankly, gangs outside of our country in the form of other countries that are, frankly, very powerful. They're very powerful countries.\"\n\nThe U.S. is not in the \"most dangerous position\" from a foreign-policy standpoint than ever before. Biden pulled troops out of Afghanistan in his first year in office - though the withdrawal itself was chaotic and a target of much criticism - and since then, U.S. troops have not been actively engaged in a war for the first time in 20 years. The U.S. is supporting Ukraine and Israel, of course, and has troops in Iraq and Syria, but they're not fighting on any regular basis.\n\nWhat's more, however, FBI Director Christopher Wray has said the greatest threat to the country is domestic extremism . And beyond organized groups the very definition of extremism is changing, as fringe ideologies move into the mainstream, and radicalization takes hold amongst parts of the populace. Consider: the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and the assassination attempt on Trump's life, even with a motive that remains murky at best. Regardless, the call is coming from inside the house, domestic extremism experts warn. Many polls show a sobering degree of support for political violence to drive change. - Andrew Sussman, NPR supervising editor for national security\n\n4-5. \" We have a lot of bad things coming up. You could end up in a Depression of the 1929 variety, which would be a devastating thing, took many years- took many decades to recover from it, and we're very close to that.\"\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that a 1930s style Depression is on the horizon for the United States. And the Depression did not take \"many decades to recover from.\" It ended during World War Two , in 1941. - Scott Horsley\n\n6. \"And we're very close to a world war. In my opinion, we're very close to a world war.\"\n\nNo serious person thinks that the U.S., Russia and China are about to start a world war. Right now, Russia appears to be having a hard time defending Russia, given Ukraine's recent incursions. While there are concerns about things like the potential for regional conflagrations in the Middle East, only Trump is talking about world war. - Andrew Sussman\n\n7. \" Kamala's record is horrible. She's a radical left person at a level that nobody's seen.\"\n\nIt's debatable how liberal Harris is. Some in California didn't like her record on criminal justice and thought she was not progressive enough. She's clearly liked by progressives and her voting scores as a senator are on the liberal end of the spectrum, but is she \"radical left\" and \"at a level that nobody's seen\"? There are plenty of people alive and in history who would be considered far more liberal and more radical.\n\n8. \"She picked a radical left man.\"\n\nFew, if any, reasonable people would say Walz is a \"radical left man.\" He had a progressive record as governor with a Democratic legislature, but the things passed are hardly radical - free school lunch, protecting abortion rights, legalizing marijuana, restricting access to certain types of guns. All of these things have majority support from voters. What's more, that \"progressive\" record ignores Walz's first term as governor when he worked with Republicans because Democrats didn't control the legislature. And it ignores Walz's time as a congressman when he was considered a more moderate member given that he was from a district that had been previously held by a Republican.\n\n9. \"He's going for things that nobody's ever even heard of. Heavy into the transgender world.\"\n\nLast year, Walz championed and signed a bill that prevented state courts of officials from complying with child-removal requests, extraditions, arrests or subpoenas related to gender-affirming health care that a person receives or provides in Minnesota. \"Heavy into the transgender world\" is vague and misleading.\n\n10. \"He doesn't want to have borders. He doesn't want to have walls.\"\n\nWalz has never called for having no borders. He has voiced opposition to a wall because he doesn't think it will stop illegal immigration. He told Anderson Cooper on CNN , for example, that a wall \"is not how you stop\" illegal immigration He called for more border-control agents, electronics and more legal ways to immigrate.\n\n11. \"He doesn't want to have any form of safety for our country.\"\n\nTrump himself praised Walz's handling of the aftermath of the George Floyd murder at the hands of a police officer. And it's certainly hyperbole to say he \"doesn't want any form of safety for our country.\" Walz served in the U.S. National Guard for 24 years, so clearly, he's interested in the country having national security. And domestically, he's never been a \"defund the police\" advocate. Walz opposed a ballot measure that would have gotten rid of minimum police staffing levels, for example. That angered advocates. He signed police reforms into law , but that does not prove wanting no safety.\n\n12. \"He doesn't mind people coming in from prisons.\"\n\nWalz has not said he wants people coming in from prisons. Trump is trying to tie his claim that other countries are sending prisoners to the United States to Democrats' immigration policies.\n\n13. \"And neither does she, I guess. Because she's not, she couldn't care less.\"\n\nHarris has said a lot to the contrary of not caring about the levels of migrants coming across the border, let alone people coming in from prisons. In fact, when in Guatemala, she said her message for people thinking of immigrating to the United States was: \" Do not come. Do not come .\"\n\n14. \"She's the border czar. By the way, she was the border czar, 100%. And all of a sudden, for the last few weeks, she's not the border czar anymore, like nobody ever said it.\"\n\nHarris was never appointed \"border czar.\" That's a phrase that was used incorrectly by some media outlets. Biden tasked Harris with leading the \" diplomatic effort \" with leaders in Central American countries, where many migrants are coming from.\n\nBiden said he wants Harris \"to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle and the countries that help - are going to need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border.\" He added that Harris \"agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept - the returnees, and enhance migration enforcement at their borders - at their borders.\"\n\nHarris herself that day spoke of \"the need to address root causes for the migration that we've been seeing.\"\n\n15. \"We have a very, very sick country right now. You saw the other day with the stock market crashing. That was just the beginning. That was just the beginning.\"\n\nThe stock market did not \"crash.\" The stock market fell sharply at the end of last week as investors fretted about a softening job market. This was amplified on Monday when Japan's stock market tumbled 12%, sparking a selloff around the world. Stocks in Japan and elsewhere have since regained much of this ground, however. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 683 points on the day of Trump's news conference. - Scott Horsley\n\n16. \"Fortunately, we've had some very good polls over the last fairly short period of time.\"\n\nMost good polls have shown Harris gaining not just nationally, but also in the swing states, though these same polls show a very close race.\n\n17. \"Rasmussen came out today. We're substantially leading.\"\n\nTrump is not substantially leading, and Rasmussen is viewed as one of the least credible pollsters in the country.\n\n18. \"And others came out today that we're leading, and in some cases, substantially, I guess, MSNBC came out, or CNBC came out also, with a poll that was, you know, has us leading.\"\n\nPolls have not shown substantial leads. CNBC had Trump leading by 2, unchanged from his 2-point lead in July.\n\n19. \"And leading fairly big in swing states. In some polls, I'm leading very big in swing states... .\"\n\nAgain, polls in swing states have shown a tightened race.\n\n20. \"But as a border czar, she's been the worst border czar in history, in the world history.\"\n\nVice President Harris was never asked to lead immigration policy. That's the job of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Again, the term \"border czar\" was used inaccurately by some media outlets, and it's a term conservatives have been using to attack her, in part, because she has only visited the Southern U.S. border a few times since 2021. But in reality, Harris was tapped by President Biden to address the root causes of migration . Her approach has focused on deterrence. She's told migrants to not come to the U.S., and she has been able to secure more than $5 billion in commitments from private companies to help boost the economy in Central American countries. - Sergio Martínez-Beltrán, NPR immigration correspondent based in Texas\n\n21. \"I think the number is 20 million, but whether it's 15 or 20, it's numbers that nobody's ever heard before. 20 million people came over the border in the last- during the Biden-Harris administration. Twenty-million people. And it could be very much higher than that. Nobody really knows what the number is.\"\n\nIt's unclear where Trump is getting this number from. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection , since 2021 agents have had more than 7.3 million encounters nationwide with migrants trying to cross into the country illegally. Under Biden, unlawful crossings hit an all-time high last year, but that number has decreased significantly, in part, due to Biden's asylum restrictions at the Southern U.S. border. An April report from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics found there's nearly 11 million unauthorized migrants in the country. - Sergio Martínez-Beltrán\n\n22. \"Just like far more people were killed in the Ukraine-Russia war than you have reported.\"\n\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine is revealing its own casualty figures, so there are only very broad estimates. - Andrew Sussman\n\n23. \"A lot of great things would have happened, but now you have millions and millions of dead people. And you have people dying financially, because they can't buy bacon; they can't buy food; they can't buy groceries; they can't do anything. And they're living horribly in our country right now.\"\n\nGrocery prices actually jumped sharply during Trump's last year in office, as pandemic lockdowns disrupted the food supply chain and Americans were suddenly forced to eat more of their meals at home. Grocery inflation in June 2020 hit 5.6%. This was masked, however, by a plunge in other prices, as the global economy fell into pandemic recession.\n\nAs the economy rebounded, prices did, too. Inflation began to rise in 2021, and spiked in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent food and energy prices soaring. Inflation has since moderated, falling from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3% in June 2024 . (July's inflation figures will be released next week.) Grocery prices have largely leveled off in the last year, although they remain higher than they were before the pandemic - a potent reminder of the rising cost of living.\n\nEconomists have warned that Trump's proposed import tariffs and immigration restrictions could result in higher inflation in the years to come. Researchers from the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate the tariffs alone would cost the typical family about $1,700 a year . - Scott Horsley\n\n24. \"We've agreed with NBC, fairly full agreement, subject to them, on Sept. 10th.\"\n\nThis is ABC, not NBC.\n\n25. \"She can't do an interview. She's barely competent and she can't do an interview.\"\n\nHarris hasn't done interviews since getting into the campaign, but she has done them in the past, so saying \"she can't do\" one or that she is \"barely competent\" are just insults. Trump tends to revert to questioning the intelligence of Black women who challenge him. In fact, Trump did it nine times in this news conference, saying either Harris is not that \"smart\" (five times) \"incompetent\" (three times) or \"barely competent,\" as he did here.\n\n26-27. \"Why is it that millions of people were allowed to come into our country from prisons, from jails, from mental institutions, insane asylums, even insane asylums, that's a- it's a mental institution on steroids. That's what it is.\"\n\nImmigration experts have said they have not been able to find any evidence of this. Adam Isacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, told FactCheck.org : \"It's hard to prove a negative - nobody's writing a report saying, 'Ecuador is not opening its mental institutions' - but what I can say is that I work full-time on migration, am on many coalition mailing lists, correspond constantly with partners in the region, and scan 300+ RSS feeds and Twitter lists of press outlets and activists region wide, and I have not seen a single report indicating that this is happening. ... As far as I can tell, it's a total fabrication.\"\n\nNotably, a version of this did happen in 1980 during the Mariel boatlift from Cuba . The Washington Post noted three years later: \"Back in 1980, it seemed to be a humanitarian and patriotic gesture to accept provisionally, without papers or visas, all those fleeing from the port of Mariel. More than 125,000 came. Most were true refugees, many had families here, and the great majority has settled into American communities without mishap. But the Cuban dictator played a cruel joke. He opened his jails and mental hospitals and put their inmates on the boats too.\"\n\nWithout a question, some migrants who have come into the U.S. have committed crimes, but the data show the vast majority do not. According to Northwestern University , immigrants are less likely to commit a crime than U.S.-born people and certainly at no higher rates that the population writ large. (Trump goes on to repeat this claim minutes later in the news conference as well, so it is included in our count here.)\n\n28. \"We have a president that's the worst president in the history of our country.\"\n\nTrump may have this opinion, but he says it as if it's fact, and a 2022 survey of historians ranked Biden in the top half of presidents. Trump, on the other hand, was No. 43. The two below Trump were James Buchanan, who did little to stop the impending U.S. Civil War, and the impeached and nearly convicted Andrew Johnson.\n\n29. \"We have a vice president who is the least admired, least respected, and the worst vice president in the history of our country.\"\n\nA recent rating of vice presidents did not show this. Harris was in the bottom half of vice presidents, but Spiro Agnew, Dan Quayle, Henry A. Wallace and were toward the bottom of the list.\n\n30. \"The most unpopular vice president.\"\n\nThis might have been true about a year ago or so, but not anymore. An NBC poll then showed Harris had the lowest favorability rating of any modern VP they'd tested. But her numbers have turned around. The NPR poll had Harris with a 46%/48% favorable to unfavorable rating, which was higher than Trump's and his running mate, JD Vance, who is among the least popular running mates in recent history .\n\n31. \"Don't forget, she was the first one defeated. As I remember it, because I watched it very closely, but she was the first one.\"\n\nHarris was not \"defeated,\" because she dropped out of the Democratic presidential race before Iowa. But even if one considers her dropping out on Dec. 3, 2019, a defeat, she was not the first of the Democratic candidates in that primary campaign to do so. At least 10 others dropped out sooner .\n\n32-34. \"And I'm no Biden fan, but I'll tell you what, from a constitutional standpoint, from any standpoint you're looking at, they took the presidency away. ... And they took it away.\"\n\nThere's nothing in the U.S. Constitution about picking presidential candidates. This is a party process, and everything has been done within party rules. And, again, the presidency wasn't taken away: Biden is still president.\n\n35. \"They said they're going to use the 25th Amendment.\"\n\nThis was never floated as a possibility to get Biden to withdraw from the race. Biden's Cabinet members are all people he appointed and who are loyal to him. In addition, the 25th Amendment outlines a procedure for removing a sitting president from office, not from running for a second term.\n\n36-39. \"They're going to hit you hard. 'Either we can do it the nice way. I heard, I know exactly, because I know a lot of people on the other side, believe it or not. And, they said, 'We'll do it the nice way, or we'll do it the hard way.' And he said, 'All right.\"\n\nThis was not said; he did not hear; no Democrats in the know are talking to Trump; and this dialogue is made up.\n\n40. \"We're leading, we're leading.\"\n\nThe race is statistically tied in national polls and in the states. In some national polls, Harris leads. In some, Trump does.\n\n41-42. \"I'm saying it's a-, for a country with a Constitution that we cherish, we cherish this Constitution to have done it this way is pretty severe, pretty horrible. ... But to just take it away from him, like he was a child.\"\n\nAgain, this is Trump talking about how Biden stepped aside, and there's nothing in the Constitution about how the political parties should pick candidates. And nothing was taken away.\n\n43-46. \"And he's a very angry man right now, I can tell you that. He's not happy with Obama, and he's not happy with Nancy Pelosi. Crazy Nancy, she is crazy, too. She's not happy with any of the people that told him that you've gotta leave. He's very unhappy, very angry, and I think he, He also blames her. He's trying to put up a good face, but it's a very bad thing in terms of a country when you do that. I'm not a fan of his, as you probably have noticed, and he had a rough debate, but that doesn't mean that you just take it away like that.\"\n\nTrump can't speak to Biden's state of mind; all evidence is that Nancy Pelosi is perfectly sane - see her recent multiple rounds of interviews about her book, including with NPR ; again, Trump doesn't know Biden's state of mind; and again, nobody took it away.\n\n47-51. \"She's trying to say she had nothing to do with the border. She had everything. She was appointed to head the border. And then they said border czar. Oh, she loved that name. She loved that name. But she never went there. She went to a location once along the border, but that was a location that you would love to go and have dinner with your husband or whoever. That was a location that was not part of the problem. That was not really going to the border. So I- essentially she never went to the border.\"\n\n(1) As previously noted, she was not put in charge of the border and certainly did not have \"everything\" to do with it; (2) she was not appointed to head the border; (3) if \"they\" is the White House, then \"they\" did not call her \"border czar\"; (4) Trump doesn't know what Harris might have thought about the term; (5) Harris did not go to a place at the border \"you would love to go and have dinner with your husband or whoever.\"\n\nIn 2021, Harris toured border patrol facilities in El Paso, Texas, visited an area where asylum seekers were screened, and met with migrants. Republicans criticized her at the time for not going to the Rio Grande Valley.\n\n52. \"Now we have the worst border in the history of the world.\"\n\nWorld history is filled with cases where one country has crossed a border and invaded a neighboring country.\n\n53. \"She destroyed San Francisco. She destroyed California as the A.G. But as the D.A. She destroyed it. She- San Francisco. ... She destroyed- no cash bail, weak on crime, uh, she's terrible.\"\n\nAs San Francisco's district attorney from 2004 to 2011, and then California's attorney general until 2017, it's true that Kamala Harris was deeply connected to how crime was prosecuted during that particular period. However, no single person is responsible for destroying any city or state, not to mention that both are not destroyed.\n\nThere are just too many factors that contribute to why crime rises and falls. What's more, according to the FBI , both violent and property crime rates in California more or less mirrored national trends during her tenures. As a prosecutor, Harris was largely seen as aligning more with law-and-order tendencies, though she has supported some progressive reforms, like offering certain criminal defendants drug treatment instead of going to trial. She also tweeted support for a Minnesota bail fund after the 2020 protests of George Floyd's murder. - Meg Anderson\n\nDuring her campaign for the 2020 nomination, she rolled out a plan that would have phased out cash bail , and she pledged to eliminate it as president because \"no one should have to sit in jail for days or even years because they don't have the money to pay bail.\" But in the same campaign, during a debate, former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard criticized Harris for keeping cash bail in place as district attorney.\n\n54. \"And yet they weaponized the system against me.\"\n\nThe justice system was not weaponized against Trump. Biden went through pains to not show any interference with the Justice Department. And Trump was found guilty by a jury of his peers in New York in a state case.\n\n55-58. \"I won the big case in Florida. I won the big case. ... Nobody even wrote about it. The big case.\"\n\n(1) Trump did not \"win\" the classified documents case against him in Florida; (2) this was not \"the big case\" against him; (3) there was plenty of coverage of it; and (4) he goes on to repeat that he won the case later.\n\nFor context: the judge in the case controversially dismissed it, claiming the special counsel was unconstitutionally appointed despite Supreme Court decisions upholding independent counsels. The Justice Department has signaled it will appeal by the end of August but by the time the decision comes back, the election will be over.\n\nTrump had four criminal cases against him including the classified documents case - the fraudulent business practices case in New York, for which he was convicted on 34 felony counts; an election interference case in Georgia; and the other federal case dealing with Jan. 6. If there was a biggest case, it was the last one.\n\n59. \"The judge was a brilliant judge, and all they do is they play the ref with the judges. But this judge was a fair but brilliant judge.\"\n\nThere has been lots of criticism of the judge in the case, Aileen Cannon, who Trump appointed. She had very little experience as a trial judge, made several decisions that were questioned by legal experts and early in this case, had a ruling, in which she called for a special master to review classified documents first, overturned by the 11th Circuit.\n\n60. \"Now Biden lost it because he didn't have presidential immunity. He didn't have the Presidential Records Act. He lost it.\"\n\nThis was not \"Biden's case.\" It was to be tried by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland. The Biden White House has made efforts to keep an arms-length distance from the investigation. Biden often declined to comment on the Justice Department's and state investigations into Trump when it would likely have been politically advantageous for him to talk about it on the campaign trail.\n\n61. \"But the- I call it prosecutors, special counsel, special prosecutor to me. He-, appointed by him and appointed by Garland. He said the man's incompetent. He can't stand trial, but he can run for president.\"\n\nThis appears to be a misrepresentation of what special counsel Robert Hur said of Biden in a report he released investigating the president's handling of classified documents. Hur said he wouldn't be charging Biden, called the president \"an elderly man with a poor memory\" and said a jury might find sympathy with him because of it. He did not say Biden was incompetent and could not stand trial.\n\n62. \"She couldn't pass her bar exam.\"\n\nThis is false. Harris passed her bar exam on the second try . She failed on first attempt, which is not unusual for California's bar exam given its difficulty.\n\n63. \"I was doing very well with Black voters, and I still am. I seem to be doing very well with Black males. This is according to polls, as you know.\n\nTrump was not doing \"very well\" with Black voters. Biden was not doing as well with Black voters as he did in 2020, according to most surveys, but that didn't mean Black voters were moving heavily toward Trump. Many seemed more likely not to vote. There were signs that Trump was doing better with Black men, but there wasn't much good evidence to support this in polling, considering most national polls have such high margins of error with voter groups. A typical national survey might have 1,000 voters and 100 or so Black voters, give or take. That's typically a margin of error upward of +/- 10 percentage points, meaning results could be a whopping 10 points higher or lower.\n\n64. \"Extremely well with Hispanic.\"\n\nLike with Black voters, it's difficult to tell in most national surveys exactly how well a candidate is doing with Latino voters because of high margins of error. \"Extremely well\" depends on how it's defined, but this is an exaggeration.\n\n65. \"Jewish voters, way up.\"\n\nJewish voters traditionally vote roughly 2-to-1 for Democrats in presidential elections, so this seems more like a hope than reality.\n\n66. \"White males, way up. White males have gone through the roof. White males, way up.\"\n\nIt's just not the case that Trump is \"way up.\" NPR polling finds that while Trump is doing as well as ever with white men without college degrees, Harris - and Biden before her - is actually leading with white men with college degrees, a group Trump won in 2020, according to exit polls .\n\n67. \"It could be that I'll be affected somewhat with Black females. Well, we're doing pretty well. And I think ultimately they'll like me better, because I'm gonna give them security, safety and jobs.\"\n\nTrump is not doing well with Black females. Black women are a key pillar Democratic voting group, and Black voters have moved more in Harris' favor since she's gotten in.\n\n69. \"We have a very bad economy right now. We could, we could literally be on the throes of a depression. Not recession, a Depression. And they can't have that. They can't have that.\"\n\nThis is not the case. See earlier fact check. (He repeats this again later in the press conference, so it is included here in the count.)\n\n70. \"I know Josh Shapiro. He's a terrible guy. And he's not very popular with anybody.\"\n\nA Fox News poll last month showed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a finalist to be Harris' running mate, had a 61% approval rating in the state. Other polls also found him with a net-positive rating, though, not quite as high.\n\n71. \"Listen, I had 107,000 people in New Jersey. You didn't report it.\"\n\nIt was reported that the numbers come from faulty information about the size of a crowd at Trump's rally. More accurate estimates appear to be anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000 . Still, a very large crowd, but Trump is exaggerating here.\n\n72-77. \"What did she have yesterday? 2,000 people? If I ever had 2,000 people, you'd say my campaign is finished. It's so dishonest, the press. ... When she gets 1,500 people, and I saw it yesterday on ABC, which they said, 'Oh, the crowd was so big.' ... I have 10 times, 20 times, 30 times the crowd size. And no, they never say the crowd was big. ... I think it's so terrible when you say, 'Well she has 1,500 people, 1,000 people,' and they talk about, oh, the enthusiasm.\"\n\n(1-3) Trump gave at least three incorrect estimates here, downplaying Harris' crowd sizes (2,000, 1,500 and 1,000); (4) He also far overestimated how big his crowd sizes are compared to Harris'; (5-6) He twice said the press is dishonest about her crowd size and about his.\n\nFor context, the Harris campaign's estimate was 10,000 or more at each rally. What the exact number is might be unclear - as is often the case with crowd-size estimates - but they were bigger than 2,000 and 1,500. Reporters have often commented on the size of Trump's crowds. Frequently, they are very large, certainly larger than ones that Hillary Clinton drew in 2016 or Joe Biden this year, but Trump also regularly exaggerates their sizes.\n\n78. \"If I were president, you wouldn't have Russia and Ukraine, where it never happened. Zero chance. You wouldn't have had Oct. 7th of Israel.\"\n\nThis is speculation, and that there is simply no way to know what would have happened in either case if he'd been reelected.\n\n79. \"You wouldn't have had inflation. You wouldn't have had any inflation because inflation was caused by their bad energy problems.\"\n\nAgain, this is speculative. Energy and food prices jumped sharply around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions on Russian energy. Gasoline prices in the U.S. hit a record high topping $5 a gallon. But domestic energy production has not suffered during the Biden administration. In fact, U.S. oil and natural gas production hit record highs last year. AAA reports the average price of gasoline today is $3.45/gallon. - Scott Horsley\n\n80. \"I don't know if you know, they're drilling now because they had to go back because gasoline was going up to $7, $8, $9 a barrel.\"\n\nOil and gas production has largely been determined by energy companies. They were disciplined about not expanding production when prices were low but have become more aggressive as prices climbed. While Kamala Harris opposed \"fracking\" for oil and gas during her 2019 presidential campaign, she now says she would not try to outlaw the practice - which is important in battleground states such as Pennsylvania. - Scott Horsley\n\n81. \"Everybody's going to be forced to buy an electric car, which they're not going to do because they don't want that. It's got a great market. It's got a market. It's really a sub market.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has set a goal of having 50% of new vehicle sales be electric by 2030 . It has primarily tried to achieve this through carrots rather than sticks, offering incentives to make electric cars more affordable, encouraging the development of electric charging stations and using the federal government's own purchasing power to create demand. - Scott Horsley\n\n82. \"We don't have enough electricity. We couldn't make enough electricity for that.\"\n\nA shift to electric vehicles will require a rapid updating and expansion of the U.S. power grid, according to the Electric Power Research Institute . However, as EVs become more efficient, the increased demand could be reduced by as much as 50% per mile traveled over the next three decades. - Scott Horsley\n\n83. \"The weight of a car, the weight of a truck, they want all trucks to be electric. Little things that a lot of people don't talk about. The weight of a truck is two-and-a-half times, two-and-a- half times heavier.\"\n\nElectric vehicles are typically heavier than gasoline-powered vehicles, because of the batteries. But the weight difference is about 30% , not 250% as Trump said. What's more, American vehicles have been getting heavier for decades, long before the move to EVs, thanks to the popularity of pickup trucks and SUVs.\n\n84. \"You would have to rebuild every bridge in this country, if you were going to do this ridiculous policy.\"\n\nWhile many bridges and other transportation infrastructure need improvement , the additional weight of EVs is just one of many factors that will need to be considered. Another challenge is that bridges and highways are typically funded through gasoline taxes. The shift to EVs, which don't use gasoline, will require an alternate source of highway funding.\n\n85-90. \"So, but on crowd size in history, for any country, nobody's had crowds like I have, and you know that. And when she gets 1,000 people and everybody starts jumping, you know that if I had a thousand people would say, people would say, that's the end of his campaign. I have hundreds of thousands of people in, uh, South Carolina. I had 88,000 people in Alabama. I had 68,000 people. Nobody says about crowd size with me, but she has 1,000 people or 1,500 people, and they say, oh, the enthusiasm's back.\"\n\nThere were at least six different misstatements here - (1) Trump has had large crowds, but \"in history,\" there certainly there have been people with larger crowds, from Barack Obama and others; (2, 3) her crowds have been larger than 1,000, which he repeats twice; (4) no serious analysts have said this is the end of Trump's campaign. This race is very close; (5) there's no evidence for crowds of the size Trump notes in South Carolina and Alabama; (6) people do talk about Trump's crowd sizes.\n\n91. \"They wanna stop people from pouring into our country, from places unknown and from countries unknown from countries that nobody ever heard of.\"\n\nSomeone has likely heard of whatever the unnamed country is.\n\n92-93. \"We're leading in Georgia by a lot. We're leading in Pennsylvania by a lot.\"\n\nThe races in Georgia and Pennsylvania are within the margin of error, according to an average of the polls.\n\n94. \"So I won Alabama by a record. Nobody's ever gotten that many votes. I won South Carolina by a record. You don't win Alabama and South Carolina by records and lose Georgia. It doesn't happen.\"\n\nIt does, and here's why. Demographically, Georgia has become very different from South Carolina and Alabama. Georgia's population is now majority-minority, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Alabama and South Carolina are 64% and 63% white, respectively.\n\nGeorgia's Black population is also significant politically - 33% of the state's population is Black. By comparison, Alabama is 27% Black, South Carolina 26%. Latinos also make up 11% of Georgia's population and Asian Americans are 5%, both of which are higher than Alabama and South Carolina. And Georgia's population is marginally younger - 15% of Georgia's population is older than 65% compared to 18% in Alabama and 19% in South Carolina.\n\n95. \"If we have honest elections in Georgia, if we have honest elections in Pennsylvania, We're gonna win them by a lot.\"\n\nWinning them by a lot is highly unlikely, considering how close the states have been in recent elections, but perhaps more pressing is Trump's insinuation that there were voting problems in the two states, which there were not. That's why Trump is upset with Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, for example, because he upheld the valid 2020 election results even in the face of pressure from Trump.\n\n96. \"Of course there'll be a peaceful transfer. And there was last time.\"\n\nThis wholly ignores the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol, which took place because of Trump's election lies.\n\n97. \"Because I'm leading by a lot.\"\n\nAgain, this is a very close race.\n\n98. \"We have commercials that are at a level I don't think that anybody's ever done before.\"\n\nThis is false. Since Super Tuesday, Democrats have outspent Trump's campaign and outside groups supporting him by more than double, according to data provided by AdImpact and analyzed by NPR - $373.5 million to $150.6 million.\n\n99. \"She's not smart enough to do a news conference.\"\n\nThere is plenty of evidence that Harris is \"smart enough to do a news conference,\" as she has done in the past.\n\n100. \"We're in great danger of being in World War III. That could happen.\"\n\nAgain, no serious analyst believes this.\n\n101. \"I think those people were treated very harshly, when you compare them to other things that took place in this country where a lot of people were killed.\"\n\nThe Justice Department investigation into the events of Jan. 6, 2021, is the largest and most complex federal criminal probe in U.S. history, the attorney general has said. More than 140 law enforcement officers were injured that day, in what U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves has described as the biggest mass casualty event involving police. It's hard to find any comparable event in recent American history.\n\nAs of Aug. 6, 2024, according to Graves's office, prosecutors have charged more than 160 people with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer. Prosecutors have also secured convictions on the rarely-deployed charge of seditious conspiracy, or attempting to overthrow the government by use of force, against top leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.\n\nEven so, only a small number of Jan. 6 defendants have been held in federal custody while they await trial. Mostly, these are the rioters who allegedly used the most violence on that day more than three years ago. Republican members of Congress have toured the jail facilities and decried conditions there, expressions of support that defendants facing ordinary charges in D.C. have not received. - Carrie Johnson, NPR national justice correspondent\n\n102. \"Nobody was killed on Jan. 6th.\"\n\nConservatives were upset at the time that one of the rioters, Ashli Babbitt, was killed when she was shot by police, as she was trying to force her way into the Speaker's Lobby of the Capitol, which leads to the House chamber, with a crowd of others. Many officers were injured that day; one died of a stroke as a result of Jan. 6; and others later died by suicide that their families say was also a result of Jan. 6.\n\n103-105. \"And, you know, it's very interesting, the biggest crowd I've ever spoken to. ... The biggest crowd I've ever spoken before was that day. ... The biggest crowd I've ever spoken. ... I've spoken to the biggest crowds. Nobody's spoken to crowds bigger than me.\"\n\nIt was not the biggest crowd he's ever spoken to. His inauguration would have topped that. And others have had bigger crowds, as noted earlier.\n\n106. \"I said peacefully and patriotically.\"\n\nWhile Trump did utter those words, it is misleading. Trump also said the word \"fight\" multiple times , and he told the already angry crowd because of the election lies he fed them: \"We fight like Hell and if you don't fight like Hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Trump aides testified that he \"refused\" to tweet the word \"peaceful\" in the days leading up to the rally because he thought it might discourage people from being there, and he was concerned about his crowd size.\n\n107-108. \"If you look at Martin Luther King, when he did his speech, his great speech, and you look at ours, same real estate, same, everything, same number of people. If not, we had more. ...You look at the picture of his crowd, my crowd, uh, we actually had more people.\"\n\nFirst, the speeches did not take place at the \"same real estate.\" Trump spoke from a position just south of the Ellipse. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial\n\nSecond, the crowds were not the same size and Trump's was certainly not larger. It is an extraordinary claim and shows just how much Trump cares about crowd size.\n\n109. \"We have a Constitution. It's a very important document, and we live by it. She has no votes.\"\n\nAgain, there's nothing in the Constitution about how parties should pick their presidents.\n\n110-111. \"They said, 'You're not going to win, you can't win, you're out.' And at first they said it nicely, and he wasn't leaving, and then you, you know, the, you know it better than anybody. ... At first, they were going to go out to another vote, they were going to go through a primary system, a quick primary system, which it would have to be. And then it all disappeared, and they just picked a person.\"\n\nAs explained earlier, this is not how Biden wound up stepping aside. The story is yet another Trump invention. He also lies here in saying that \"they were going to go through a primary system\" and \"it would have to be\" a quick primary system.\" There's no requirement that a primary is held. In fact, for many years, candidates' selection as party nominees had nothing to do with primaries, and they were not as prevalent as today.\n\n112-113. \"That was the first out. She was the first loser, OK? So, we call her the first loser. She was the first loser when- during the primary system, during the Democrat primary system, she was the first one to quit. And she quit.\"\n\nAs explained earlier, Harris was not the first one out in the 2020 Democratic primary race. And \"first loser\" appears to be a name Trump made up at this news conference, as Harris has not been referred to that way as a result of her run for the 2020 nomination.\n\n114. \"She did, obviously, a bad job. She never made it to Iowa. Then for some reason, and I'm, I know he regrets it, you do too, uh, he picked her, and she turned on him too. She was working with the people that wanted him out.\"\n\nOnce again, this is a false conspiracy invented by Trump.\n\n115. \"She was the first one out.\"\n\nTrump repeats this false line again.\n\n116. \"I think the abortion issue is written very much tempered down, and I've answered I think very well in the debate, and it seems to be much less of an issue, especially for those where they have the exceptions.\"\n\nAbortion rights as a political and social issue has certainly not \"tempered down.\" There are millions of women, especially across the South, who do not have access to abortion and women who have experienced pregnancy losses with the inability to access medications for those necessary procedures.\n\n117. \"As you know, and I think it's when I look for 52 years, they wanted to bring abortion back to the states. They wanted to get rid of Roe v. Wade and that's Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, and everybody. Liberals, conservatives, everybody wanted it back in the states. And I did that.\"\n\nEverybody absolutely did not want that. It was actually quite unpopular for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe . And he again repeats that it has become less of an issue.\n\n118-119. \"I think that abortion has become much less of an issue. It's a very small.\"\n\n\"I think it's actually going to be a very small issue. What I've done is I've done what every Democrat and every Every Republican wanted to have done.\"\n\n\"I think the abortion issue has been taken down many notches. I don't think it's of- I don't think it's a big factor anymore, really.\"\n\nMinutes apart from each other, he repeats these three false claims. Abortion rights is not a \"very small\" issue for millions of voters. Democrats are organizing around it, and it has been seminal to Biden and Harris' campaigns.\n\n120. \"Previous to [Virginia Gov.] Glenn [Youngkin], the governor, he said the baby will be born, we will put the baby aside, and we will decide with the mother what we're going to do. In other words, whether or not we're going to kill the baby.\"\n\nThis is a distortion Republicans continue to push about what former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said. This has been fact-checked by others multiple times .\n\n121-122. \"I think the abortion issue has been, uh, taken down many notches. I don't think it's of, uh, I don't think it's a big factor anymore, really.\"\n\n\"Everybody wanted it in the states.\"\n\n\"But that issue has is very much subdued.\"\n\nHe once again returns to the issue of abortions, which remains a \"factor,\" not everybody wanted it in the states, the issue is not \"very much subdued.\"\n\n123-124. \" She wants to take away everyone's gun.\"\n\nHarris has not proposed taking away all guns. She has proposed banning assault-style weapons, something that was in place for a decade. Some surveys had shown majority support for this. Others show a split. (Trump makes this case later, as well, so that is also included in the count.)\n\n125. \"Some countries have actually gone the opposite way. They had very strong gun laws and now they have gone the opposite way, where they allowed people to have guns, where in one case they encouraged people to go out and get guns, and crime is down 29%.\"\n\nIt's difficult to compare gun violence and gun laws in the United States to other countries, simply because of the staggering amount of guns we have here. Although the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population, it holds almost 40% or more of the world's civilian-owned guns. And it has \"the highest homicide-by-firearm rate of the world's most developed nations,\" per the Council on Foreign Relations . Norway, Canada and Australia all tightened their gun restrictions after shootings. - Meg Anderson\n\n126. \"On July 4th, 117 people were shot and 17 died. The toughest gun laws in the United States are in the city of Chicago. You know that. They had 117 people shot. Afghanistan does not have that.\"\n\nThough Trump didn't get the numbers exactly right, Chicago did have an incredibly violent July 4th holiday weekend this year. According to Mayor Brandon Johnson, more than 100 people were shot and 19 of those people died. Chicago does have strict gun laws, in part because its state does: Everytown For Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for gun control, ranks Illinois third in the nation for the strength of its gun-control laws. However, no state or city exists within a bubble, and Illinois is surrounded by states with much weaker laws, including Indiana, which is just a short drive from Chicago. - Meg Anderson\n\n127. \"For 18 months, not one American soldier was shot at or killed, but not even shot at.\"\n\nThis is, to put it charitably, misleading. It appears that he's actually referencing the period when the Trump administration signed the deal with the Taliban, in advance of U.S. troops leaving. The deal said the U.S. would be out in 14 months, and in exchange the Taliban wouldn't harbor terrorists and would stop attacking U.S. service members. Needless to say, the deal didn't hold. But as the AP notes , \"There was an 18-month stretch that saw no combat, or 'hostile,' deaths in Afghanistan: from early February 2020 to August 2021.\" - Andrew Sussman\n\n128. \"Kamala is in favor of not giving Israel weapons. That's what I hear.\"\n\nHarris does not support an Israel weapons embargo. A Biden administration official posted on social media that Harris \"has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups.\" A leader of the uncommitted movement said Harris \"expressed an openness\" to a meeting about an embargo, but the Biden administration official said Harris \"will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law,\" not that she would support an embargo.\n\n129. \"She's been very, very bad to Israel, and she's been very bad and disrespectful to Jewish people.\"\n\nHarris' husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish. The couple has hosted Passover Seders.\n\n130. \"Well, I know Willie Brown very well. In fact, I went down in a helicopter with him. We thought maybe this is the end. We were in a helicopter going to a certain location together and there was an emergency landing.\"\n\nThis claim has not held up to scrutiny. Politico reported that Trump did have to make an emergency landing in a helicopter with a Black California politician decades ago, but it wasn't Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor and state assembly speaker. It was Nate Holden, a former Los Angeles city councilman and state senator.\n\n131-132. \"This was not a pleasant landing, and Willie was- he was a little concerned. So I know him. I know him pretty well. I mean, I haven't seen him in years. But he told me terrible things about her.\"\n\n\"He was not a fan of hers very much at that point.\"\n\nThis is something Trump repeated twice, minutes apart from each other. Brown strongly denies having been on a helicopter with Trump or telling Trump negative things about Harris, whom he dated in the mid-1990s and supports now for president. The relationship ended in 1995.\n\n133. \"Our tax cuts, which are the biggest in history... .\"\n\nThe 2017 tax cuts were not the biggest in history. As a share of the economy, they barely make the top 10 . They were big enough, however, to blow a big hole in the federal budget, which is why Trump was overseeing a nearly $1 trillion dollar annual deficit before the pandemic. - Scott Horsley\n\n134. \"It'll destroy the economy.\"\n\nThis is what Trump said will happen if his tax cuts are not renewed. But The 2017 tax cut did not deliver the economic boom that its supporters promised, and there's no reason to think reversing a portion of the cut would cause economic destruction. - Scott Horsley\n\n135. \"I've never seen people get elected by saying, 'We're going to give you a tax increase.'\"\n\nVice President Harris has echoed President Biden's pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000. However, Biden has called for raising taxes on wealthy individuals and raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% - halfway back to where it was before the 2017 cut. - Scott Horsley\n\n136. \"These guys get up, think of it. 'We're going to give you no security.' ...\"\n\nNo Democratic presidential candidate has advocated \"no security.\"\n\n137. \"We're going to give you a weak military... .' \"\n\nAn analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, showed a \"review of historical defense budget trends shows there is more at play in determining overall investments in defense than just which party is in the White House.\" Indeed, since the year 2000, U.S.-led wars overseas have resulted in a surge of spending by both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\n138-139. \"...We're going to give you no walls, no borders, no anything.\"\n\nHarris, Walz and the Democratic Party have never said they want \"no borders.\" They certainly oppose Trump's wall/fence along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, citing the exorbitant cost and its relative ineffectiveness, they say, compared to using other methods. (Trump later says that Harris wants \"open borders,\" so that's included in the count here.)\n\n140. \"...We're going to give you a tax increase.\"\n\nAgain, this is misleading and suggests Harris wants to increase taxes across the board when they have consistently talked about increasing taxes only on the wealthy. In Harris' view, those making more than $400,000 a year .\n\n141. \"They're gonna destroy Social Security.\"\n\nDemocrats have consistently advocated for keeping Social Security and making it solvent.\n\n142. \"They've weaponized government against me. Look at the Florida case. It was a totally weaponized case. All of these cases, by the way, the New York cases are totally controlled out of the Department of Justice. They sent their top person to the various places. They went to the A.G.'s office, got that one going, then he went to the D.A.'s office, got that one going, ran through it. No, no, this is all politics, and it's a disgrace.\"\n\nIn congressional testimony this year, Attorney General Merrick Garland told lawmakers that President Biden had never called him to discuss any of the cases against Trump. Garland also had aides review Justice Department leaders' email for any correspondence with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. In a letter to Congress in June 2024, the Justice Department said it had found no such contacts.\n\nIn that same letter, Justice Department legislative affairs chief Carlos Uriarte said the department did not \"dispatch\" former acting Associate Attorney General Matthew Colangelo to New York to join Bragg's team prosecuting Trump. \"Department leadership was unaware of his work on the investigation and prosecution involving the former president until it was reported in the news,\" Uriarte wrote. - Carrie Johnson\n\n143. \"Any time you have mail-in ballots, you're gonna have problems. ... We should have one-day voting; we should have paper ballots; we should have voter ID; and we should have proof of citizenship.\"\n\nTrump continues to spread baseless claims about mail ballots. There's no proof of widespread fraud with the voting method. When it comes to paper ballots, they're standard. One estimate found that in the 2024 general election, \"nearly 99% of all registered voters will live in jurisdictions where they can cast a ballot with a paper record of the vote.\"\n\nThe proof of citizenship comment echoes a Republican push on the issue , though studies have shown voting by non-U.S. citizens in federal elections to be exceedingly rare. The GOP-led House has passed a bill to require such documentary proof, but it's likely to go no further in a Senate led by Democrats who are opposed to adding new voting restrictions. - Ben Swasey, voting editor\n\n144. \"The polls have suggested, there are some polls that say we're going to win in a landslide.\"\n\nThere are no polls that suggest Trump will win in a landslide. By all accounts, this is a very close race.\n\n145. \"...they're paying 50, 60, 70 percent more for food than they did just a couple of years ago.\"\n\nThe rise in grocery prices is a common complaint , but Trump exaggerates the scale of the increase. According to the Consumer Price Index, grocery prices have risen 25% since before the pandemic and 21% since President Biden took office. (At the same time, average wages have risen 23% since before the pandemic and 17% since President Biden took office.)\n\n146-149. The Strategic National Reserve is \"virtually empty now. We've never had it this low.\"\n\n\"He's sucked all of the oil out.\"\n\n\"Essentially the gasoline to keep the, to keep the price down a little bit. ... But you know what? We have no strategic national reserves now. He's emptied it. It's almost empty. It's never been this low.\"\n\n\"They've just, for the sake of getting some votes, for the sake of having gasoline-. You know, that's meant for wars. It's meant for, like, tragedy. It's not meant to keep a gasoline price down, so that somebody can vote for Biden or, in this case, Kamala.\"\n\nThe strategic oil reserve is actually up in the past year . Biden has since repurchased about 32 million barrels of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As of this month, the reserve held about 376 million barrels of oil. The reserve was lower when Trump left office than when he got in.\n\n150. \"I see it right now, I see her going way down on the polls now.\"\n\nThe opposite is true. Harris has continued her momentum since getting into the race.\n\n151-152. \"...now that people are finding out that she destroyed San Francisco, she destroyed the state of California.\"\n\nAs addressed earlier, Harris is not entirely responsible for San Francisco or the state of California. Crime trends there were similar to national crime trends during her time as district attorney in San Francisco and as the state's attorney general. What's more, preliminary data for this year indicates that many cities in California, including San Francisco, are seeing murder rates falling. (Trump repeats the claim one more time later in the news conference, so it is included in the count here.) - Meg Anderson\n\n153. \"She was early, I mean, she was the first of the prosecutors, really, you know, now you see Philadelphia, you see Los Angeles, you see New York, you see various people that are very bad, but she was the first of the bad prosecutors, she was early.\"\n\nAlthough Harris did refer to herself in her 2019 memoir as a \"progressive prosecutor,\" her legacy has largely been seen as tougher on crime. She has supported some progressive reforms, such as pretrial diversion, which offers certain criminal defendants things like drug treatment instead of going to trial. - Meg Anderson\n\n154. \"You know, with Hillary Clinton, I could have done things to her that would have made your head spin. I thought it was a very bad thing - take the wife of a president of the United States, and put her in jail. And then I see the way they treat me. That's the way it goes. But I was very protective of her. Nobody would understand that. But I was. I think my people understand it. They used to say, lock her up, lock her up. And I'd say, just relax, please.\"\n\nTrump called for Clinton's imprisonment multiple times , including going along with crowd chants of \"lock her up.\"\n\n155. \"Don't forget, she got a subpoena from the United States Congress, and then after getting the subpoena, she destroyed everything that she was supposed to get.\n\nClinton aides requested emails be deleted months before the subpoena, and the FBI said there's no evidence the messages were deleted with a subpoena in mind. - Carrie Johnson\n\n156. \"I thought it was so bad to take her, and put her in jail, the wife of a president of the United States. And then, when it's my turn, nobody thinks that way.\"\n\nThe Justice Department closed an investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct some State Department business in 2016. Then-FBI Director Jim Comey gave a press conference to explain his reasoning in July of that election year. Comey said, \"We did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information,\" but he criticized Clinton and her aides for being \"extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information\" that flowed through the server.\n\nBy contrast, prosecutors in the Florida case against former President Donald Trump said Trump had flouted requests from the FBI and a subpoena for highly classified materials he stored in unsecure spaces like a ballroom and a bathroom at his Mar-a-Lago resort. The indictment in that case accuses Trump of unlawfully retaining government secrets and of intentionally obstructing justice with the help of an aide who moved boxes of materials and otherwise allegedly thwarted the FBI probe. Trump and his co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The Justice Department says it is appealing the district court's decision to toss the case on constitutional grounds. - Carrie Johnson\n\n157. \"A lot of the MAGA, as they call them, but the base. And I think the base is, I think the base is 75% of the country, far beyond the Republican Party.\"\n\nRounding up, Trump won 46% of the vote in 2016 and 47% of the vote in 2020. He has a high floor, but a low ceiling politically. Majorities continue to say they have an unfavorable rating of Trump, which has been consistent for years. No American presidential candidate has ever gotten 75% of the vote in this country, dating back to 1824 since data was kept for popular votes. Lyndon B. Johnson got 61% in 1964, Richard Nixon slightly less than 61% in 1972, Ronald Reagan 59% in 1984. Since then, Barack Obama got nearly 53% in 2008 and 51% in 2012, the first candidate since Eisenhower to win at least 51% of the vote twice.\n\n158. \"My sons are members, and I guess indirectly I'm a member, too.\"\n\nTrump here is talking about membership in the National Rifle Association. Another family member being an NRA member does not make someone else an NRA member \"indirectly.\"\n\n159. \"She served 24 years for being on a phone call having to do with drugs. You know who I'm talking about. She was great. And she had another 24 years to go. And it was largely about marijuana, which in many cases is now legalized, OK?\"\n\nPresumably, Trump is talking about Alice Marie Johnson, who had been convicted on cocaine conspiracy and money laundering charges . Kim Kardashian advocated for Johnson and won a pardon for her from Trump.\n\n160. \"They're either really stupid, and I don't believe they're stupid, because anybody that can cheat in elections like they cheat is not stupid.\"\n\nMore than 60 court cases proved there was not widespread fraud or cheating that would have made any difference in any state.\n\n161. \"Lately I've seen where they're trying to sign these people up to vote. And they have to stop. They cannot let illegal immigrants vote in this upcoming election.\"\n\nThis is a conspiracy not based in fact. Immigrants in the country illegally cannot vote in presidential elections, and there's no evidence there is an intentional effort to sign them up in mass numbers to sway elections.\n\n162. \"If you go to California, and you ask the people of California, do they like the idea of sanctuary cities? They don't like it.\"\n\nThe subject of sanctuary cities actually mostly splits Californians. Slim majorities have actually said that they favor the sanctuary-state law and are against their cities opting out of the law. Of course, this breaks down along party lines, and since California is heavily Democratic, those results might not be surprising. But it's more divided than Trump suggests.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Trump falls just below 50% in popular vote, but gets more than in past elections\n\nDomenico Montanaro\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump speaks during an election overnight event at the West Palm Beach Convention Center in Florida on Nov. 6. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump got very close to a majority of the vote in this presidential election, but not quite. It is not exactly the \" unprecedented and powerful mandate \" Trump claimed on election night.\n\nIn fact, this year's popular-vote margin is the second-closest since 1968 and still tightening. It shows just how closely divided the country is politically , and that any shift to the right is marginal.\n\nRepublicans are likely to have the same or a slightly smaller House majority as they have now, and despite new GOP control of the Senate, there is evidence that many Republicans in key states voted for Trump but not necessarily for Republican Senate candidates.\n\nWith 96% of the vote in, Trump has, according to the Associated Press, 49.97% to Vice President Harris' 48.36%, or 76.9 million votes to 74.4 million. ( The U.S. Election Atlas has a higher raw vote total and a slightly narrower margin, 49.78% to 48.23%, or 77.1 million votes to 74.7 million.)\n\nIt's the highest percentage Trump has received in his three runs at the presidency. (He got just less than 46% in 2016 and less than 47% in 2020.) Votes are still being counted, including provisional and overseas ballots across the country.\n\nThe 2000 election was decided by just 0.51 percentage points with then-Vice President Al Gore winning the popular vote but losing in the Electoral College to George W. Bush. The 2024 margin may very well get slightly closer, as the provisional ballots have favored Harris and they are coming from blue states like California, Oregon and New York.\n\nLoading...\n\nOf course, U.S. presidential elections are not decided by the popular vote; they are decided by the Electoral College. And on that score, Trump had a fairly wide 312 to 226 Electoral College victory, the widest since 2012.\n\nIn 2016, Trump also won in the Electoral College but lost the popular vote by 3 million to Democrat Hillary Clinton. A reason for Trump's popular-vote gains this time is that Harris was well below President Biden's 2020 vote totals in blue states.\n\nJust in New York and California, Harris was off Biden's totals by almost 3 million votes. And most of that was not vote-switching. In New York, Harris was off by about 900,000 votes, but Trump only gained about 200,000 from his 2020 total. In California, Harris got roughly 1.9 million fewer votes than Biden, but Trump only got about 60,000 more.\n\nOften turnout is lower outside of the states that get most of the political attention. This election saw the most political advertising dollars in the smallest field of states. Overall in this election, turnout was just slightly lower than in 2020 at about 63.8%, the second highest in the last 100 years.\n\nThis year, three of the top turnout states were those formerly Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Minnesota, Virginia and New Hampshire were also within 5 points and had been considered potentially competitive states.\n\nThe lowest turnout rates were in Hawaii, Oklahoma, Arkansas, West Virginia, Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, New York, Indiana and Alabama - all noncompetitive states, either very red or very blue.\n\nLoading...\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Trump threatens judge pressing DOJ for answers over El Salvador deportations\n\nCarrie Johnson\n\nThe chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., is facing calls for impeachment after blocking one of President Trump's immigration plans.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: The federal judge who hit pause on one of President Trump's immigration plans is attracting a lot of attention. Judge James Boasberg, of Washington, D.C., is facing calls for his impeachment simply because he ruled against the White House. NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been covering the judge for some time. She's here to spend some time with us and tell us what she's learned. Hey, Carrie. CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hey there. KELLY: Introduce us more fully to Judge Boasberg. JOHNSON: His name is James Boasberg, but his friends call him Jeb. He actually shared a house with future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when they attended Yale Law School together. KELLY: Wow. JOHNSON: And Boasberg served for more than five years as a prosecutor when he took on some of the toughest homicide cases in D.C. in the late 1990s. NPR spoke with a friend of the judge. His name is Ron Machen, and he shared an office with the judge back when they were prosecutors. Here's what Machen told me. RON MACHEN: You know, this is a guy and that's devoted his life to public service, that could be the managing partner of probably any firm in the city making millions of dollars. But he has devoted his life to serving people. JOHNSON: Boasberg first became a judge when a Republican president, George W. Bush, appointed him to the municipal court here in Washington many years ago. KELLY: So he was initially appointed by a Republican president. Interesting because the current Republican president is calling him, and I quote, \"a radical left lunatic.\" What has been his record on the bench? JOHNSON: I should note the Senate unanimously confirmed Boasberg to the federal court in 2011 during the Obama years. That vote was 96 to 0. And since then, he's ruled both for and against Donald Trump and Trump's interests. One of his biggest rulings as chief judge of the district court here in D.C. paved the way for a grand jury testimony by former Vice President Mike Pence. That was part of the investigation of Trump's role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. But the judge has also sided with Trump years earlier in a dispute about Trump's personal tax returns. And Boasberg also ordered the government to review thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails - part of an investigation into her use of a personal server when she was secretary of state. KELLY: Now, in this current moment, it's a case about immigration that has got the judge in the national spotlight. What's at stake in that case? JOHNSON: This is a fight over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. It's not clear how many of those men actually belong to that gang or that they had any prior criminal record. The judge has said these are really difficult issues because a president has a lot of power over immigration and national security. The judge did decide to put a temporary pause on the flights out of the U.S., but the government may have flouted one of his orders he gave from the bench to stop flights or turn around planes that already were in the air. KELLY: Right, and how's the judge responded? JOHNSON: Boasberg's been demanding some specific answers from the Justice Department about that, but DOJ doesn't want to provide everything the judge has asked for. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week tens of millions of Americans had voted for Trump's tough immigration plans. Here's more of what she had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: The judges in this country are acting erroneously. We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable. KELLY: And Carrie, as we can hear there, things have escalated really quickly to the point that there are now calls - including from the president - to impeach this judge, and the judiciary is pushing back against that? JOHNSON: That's right. A Republican lawmaker from Texas this week introduced articles of impeachment against Judge Boasberg. There have only been 15 impeachments of federal judges in history, mostly for things like taking bribes or corruption. And to actually remove a judge would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate. That won't happen given the math in the Senate this year, but even the threat of impeachment is a problem according to current and former judges. KELLY: And why is that? What are you hearing from people inside the judiciary? JOHNSON: Well, Chief Justice John Roberts actually took the rare step of speaking out to say impeachment is not an appropriate response when you disagree with a judge's decision. That's what the appeals process is for, he said. Trump allies are nonetheless proposing impeachment of at least half a dozen other judges who've ruled against Trump or the DOGE team this year. Judges tell me they're worried about this heated rhetoric. They are really worried that could lead to violence against themselves or their families. KELLY: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie.

That won't happen given the math in the Senate this year, but even the threat of impeachment is a problem according to current and former judges. KELLY: And why is that? What are you hearing from people inside the judiciary? JOHNSON: Well, Chief Justice John Roberts actually took the rare step of speaking out to say impeachment is not an appropriate response when you disagree with a judge's decision. That's what the appeals process is for, he said. Trump allies are nonetheless proposing impeachment of at least half a dozen other judges who've ruled against Trump or the DOGE team this year. Judges tell me they're worried about this heated rhetoric. They are really worried that could lead to violence against themselves or their families. KELLY: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie.

JOHNSON: His name is James Boasberg, but his friends call him Jeb. He actually shared a house with future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when they attended Yale Law School together. KELLY: Wow. JOHNSON: And Boasberg served for more than five years as a prosecutor when he took on some of the toughest homicide cases in D.C. in the late 1990s. NPR spoke with a friend of the judge. His name is Ron Machen, and he shared an office with the judge back when they were prosecutors. Here's what Machen told me. RON MACHEN: You know, this is a guy and that's devoted his life to public service, that could be the managing partner of probably any firm in the city making millions of dollars. But he has devoted his life to serving people. JOHNSON: Boasberg first became a judge when a Republican president, George W. Bush, appointed him to the municipal court here in Washington many years ago. KELLY: So he was initially appointed by a Republican president. Interesting because the current Republican president is calling him, and I quote, \"a radical left lunatic.\" What has been his record on the bench? JOHNSON: I should note the Senate unanimously confirmed Boasberg to the federal court in 2011 during the Obama years. That vote was 96 to 0. And since then, he's ruled both for and against Donald Trump and Trump's interests. One of his biggest rulings as chief judge of the district court here in D.C. paved the way for a grand jury testimony by former Vice President Mike Pence. That was part of the investigation of Trump's role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. But the judge has also sided with Trump years earlier in a dispute about Trump's personal tax returns. And Boasberg also ordered the government to review thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails - part of an investigation into her use of a personal server when she was secretary of state. KELLY: Now, in this current moment, it's a case about immigration that has got the judge in the national spotlight. What's at stake in that case? JOHNSON: This is a fight over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. It's not clear how many of those men actually belong to that gang or that they had any prior criminal record. The judge has said these are really difficult issues because a president has a lot of power over immigration and national security. The judge did decide to put a temporary pause on the flights out of the U.S., but the government may have flouted one of his orders he gave from the bench to stop flights or turn around planes that already were in the air. KELLY: Right, and how's the judge responded? JOHNSON: Boasberg's been demanding some specific answers from the Justice Department about that, but DOJ doesn't want to provide everything the judge has asked for. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week tens of millions of Americans had voted for Trump's tough immigration plans. Here's more of what she had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: The judges in this country are acting erroneously. We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable. KELLY: And Carrie, as we can hear there, things have escalated really quickly to the point that there are now calls - including from the president - to impeach this judge, and the judiciary is pushing back against that? JOHNSON: That's right. A Republican lawmaker from Texas this week introduced articles of impeachment against Judge Boasberg.

That's what the appeals process is for, he said. Trump allies are nonetheless proposing impeachment of at least half a dozen other judges who've ruled against Trump or the DOGE team this year. Judges tell me they're worried about this heated rhetoric. They are really worried that could lead to violence against themselves or their families. KELLY: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie.

NPR spoke with a friend of the judge. His name is Ron Machen, and he shared an office with the judge back when they were prosecutors. Here's what Machen told me. RON MACHEN: You know, this is a guy and that's devoted his life to public service, that could be the managing partner of probably any firm in the city making millions of dollars. But he has devoted his life to serving people. JOHNSON: Boasberg first became a judge when a Republican president, George W. Bush, appointed him to the municipal court here in Washington many years ago. KELLY: So he was initially appointed by a Republican president. Interesting because the current Republican president is calling him, and I quote, \"a radical left lunatic.\" What has been his record on the bench? JOHNSON: I should note the Senate unanimously confirmed Boasberg to the federal court in 2011 during the Obama years. That vote was 96 to 0. And since then, he's ruled both for and against Donald Trump and Trump's interests. One of his biggest rulings as chief judge of the district court here in D.C. paved the way for a grand jury testimony by former Vice President Mike Pence. That was part of the investigation of Trump's role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. But the judge has also sided with Trump years earlier in a dispute about Trump's personal tax returns. And Boasberg also ordered the government to review thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails - part of an investigation into her use of a personal server when she was secretary of state. KELLY: Now, in this current moment, it's a case about immigration that has got the judge in the national spotlight. What's at stake in that case? JOHNSON: This is a fight over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. It's not clear how many of those men actually belong to that gang or that they had any prior criminal record. The judge has said these are really difficult issues because a president has a lot of power over immigration and national security. The judge did decide to put a temporary pause on the flights out of the U.S., but the government may have flouted one of his orders he gave from the bench to stop flights or turn around planes that already were in the air. KELLY: Right, and how's the judge responded? JOHNSON: Boasberg's been demanding some specific answers from the Justice Department about that, but DOJ doesn't want to provide everything the judge has asked for. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week tens of millions of Americans had voted for Trump's tough immigration plans. Here's more of what she had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: The judges in this country are acting erroneously. We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable. KELLY: And Carrie, as we can hear there, things have escalated really quickly to the point that there are now calls - including from the president - to impeach this judge, and the judiciary is pushing back against that? JOHNSON: That's right. A Republican lawmaker from Texas this week introduced articles of impeachment against Judge Boasberg. There have only been 15 impeachments of federal judges in history, mostly for things like taking bribes or corruption. And to actually remove a judge would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate. That won't happen given the math in the Senate this year, but even the threat of impeachment is a problem according to current and former judges. KELLY: And why is that? What are you hearing from people inside the judiciary?

That vote was 96 to 0. And since then, he's ruled both for and against Donald Trump and Trump's interests. One of his biggest rulings as chief judge of the district court here in D.C. paved the way for a grand jury testimony by former Vice President Mike Pence. That was part of the investigation of Trump's role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. But the judge has also sided with Trump years earlier in a dispute about Trump's personal tax returns. And Boasberg also ordered the government to review thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails - part of an investigation into her use of a personal server when she was secretary of state. KELLY: Now, in this current moment, it's a case about immigration that has got the judge in the national spotlight. What's at stake in that case? JOHNSON: This is a fight over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. It's not clear how many of those men actually belong to that gang or that they had any prior criminal record. The judge has said these are really difficult issues because a president has a lot of power over immigration and national security. The judge did decide to put a temporary pause on the flights out of the U.S., but the government may have flouted one of his orders he gave from the bench to stop flights or turn around planes that already were in the air. KELLY: Right, and how's the judge responded? JOHNSON: Boasberg's been demanding some specific answers from the Justice Department about that, but DOJ doesn't want to provide everything the judge has asked for. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week tens of millions of Americans had voted for Trump's tough immigration plans. Here's more of what she had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KAROLINE LEAVITT: The judges in this country are acting erroneously. We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable. KELLY: And Carrie, as we can hear there, things have escalated really quickly to the point that there are now calls - including from the president - to impeach this judge, and the judiciary is pushing back against that? JOHNSON: That's right. A Republican lawmaker from Texas this week introduced articles of impeachment against Judge Boasberg. There have only been 15 impeachments of federal judges in history, mostly for things like taking bribes or corruption. And to actually remove a judge would require a two-thirds vote of the Senate. That won't happen given the math in the Senate this year, but even the threat of impeachment is a problem according to current and former judges. KELLY: And why is that? What are you hearing from people inside the judiciary? JOHNSON: Well, Chief Justice John Roberts actually took the rare step of speaking out to say impeachment is not an appropriate response when you disagree with a judge's decision. That's what the appeals process is for, he said. Trump allies are nonetheless proposing impeachment of at least half a dozen other judges who've ruled against Trump or the DOGE team this year. Judges tell me they're worried about this heated rhetoric. They are really worried that could lead to violence against themselves or their families. KELLY: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie.

What are you hearing from people inside the judiciary? JOHNSON: Well, Chief Justice John Roberts actually took the rare step of speaking out to say impeachment is not an appropriate response when you disagree with a judge's decision. That's what the appeals process is for, he said. Trump allies are nonetheless proposing impeachment of at least half a dozen other judges who've ruled against Trump or the DOGE team this year. Judges tell me they're worried about this heated rhetoric. They are really worried that could lead to violence against themselves or their families. KELLY: NPR's Carrie Johnson. Thanks, Carrie.

      "text": "Read President Trump's 2025 address to a joint session of Congress\n\nPresident Trump Delivers an Address to a Joint Session of Congress\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the first Lady of the United States, members of the United States congress, thank you very much. And to my fellow citizens, America is back. [Applause]\n\nCROWD: USA, USA, USA.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years and we are just getting started. [Applause] Thank you. I returned to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back, our spirit is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back and the American dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.\n\nThe American dream is unstoppable and our country is on the verge of a comeback, the likes of which the world has never witnessed and perhaps will never witness again. There's never been anything like it. The presidential election of November 5th, was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes.\n\n[Applause] We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country. [Booing]\n\nCROWD: USA, USA, USA.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: And won counties in our country, 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for republican. Now for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. In fact, it's an astonishing record, 27-point swing, the most ever.\n\n[Applause] Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump.\n\nMIKE JOHNSON: Mr. President. Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House and to cease any further disruptions. That's your warning. Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant at arms to restore order to the joint session. [Applause] Mr. Green, take your seat.\n\nTake your seat, sir.\n\nAL GREEN: [Off-Mic].\n\nMIKE JOHNSON: Take your seat. Finding that members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper decorum, the chair now directs the sergeant at arms to restore order. Remove this gentleman from the chamber. [Applause] Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House. Mr. President, you can continue.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Thank you. Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 executive orders and taken more than 400 executive actions, a record to restore commonsense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job and I'm doing it. [Applause] In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it's our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation by many.\n\n[Applause] And what makes it even more impressive is that, do you know who number two is, George Washington. How about that? How about that? I don't know about that list, but we'll take it. Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border and I deployed the US military and border patrol to repel the invasion of our country.\n\nAnd what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come, much easier that way. In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month and virtually all of them including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country.\n\nWho would want to do that? This is my fifth such speech to congress, and once again, I look at the democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded and these people sitting right here, will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements.\n\nThey won't do it, no matter what. Five, five times I've been up here. It's very sad and it just shouldn't be this way. So democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America. For the good of our nation, let's work together and let's truly make America great again.\n\n[Applause] Every day, my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future that America deserves and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action. Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations and a freeze on all foreign aid.\n\n[Applause]\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris climate accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. [Applause] I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization. [Applause] And I also withdrew from the anti-American UN Human Rights Council. [Applause] We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable.\n\nAnd importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction. [Applause] To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for everyone new regulation, ten old regulations must be eliminated. Just like I did in my very successful first term.\n\n[Applause] And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations. Like no other president had done before, we ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. [Applause] And we have ended weaponized government where as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. [Laughter] How did that work out?\n\nNot too good, not too good. [Applause] And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America. It's back. [Applause] And two days ago, I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America. [Applause] I renamed the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America.\n\n[Applause] And likewise, I renamed, for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley again. [Applause] Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. [Applause] We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military.\n\n[Applause] And our country will be woke no longer. [Applause] We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. Very important. [Applause] You should be hired based on merit. And the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you.\n\nThank you very much. Thank you. [Applause] We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools. And I signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. [Applause] I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports.\n\n[Applause] Three years ago, Payton McNabb, was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male. He smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career.\n\nIt was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery. And Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team, or they will lose all federal funding. [Applause] And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling where a male recently finished a long distance race, five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours.\n\nBroke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer. [Applause] What I have just described is only a small fraction of the commonsense revolution that is now, because of us, sweeping the entire world. Commonsense has become a common theme and we will never go back.\n\nNever, ever going to let that happen. [Applause] Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.\n\nUNKNOWN: Yes, yes, yes.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans. They've never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they're not sure. As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.\n\n[Applause] Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg price is out of control and we're working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that. You inherited a total mess from the previous administration. Do a good job. [Applause] A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy.\n\nThe previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95 percent, slowed pipeline construction to a halt and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now. [Applause] And frankly, we have never seen anything like it. That's why on my first day in office I declared a national energy emergency.\n\n[Applause]\n\nDONALD TRUMP: As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth and by far. And now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill. [Applause] My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. There's never been anything like that one.\n\nIt will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. The permitting is gotten. And later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA. [Applause] To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but we'll be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\n[Applause] And to that end, I have created the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE. Perhaps you've heard of it, perhaps, which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon. He's working very hard. He didn't need this. He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side appreciates it, I believe.\n\n[Applause] They just don't want to admit that. Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion, from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens; $45 million, for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma; $40 million, to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants.\n\nNobody knows what that is. $8 million, to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of. $60 million, for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America, $60 million. $8 million, for making mice transgender. This is real. $32 million, for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova.\n\n$10 million, for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million, for the Arab Sesame Street in the Middle East. It's a program, $20 million for a program. $1.9 billion, to recently created decarbonization of homes committee, headed up, and we know she's involved. Just at the Last moment, the money was passed over, by a woman named Stacey Abrams.\n\nHave you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million, consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million, for voter confidence in Liberia. $14 million, for social cohesion in Mali. $59 million, for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City. He's a real estate developer. He's done very well. $ 250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia.\n\n$42 million, for social and behavior change in Uganda. $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia. $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. I don't know what we're doing. Should use it ourselves. And $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education, the most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump administration, all of these scams and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them.\n\nThey're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud. [Applause] And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things, taken back a lot of that money.\n\nWe got it just in time. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, a federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors, and that our seniors and people that we love rely on. Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security numbers from people aged 100 to 109 years old.\n\n[Booing] It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139. 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149. And money is being paid to many of them.\n\nAnd we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck. Good luck. You're going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people because it just keeps getting paid and paid and nobody does--and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country. 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159. And over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old.\n\nWe have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby. [Applause] Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229. One person between the age of 240 and 249. And one person is listed at 360 years of age, more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. [Laughter] But we're going to find out where that money's going and it's not going to be pretty.\n\nBy slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft, we can find we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families. [Applause] And today, interest rates took a beautiful drop, big beautiful drop.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: It's about time. And in the near future, I want to do what has not been done in 24 years, balance the federal budget. We're going to balance it. [Applause] With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million, we will allow the most successful job creating people from all over the world to buy a path to US citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated.\n\n[Laughter] And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came. The money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that, but they have to pay tax, create jobs. They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country instead of having them be -- being forced out.\n\nNumber one, at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there. So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators, who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, we will now bring in brilliant hardworking job creating people.\n\nThey're going to pay a lot of money. And we're going to reduce our debt with that money. [Applause] Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years, the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits and held back America's potential in every possible way.\n\nThe nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take ten days to get instead take ten years, 15 years and even 20 years before you're rejected. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work.\n\nMy administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy. And we will restore true democracy to America again. [Applause] And any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately. [Applause] Because we are draining the swamp. It's very simple. And the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over.\n\n[Applause] And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there. They're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right, I don't mean the Republican right, but my right, right here, I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts.\n\nBecause otherwise, I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. [Applause] But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cuts. [Applause] Thank you. It's a very, very big part of our plan. We had tremendous success in our first term with it. A very big part of our plan.\n\nWe're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board. And to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation, I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors. [Applause] Thank you. Good luck. [Applause] And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America.\n\n[Applause] And by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like I've never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? [Laughter] That along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom.\n\nIt's going to boom. I spoke to the majors today, all three, the top people. And they're so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America. With Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world.\n\n[Applause] And this has taken place since our great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. [Applause] In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100 percent expensing.\n\nIt will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025. And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term. We had a great first term. [Applause] If you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff.\n\nAnd in some cases, a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades. And now, it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada, have you heard of them, and countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them.\n\nIt's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 percent. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea, but that's what happens.\n\nThis is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. [Laughter] That's what -- that's not -- just one day was -- cost us a lot of money. [Laughter] But we're going to do it in April.\n\nI'm a very superstitious person. April 2nd, reciprocal tariffs kick in. And whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. [Applause] Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. [Applause] If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market.\n\nThere's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in their market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China and I did it with others. And the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money, they can do anything about it. We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on earth.\n\nAnd we will not let that happen any longer. [Applause] Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\n\nAnd many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: They are, in fact, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars, and the United States will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer. [Applause] Thanks to our America-First policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies that people of SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200, billion investment.\n\nOpen AI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500, billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion, investment. Tim Cook called me. He said, I cannot spend it fast enough. It's going to be much higher than that, I believe. They'll be building their plants here instead of in China.\n\nAnd just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world, most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount, 97 percent of the market, announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the USA. [Applause] And we're not giving them any money. Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing.\n\nWe give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. We're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs, so they came in their building and many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money.\n\nWe just want to protect our businesses and our people. And they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIP Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to. Our new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer.\n\nI love the farmer. Who will now be selling into our home market, the USA, because nobody is going to be able to compete with you because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they heard our American farmers.\n\nThe tariffs will go on agricultural products coming into America. And our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period. We had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said just bear with me and they did, they did. Probably have to bear with me again and this will be even better.\n\nThat was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it, he didn't enforce it, $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great, but Biden did not enforce it and it hurt our farmers, but our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you too.\n\nI love you too. It's all going to happen. And I have also imposed a 25 percent tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel, because if we don't have as an example, steel, and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly, we just won't have a country very long. Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama.\n\nJeff Dennard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years at a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raised seven children with his beautiful wife Nicole and over the years, provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff.\n\n[Applause] Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs. They're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again and it's happening and it will happen rather quickly.\n\nThere'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that. It won't be much. No, you're not. Oh. And look and look where Biden took us, very low, the lowest we've ever been. Jeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, a very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States.\n\nMelania's work has yielded incredible results helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce. Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women, very impressive, Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the first lady's Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education and become a teacher.\n\nAnd Elliston Berry, who became a victim of an illicit deepfake image produced by a peer. With Ellison's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act and this is so important. Thank you very much, John. John Thune. Thank you. Stand up, John. [Applause] Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you and thank you to John Thune and the Senate.\n\nGreat job. To criminalize the publication of such images online is terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm going to use that bill for myself too, if you don't mind, because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody.\n\n[Laughter] That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you. But if we truly care about protecting America's children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States. Many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world.\n\nBecause of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies, they are now strongly embedded in our country, but we are getting them out and getting them out fast. And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you and Paul of Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they've all done, everybody, border patrol, ICE, all law enforcement in general is incredible.\n\nWe have to take care of our law enforcement. We have to. [Applause] Last year, a brilliant 22-year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning, Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized and horrifically murdered.\n\nLaken was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then set loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful, young angel.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: With us this evening are Laken's beloved mother, Allison and her sister Lauren. [Applause] Last year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th President mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. It's a very strong, powerful act.\n\n[Applause] It's called the Laken Riley Act. So Allison and Lauren, America will never ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. [Applause] Thank you very much. Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history. And we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded.\n\nThank you. [Applause] The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation. We must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. [Applause] Thank you. Joe Biden didn't just open our borders, he flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country.\n\nEntire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio buckled under the weight of the migrant, occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed. Now just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. [Applause] But there still is much work to be done.\n\nHere tonight is a woman I have gotten to know Alexis Nungaray from Houston, wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis' 12 year old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnaped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.\n\nThe death of this beautiful 12 year old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Joselyn is that she loved animals so much.\n\nShe loved nature. Across Galveston Bay from where Joselyn lived in Houston, you will find a magnificent National Wildlife Refuge. A pristine, peaceful 34,000 acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of The Gulf of America. Alexis, moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter Jocelyn.\n\nSo Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you. [Applause] Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang, the toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\n\n[Applause] They are now officially in the same category as ISIS. And that's not good for them. [Laughter] Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the US by the Biden administration. But now, every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or if they're too dangerous put in jails standing trial in this country.\n\nBecause we don't want them to come back ever. With us this evening, is a warrior on the front lines of that battle, Border Patrol Agent Roberto Ortiz, a great guy. [Applause] In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island, doesn't sound too nice to me, when heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them.\n\nRoberto saw that his partner was totally exposed, at great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety just -- and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and for your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed.\n\nWe honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. [Applause] Thank you, Roberto. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control.\n\nThey have total control over a whole nation posing a grave threat to our national security. The cartels are waging war on America and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels, which we are doing. [Applause] Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country.\n\nThat has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. [Applause] But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done. And they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the USA. They're going to stop it.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I have sent Congress a detailed funding request laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man, but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law.\n\nSo Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you. Mr. leader, thank you. Thank you very much and let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast you won't even believe it. [Applause] Thank you. And as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns.\n\n[Applause] In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics. Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous, repeat offenders, while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law starting at the FBI and the DOJ. Pam, good luck.\n\nKash, wherever you may be, good luck. Good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Is going to do a great job. Kash, thank you. Thank you, Kash. They have already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. We're also, once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they so dearly deserve.\n\nThey have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job, but we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it and they soon will respect it. This also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people and I will never forget them.\n\nAnd besides that, they voted for me in record numbers, so I have no choice. [Applause] One year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer, Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. The vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests, and they were rough arrests too.\n\nHe was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests and went by the name of killer. He was killer. He killed other people, they say a lot of them. I attended Officer Diller's service and when I met his wife and one-year old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow's name is Stephanie and she is here tonight.\n\nStephanie, thank you very much, Stephanie. Thank you very much. Stephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero, New York's finest, and we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets and we're going to do it fast. Got to stop it. They get out with 28 arrests.\n\nThey push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats. We got to get them out of here. I have already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer, and tonight I'm asking congress to pass that policy into permanent law.\n\n[Applause] I'm also asking for a new crime bill, getting tough on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers, so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed. Joining us in the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police.\n\nHis name is DJ Daniel. He is 13 years old and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. [Applause] But in 2018, DJ was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months at most to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, DJ and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true and DJ has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer, actually a number of times.\n\nThe police love him, the police departments love him. And tonight, DJ, we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service Director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States Secret Service. [Applause]\n\nCROWD: DJ, DJ, DJ.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Thank you, DJ. DJs doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to make America healthy again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. [Applause] With the name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering.\n\nHow quickly they forget. Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago, and you can't even believe these numbers, 1 in 10,000 children had autism, 1 in 10,000. And now it's 1 in 36. There's something wrong.\n\n1 in 36, think of that. So we're going to find out what it is and there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best, to figure out what is going on. OK, Bobby, good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Go get 'em.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Thank you. My administration is also working to protect our children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn, and her husband, discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13 year old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging her daughter to use a new name and pronouns.\n\nThey them pronouns, actually. All without telling January, who is here tonight, and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. [Applause] Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Stories like this are why shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology.\n\n[Applause] I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. [Applause] And now I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body.\n\nThis is a big lie. [Applause] And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you. [Applause] Because we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military. And it's already out. And it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad.\n\nIt's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don't we? Don't we feel better? [Applause] Our service members won't be activists and ideologues, they will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country. And Pete, Congratulations, Secretary of Defense. Congratulations. [Applause] And he's not big into the woke movement.\n\nI can tell you. I know him well. [Laughter] I am pleased to report that in January the US Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years. And that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference. [Applause] And you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite.\n\nWe couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country. And they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing.\n\nAnd thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. [Applause] We're joined tonight by a young man Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father grandfather and great grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy when he was just a boy.\n\nAnd now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six letter varsity athlete, a really good athlete, they say, a brilliant student with a 4.46, that's good, GPA. [Laughter] And his greatest dream is to attend the US Military Academy at West Point. [Applause] And Jason, that's a very big deal getting in. That's a hard one to get into.\n\nBut, I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted. [Applause] You will soon be joining the Corps of Cadets. [Applause] Thank you, Jason. You're going to be on the long gray line, Jason. As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state of the art Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland, all made in the USA. [Applause] And Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology just wasn't there, not even close.\n\nBut now we have the technology. It's incredible actually. And other places that they have it, Israel has it other places have it and the United States should have it too, right? Tim, right? They should have it too, so I want to thank you. But it's a very, very important -- this is a very dangerous world.\n\nWe should have it. We want to be protected. And we're going to protect our citizens like never before. To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. [Applause] And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new Office of Shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America where it belongs.\n\nWe used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact. To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal. And we've already started doing it. [Applause] Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.\n\nThe Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. [Applause] 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.\n\nThey paid them very highly to go there knowing there was a 25 percent chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history, if you bring it up to modern day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely.\n\nWe didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama. And we're taking it back. [Applause] And we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. [Laughter] [Applause] Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. [Laughter] No, Marco has been amazing and he's going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes.\n\n[Applause] You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman and I feel very certain, so let's assume he got 100 votes.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it. But he's already proven -- I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate your voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you. Thank you. He's doing a great job. [Applause] Great job. And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future.\n\nAnd if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America. We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security, and I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it. [Booing] We will keep you safe.\n\nWe will make you rich and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security. America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.\n\nThree and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing, it was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.\n\nTonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice. [Applause] And I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families, who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered and the many people that were so badly -- over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.\n\nWhat a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That's how bad it was. It should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people. I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. Just spoke to him on the phone.\n\nWe had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy, as happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter, was killed for no reason whatsoever. In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza.\n\nIn my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations, the Abraham Accords. [Applause] And now we're going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region. A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People have been talking about that so much lately with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, but a lot of things are happening in the Middle East.\n\nIt's a rough neighborhood actually. I'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight. The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense, with no security, with no anything.\n\n[Applause] Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah. Yeah. You would say -- Pocahontas says yes. [Booing] 2,000 people are being killed every single week, more than that. They're Russian young people. They're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans, but I want it to stop. Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine, by far.\n\nThink of that. They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending, and we've spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That's what happened. And they've spent $100 billion dollars. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us and they don't. But we're getting along very well with them and lots of good things are happening.\n\nBiden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent, by billions and billions of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let's equalize, you've got to be equal to us, but that didn't happen. Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.\n\nThe letter reads, Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians, he said. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence.\n\nRegarding the Agreement on Minerals and Security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you. I appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, we've had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.\n\nWouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful? [Applause] Wouldn't that be beautiful? It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end the senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides. Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years in a penal colony, rough stuff.\n\nThe previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin. But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that and they are here tonight. [Applause] To Mark and his great mom, we are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us. As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nHave you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally. That was not pleasant. [Laughter] And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son and I never did.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I never forgot, did I? I never forgot. Less than ten minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people. My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father and above all, a protector.\n\nWhen the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound, Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs.\n\nTwo others, very fine people, were also seriously hit. But thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors, we thought they were gone, and they were saved. So those doctors had great talent. We're joined by Corey's wife Helen, who was his high school sweetheart and their two beloved daughters, Allison, and Kaylee.\n\n[Applause] Thank you to Helen, Allison and Kaylee. Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot.\n\nIt was love like Corey's that built our country. And its love like Corey's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before. I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that. [Applause] Thank you. [Applause] Thank you.\n\n[Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. From the patriots of Lexington and Concord to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy from the warriors who crossed the Delaware to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk to the astronauts who touched the moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country and our freedom.\n\nAnd as we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today, a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free.\n\nAnd we will fight for it till death. We will never let anything happen to our beloved country. Because we are a country of doers, dreamers fighters and survivors. Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier.\n\nThey chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communist, fascist and Marxists all over the world.\n\nAnd gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age. These workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities. These warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\n\nNow it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty. And it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era. With God's help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher.\n\nAnd we are going to forge the freest most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this earth. We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science.\n\nAnd we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond. [Applause] And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American Spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American Dream. Every single day, we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country, our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve.\n\n[Applause] Thank you.\n\nCROWD: Fight, fight, fight. [Applause]\n\nDONALD TRUMP: My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future because the Golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you, very much.\n\n[Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, guys.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Trump dismisses concerns over back-and-forth levies, says 'tariffs could go up'\n\nLuke Garrett\n\nPresident Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 4, 2025. Ben Curtis/AP hide caption\n\nPresident Trump defended his administration's economic policy after he imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada last week and then rolled some of those levies back, causing what critics say is uncertainty for businesses and the broader economy.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News Channel's Sunday Morning Futures , Trump dismissed concerns over his back-and-forth tariffs and said they \"could go up.\"\n\nFox News' Maria Bartiromo asked Trump whether he expects a recession during his first year in office. The president couldn't say.\n\n\"I hate to predict things like that,\" Trump said. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing. And there are always periods of it takes a little time.\"\n\nThere are some signs that the economy may be headed toward a recession, but Howard Lutnick, the Commerce secretary, told NBC's Meet the Press there was \"no chance\" of one.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration said it would place a 25% tariff on cars and auto parts from Mexico and Canada. Soon after, the White House announced a one-month delay on the measure after carmakers Ford, Stellantis and General Motors called the president. During his interview with Bartiromo, Trump explained the move.\n\n\"This is short term and I felt for the good of the American carmakers,\" Trump said. \"I thought it would be a fair thing to do. And so I gave them a little bit of a break for this short period of time.\"\n\nCriticism from automakers notwithstanding, Sean Fain, the head of the United Auto Workers, called the tariffs an \"attempt to stop the bleeding\" in the American economy.\n\nTariffs \"aren't the end solution,\" he told ABC's This Week , \"but they are a huge factor in fixing this problem.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the stock market had it's worst week in 6 months with the S&P 500 dropping 3.1% and Nasdaq down 3.45%. Fox News' Bartiromo asked the president whether the uncertainty over tariffs - which many economist say is causing stocks to slump - will continue or if there will be clarity for businesses.\n\n\"Well I think so,\" Trump said. \"But you know the tariffs could go up as time goes by and they may go up.\"\n\nTrump also said he still plans to put  in place next month \"reciprocal\" tariffs against all trading partners that have tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\n\"April 2nd, it becomes all reciprocal,\" he said. \"What they charge us, we charge them.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "How a Push to Amend the Constitution Could Help Trump Expand Presidential Power\n\nThis article was produced for ProPublica's Local Reporting Network in partnership with Wisconsin Watch . Sign up for Dispatches to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.\n\nA behind-the-scenes legal effort to force Congress to call a convention to amend the Constitution could end up helping President Donald Trump in his push to expand presidential power.\n\nWhile the convention effort is focused on the national debt, legal experts say it could open the door to other changes, such as limiting who can be a U.S. citizen, allowing the president to overrule Congress' spending decisions or even making it legal for Trump to run for a third term.\n\nWisconsin Watch and ProPublica have obtained a draft version of a proposed lawsuit being floated to attorneys general in several states, revealing new details about who's involved and their efforts to advance legal arguments that liberal and conservative legal scholars alike have criticized, calling them \"wild,\" \"completely illegitimate\" and \"deeply flawed.\"\n\nThe endeavor predates Trump's second term but carries new weight as several members of Trump's inner circle and House Speaker Mike Johnson have previously expressed support for a convention to limit federal government spending and power.\n\nArticle V of the Constitution requires Congress to call a convention to propose and pass amendments if two-thirds of states, or 34, request one. This type of convention has never happened in U.S. history, and a decadeslong effort to advance a so-called balanced budget amendment, which would prohibit the government from running a deficit, has stalled at 28.\n\nDespite that, the lawsuit being circulated claims that Congress must hold a convention now because the states reached the two-thirds threshold in 1979. To get there, these activists count various calls for a convention dating back to the late 1700s. Wisconsin's petition, for example, was written in 1929 and was an effort to repeal Prohibition. The oldest petition they cite, from New York, predates the Bill of Rights. Some others came on the eve of the Civil War.\n\n\"It is absurd, on the face of it, that they could count something that had to do with Prohibition as a call for a constitutional convention in 2025,\" said Russ Feingold, a former Democratic senator from Wisconsin who co-wrote a book critical of convention efforts like this one . \"They're just playing games to try to pretend that the founders of this country wanted you to be able to mix and match resolutions from all different times in American history.\"\n\nTo avoid the threat of a convention, the legislatures in some states like Colorado and Illinois have passed resolutions withdrawing their petitions. The draft lawsuit says those actions don't count because \"once the Article V bell has been rung, it cannot be unrung.\" Nearly half the states the draft counts have rescinded their petitions.\n\nThe draft lawsuit is the work of the Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation, a low-profile nonprofit that has drawn support from balanced budget advocates and the conservative American Legislative Exchange Council. The group's chair, David M. Walker, oversaw government accountability as U.S. comptroller general during both the Clinton and Bush administrations. The draft lawsuit is signed by Charles \"Chuck\" Cooper, a high-powered conservative lawyer in Washington, D.C., who represented Trump's previous attorney general during the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nWalker and his team have shopped the lawsuit to over a dozen state attorneys general and Republican-controlled legislatures seeking to find states to serve as plaintiffs, according to emails obtained through records requests, public testimony and interviews. Alongside ALEC's CEO, they met with members of the Utah attorney general's office in 2023, trying to recruit the state to take the lead, and planned to meet with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, emails show. Lawmakers in Utah, Arizona, South Carolina and West Virginia have sought to get their states to join the lawsuit.\n\nWalker declined to confirm the authenticity of the draft complaint and wouldn't say which states have signed onto the lawsuit. But it mirrors the legal arguments Walker and his group have made, and the document's metadata shows Cooper's firm authored it. Neither Cooper nor his firm returned repeated requests for comment. An ALEC spokesperson said the group has merely provided a \"forum\" to \"exchange ideas.\"\n\nWalker said an attorney general's office has written its own version with \"modifications.\" He said he hopes the states will announce their intent to sue within the next two months and file shortly after.\n\nWalker and the draft complaint say the convention is necessary to confront the national debt and would be limited to discussing fiscal responsibility.\n\n\"Some people think that the convention would get together to basically rewrite the Constitution. That's totally false,\" Walker said. \"That has nothing to do with what we're proposing. Under Article V, it's just a separate way to get an amendment to the existing constitution.\"\n\nDozens of legal scholars and hundreds of civil society groups, organized by the government watchdog Common Cause, have warned that it would be exceedingly difficult to constrain a convention to just one idea and that calling one would expose the entire Constitution to revision. Some of them say the risk has grown under Trump.\n\n\"Nobody is observing any restraints on their power,\" Georgetown law professor and convention critic David Super said. \"If he continues to lose in the courts, one can imagine he will be trying to get a convention to adopt his view of presidential powers.\"\n\nAsked to respond, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly accused Wisconsin Watch of having \"TDS\" (Trump derangement syndrome) and being a \"dark money\" group. ( Wisconsin Watch makes its donors public here. )\n\nSam Fieldman, of the campaign finance reform group Wolf-PAC, has individually worked with the foundation on the lawsuit. He said the process empowers states to check the federal government and change the Constitution if Congress fails to act.\n\n\"People who are claiming that this process will lead to tyranny are sitting here twiddling their thumbs while we are heading toward tyranny like a rocket right now,\" Fieldman said.\n\nThroughout history, the Constitution has been amended 27 times, including to abolish slavery and provide women with the right to vote. An amendment must be approved by two-thirds of both houses of Congress. It then must be ratified by three-quarters of the states to become law.\n\nThe Constitution also offers another way: Congress can call a convention after two-thirds of state legislatures request one.\n\nBut Article V provides few other details. It does not say what constitutes a valid application or how to add them together to reach 34. Nor does it say how a convention should run. It does not enumerate specifics on delegates, such as who can serve and how states should select them, nor whether each state gets one vote or votes relative to population. And it does not specify whether a convention can be limited to specific issues.\n\nAs of now, the three-fourths ratification requirement still stands. Critics fear delegates could take the extreme step of lowering the threshold to make it easier for the amendments to pass, a scenario that proponents dismiss as \" fear mongering .\"\n\nFewer than half the states have laws or policies governing convention procedures. The majority of those would give state legislators, rather than voters, the ability to select delegates. They'd also permit each state one vote, according to a 2025 review by the Center for Media and Democracy, a progressive government watchdog.\n\nThe center obtained audio of former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania at a private ALEC workshop saying that because \"most states are going to be controlled by Republicans,\" rural and Republican voters will have \"an outsize granted power\" in a convention.\n\n\"We have the opportunity as a result of that to have a supermajority,\" he said, even though \"we may not even be in an absolute majority when it comes to the people who agree with us.\"\n\nSantorum did not return emails seeking comment.\n\nOver the years, people from across the political spectrum have attempted to call conventions for various topics, such as campaign finance reform and congressional term limits. None of the advocates have tried to use states' old calls that didn't specify a topic to reach the required 34.\n\nBut during a 2020 ALEC presentation , a balanced budget activist named David Biddulph debuted a new theory: By combining old resolutions that generally called for a convention with ones for a balanced budget amendment, the nation already surpassed the threshold.\n\nBiddulph said he based his theory on a paper authored by Robert Natelson , a former law professor who focuses on Article V, and published by the Federalist Society in 2018. But Natelson's paper did not claim the threshold had been reached, and in an interview, he said he disagrees with activists claiming otherwise.\n\nDuring the presentation, moderated by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Biddulph announced that his organization, which became the Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation, was encouraging attorneys general to file suit against Congress.\n\nBiddulph did not respond to repeated calls and emails seeking comment.\n\nThat same theory forms the basis of the draft lawsuit, which counts six petitions that called for a convention without stating a specific purpose alongside balanced budget ones to support their claim for a convention.\n\n\"They realize they will never get to 34 honestly now, so they are talking about a new math,\" said Nancy MacLean, a historian whose book \" Democracy in Chains \" discusses the dangers of a convention. Some convention opponents, like Super, refer to this as the \"fuzzy math\" theory.\n\nDuring a legislative hearing in Utah, Sharon Anderson, a conservative opponent of a convention, used a metaphor to criticize the counting method.\n\n\"A certain team, discouraged that they hadn't scored the winning touchdown yet, devised a way to win the game,\" Anderson said. \"Instead of actually getting the ball into the end zone, they would basically add up all the yards they had gained until they totaled a distance needed to cross the goal line.\"\n\nBut Natelson, a member of ALEC's board of scholars who is cited repeatedly in the lawsuit, said if lawmakers had wanted to limit their calls to specific topics, they could have done so.\n\nThe second key part of the foundation's legal argument is timing, which opponents like Super refer to as the \"time machine\" theory. Wisconsin passed a balanced budget amendment resolution in 2017, yet the draft instead includes the state's Prohibition-era petition because it's counting applications on the books between 1979 and 1998 - a period when the draft argues at least 34 existed.\n\nUnmentioned, however, is that almost nobody during that period claimed that the nation had surpassed the threshold.\n\nThis is unlike recent debates over the Equal Rights Amendment, which would prohibit discrimination based on sex. Some argue that enough states have now approved the amendment, but the U.S. archivist declined to certify it because Congress explicitly set a deadline for ratification that states did not meet.\n\nBiddulph and others began to enlist state support in 2022 with an email that announced: \"The historic milestone of 34 Article V state resolutions calling for an amendment convention to propose a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) has finally been achieved, and surprisingly it happened over 40 years ago.\"\n\nThe message, obtained by the Center for Media and Democracy and provided to Wisconsin Watch and ProPublica, asked states to pass a resolution demanding Congress call a convention and directing the state's legislature and attorney general to \"take such actions as will require Congress's compliance.\"\n\nRepublican state lawmakers in Utah and South Carolina responded within days, introducing measures incorporating some of the proposed language.\n\n\"We have a tremendous opportunity as a state to deal with an issue that is a very serious and grave moment in our nation,\" Utah state Rep. Ken Ivory, a Republican who introduced the measure, said at a legislative hearing in February 2022. \"It's the power of the state to be able to deal with the excessive debt and the financial explosion and the swindling, as Thomas Jefferson said, the swindling of the future on a massive scale.\"\n\nSince the Utah hearing, Arizona and West Virginia have also introduced measures demanding Congress call a convention. West Virginia's was the most explicit, resolving to \"commence federal court action\" against Congress, and advanced the furthest, passing the state House of Delegates before stalling in its Senate. So far, none of the resolutions has been adopted. West Virginia's was reintroduced last month.\n\nIn February 2024, activists believed they were close to filing the lawsuit, emails obtained through a public records request show. The Senate presidents and House speakers in Utah and Arizona signed letters expressing their interest in joining a federal lawsuit against Congress to force a convention on fiscal issues.\n\nIn an email that was cc'd to the Arizona lawmaker who sponsored the state's resolution, convention supporter Mike Kapic celebrated Utah's and Arizona's interest as a \"win.\"\n\n\"One more and UT says they'll lead the filing in federal court,\" Kapic wrote. \"Then watch other states rush to file.\"\n\nIt still hasn't happened. The Arizona Legislature does not have standing to file a lawsuit on its own, a spokesperson for the state attorney general said, and the Democratic attorney general has not agreed to take the case.\n\nA spokesperson for the Utah attorney general's office declined to comment on whether the state had agreed to file the suit.\n\nRead More\n\nIvory said by email that he is unaware whether Utah has any current plans to sue Congress. \"New AG, New Congress, New President,\" he wrote, adding that he believes \"negotiations\" may be taking place with Congress \"with potential promising results,\" but that he is not involved.\n\nAlaska is the only state listed on the draft complaint, but the state attorney general's office would not confirm whether it has joined.\n\nIn Congress, Texas Republican Rep. Jodey Arrington has also introduced resolutions to trigger a convention, including one he put forward last month. His office did not agree to an interview.\n\nIf Congress does call a convention, it would likely be up to delegates to keep it from creeping into other parts of the Constitution.\n\nHistorians generally agree that the 1787 constitutional convention itself was a runaway convention. Delegates met in Philadelphia to amend the Articles of Confederation, a process that required unanimity among states. Instead, they scrapped the entire document and drafted the Constitution, proposing a lower threshold for states to ratify amendments.\n\nMollie Simon contributed research.\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "\"Put Them in Trauma\": Inside a Key MAGA Leader's Plans for a New Trump Agenda\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWe are still reporting. Do you have any information about the Office of Management and Budget or Russell Vought? You can reach Andy Kroll on Signal at 202-215-6203.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nA key ally to former President Donald Trump detailed plans to deploy the military in response to domestic unrest, defund the Environmental Protection Agency and put career civil servants \"in trauma\" in a series of previously unreported speeches that provide a sweeping vision for a second Trump term.\n\nIn private speeches delivered in 2023 and 2024, Russell Vought, who served as Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget, described his work crafting legal justifications so that military leaders or government lawyers would not stop Trump's executive actions.\n\nHe said the plans are a response to a \"Marxist takeover\" of the country; likened the moment to 1776 and 1860, when the country was at war or on the brink of it; and said the timing of Trump's candidacy was a \"gift of God.\"\n\n\"Their Entire Apparatus Is Exposed to Our Strategy\"\n\nProPublica and Documented obtained videos of the two speeches Vought delivered during events for the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank led by Vought. The think tank's employees or fellows include Jeffrey Clark, the former senior Justice Department lawyer who aided Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election result; Ken Cuccinelli, a former acting deputy secretary in the Department of Homeland Security under Trump; and Mark Paoletta, a former senior budget official in the Trump administration. Other Trump allies such as former White House adviser Steve Bannon and U.S. Reps. Chip Roy and Scott Perry either spoke at the conferences or appeared on promotional materials for the events.\n\nVought does not hide his agenda or shy away from using extreme rhetoric in public. But the apocalyptic tone and hard-line policy prescriptions in the two private speeches go further than his earlier pronouncements. As OMB director, Vought sought to use Trump's 2020 \"Schedule F\" executive order to strip away job protections for nonpartisan government workers. But he has never spoken in such pointed terms about demoralizing federal workers to the point that they don't want to do their jobs. He has spoken in broad terms about undercutting independent agencies but never spelled out sweeping plans to defund the EPA and other federal agencies.\n\nVought's plans track closely with Trump's campaign rhetoric about using the military against domestic protesters or what Trump has called the \"enemy within.\" Trump's desire to use the military on U.S. soil recently prompted his longest-serving chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, to speak out , saying Trump \"certainly prefers the dictator approach to government.\"\n\nOther policies mentioned by Vought dovetail with Trump's plans, such as embracing a wartime footing on the southern border and rolling back transgender rights. Agenda 47, the campaign's policy blueprint, calls for revoking President Joe Biden's order expanding gender-affirming care for transgender people; Vought uses even more extreme language, decrying the \"transgender sewage that's being pumped into our schools and institutions\" and referring to gender-affirming care as \"chemical castration.\"\n\nSince leaving government, Vought has reportedly remained a close ally of the former president. Speaking in July to undercover journalists posing as relatives of a potential donor, Vought said Trump had \"blessed\" the Center for Renewing America and was \"very supportive of what we do,\" CNN reported .\n\nVought did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"Since the Fall of 2023, President Trump's campaign made it clear that only President Trump and the campaign, and NOT any other organization or former staff, represent policies for the second term,\" Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement. She did not directly address Vought's statements.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, his campaign's national press secretary, added there have been no discussions on who would serve in a second Trump administration.\n\nIn addition to running his think tank, Vought was the policy director of the Republican National Committee's official platform committee ahead of the nominating convention. He's also an architect of Project 2025, the controversial coalition effort mapping out how a second Trump administration can quickly eliminate obstacles to rolling out a hard-right policy agenda.\n\nAs ProPublica and Documented reported, Project 2025 has launched a massive program to recruit, vet and train thousands of people to \"be ready on day one\" to serve in a future conservative administration. (Trump has repeatedly criticized Project 2025, and his top aides have said the effort has no connection to the official campaign despite the dozens of former Trump aides and advisers who contributed to Project 2025.)\n\nVought is widely expected to take a high-level government role if Trump wins a second term. His name has even been mentioned as a potential White House chief of staff . The videos obtained by ProPublica and Documented offer an unfiltered look at Vought's worldview, his plans for a Trump administration and his fusing of MAGA ideology and Christian nationalism .\n\nIn his 2024 speech, Vought said he was spending the majority of his time helping lead Project 2025 and drafting an agenda for a future Trump presidency. \"We have detailed agency plans,\" he said. \"We are writing the actual executive orders. We are writing the actual regulations now, and we are sorting out the legal authorities for all of what President Trump is running on.\"\n\nVought laid out how his think tank is crafting the legal rationale for invoking the Insurrection Act, a law that gives the president broad power to use the military for domestic law enforcement. The Washington Post previously reported the issue was at the top of the Center for Renewing America's priorities.\n\n\"We want to be able to shut down the riots and not have the legal community or the defense community come in and say, 'That's an inappropriate use of what you're trying to do,'\" he said. Vought held up the summer 2020 unrest following George Floyd's murder as an example of when Trump ought to have had the ability to deploy the armed forces but was stymied .\n\nVought's preparations for a future Trump administration involve building a \"shadow\" Office of Legal Counsel, he told the gathered supporters in May 2023. That office, part of the Justice Department, advises the president on the scope of their powers. Vought made clear he wants the office to help Trump steamroll the kind of internal opposition he faced in his first term.\n\n\"We're Trying to Build a Shadow Office of Legal Counsel\"\n\nHistorically, the OLC has operated with a degree of independence. \"If, all of a sudden, the office is full of a bunch of loyalists whose only job is to rubber-stamp the White House's latest policy directive, whose only goal is to justify the ends by whatever means, that would be quite dangerous,\" said an attorney who worked in the office under a previous Republican administration and requested anonymity to speak freely.\n\nAnother priority, according to Vought, was to \"defund\" certain independent federal agencies and demonize career civil servants, which include scientists and subject matter experts. Project 2025's plan to revive Schedule F, an attempt to make it easier to fire a large swath of government workers who currently have civil service protections, aligns with Vought's vision.\n\n\"We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\" he said. \"When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so.\n\n\"We want to put them in trauma.\"\n\n\"We Want the Bureaucrats to Be Traumatically Affected\"\n\nVought also revealed the extent of the Center for Renewing America's role in whipping up right-wing panic ahead of the 2022 midterms over an increase in asylum-seekers crossing at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn February 2022, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich released a legal opinion claiming the state was under \"invasion\" by violent cartels and could invoke war powers to deploy National Guard troops to its southern border. The legally dubious \"invasion\" theory became a potent Republican talking point.\n\nVought said in the 2023 speech that he and Cuccinelli, the former top Homeland Security official for Trump, personally lobbied Brnovich on the effort. \"We said, 'Look, you can write your own opinion, but here's a draft opinion of what this should look like,'\" Vought said.\n\nThe nonpartisan watchdog group American Oversight later obtained an email in which Vought pitched the \"invasion\" framework to Brnovich.\n\nBrnovich wrote in an email to ProPublica that he recalled multiple discussions with Cuccinelli about border security. But he added that \"the invasion opinion was the result of a formal request from a member of the Arizona legislature. And I can assure you it was drafted and written by hard working attorneys (including myself) in our office.\"\n\nIn the event Trump loses, Vought called for Republican leaders of states such as Florida and Texas to \"create red-state sanctuaries\" by \"kicking out all the feds as much as they possibly can.\"\n\nThe two speeches delivered by Vought, taken together, offer an unvarnished look at the animating ideology and political worldview of a key figure in the MAGA movement.\n\nOver the last century, Vought said, the U.S. has \"experienced nothing short of a quiet revolution\" and abandoned what he saw as the true meaning and force of the Constitution. The country today, he argued, was a \"post-constitutional regime,\" one that no longer adhered to the separation of powers among the three branches of government as laid out by the framers.\n\nHe lamented that the conservative right and the nation writ large had become \"too secular\" and \"too globalist.\" He urged his allies to join his mission to \"renew a consensus of America as a nation under God.\"\n\nAnd in one of his most dramatic flourishes, he likened the 2024 election to moments in America's history when the country was facing all-out war.\n\n\"We are here in the year of 2024, a year that very well [could] - and I believe it will - rival 1776 and 1860 for the complexity and the uncertainty of the forces arrayed against us,\" Vought told his audience, referring to years when the colonies declared independence from Britain and the first state seceded over President Abraham Lincoln's election. \"God put us here for such a time as this.\"\n\nVought said that independent agencies and unelected bureaucrats and experts wield far too much power while the traditional legislative process is a sham. He extended that critique to agencies like the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve, whose independence from the White House had long been protected by both political parties.\n\n\"The left in the U.S. doesn't want an energetic president with the power to motivate the executive branch to the will of the American people consistent with the laws of the country,\" he said in the 2024 speech. \"They don't want a vibrant Congress where great questions are debated and decided in front of the American people. They don't want empowered members. They want discouraged and bored backbenchers.\"\n\nHe added, \"The all-empowered career expert like Tony Fauci is their model, wielding power behind the curtains.\" Fauci was one of the top public health experts under Trump at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and a key figure in coordinating the national response.\n\nWhat sets Vought apart from most of his fellow conservative activists is that he accuses powerful organizations on the right of being complicit in the current system of government, singling out the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, the conservative and libertarian legal network co-chaired by activist Leonard Leo. The society is widely seen as an instrumental force in cultivating young conservative lawyers and building a bench of future judges whose embrace of legal theories like originalism and textualism have led to decisions overturning abortion rights, environmental protections and social welfare policies.\n\nYet in his 2024 speech, Vought accused the Federalist Society and \"originalist judges\" of being a part of the problem, perpetuating the \"post-constitutional structure\" that Vought lamented by not ruling more aggressively to weaken or dismantle independent regulatory agencies that Vought and his allies view as illegitimate or unconstitutional.\n\nIt was \"like being in a contract quietly revoked two decades ago, in which one party didn't tell the other,\" he said. \"At some point, reality needs to set in. Instead, we have the vaunted so-called Federalist Society and originalist judges acting as a Praetorian Guard for this post-constitutional structure.\"\n\nEchoing Trump's rhetoric, Vought implicitly endorsed the false claim of a stolen 2020 election and likened the media's debunkings of that claim to Chinese Communist propaganda.\n\n\"In the aftermath of the election, we had all these people going around saying, 'Well, I don't see any evidence of voter fraud. The media's not giving enough [of] a compelling case,'\" he said. \"Well, that compelling case has emerged. But does a Christian in China ask and come away saying, 'You know, there's no persecution, because I haven't read about it in the state regime press?' No, they don't.\"\n\n\"A Compelling Case\"\n\nVought referred to the people detained for alleged crimes committed on Jan. 6, 2021, as \"political prisoners\" and defended the lawyers Jeffrey Clark and John Eastman, who have both faced criminal charges for their role in Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Federal law enforcement agencies, he added, \"are keeping political opponents in jail, and I think we need to be honest about that.\"\n\nThe left, Vought continued, has the ultimate goal of ending representative democracy altogether. \"The stark reality in America is that we are in the late stages of a complete Marxist takeover of the country,\" he said, \"in which our adversaries already hold the weapons of the government apparatus, and they have aimed it at us. And they are going to continue to aim it until they no longer have to win elections.\"\n\nWhen Democrats called Trump an \"existential threat to democracy,\" they were not merely calling for his defeat at the ballot box, he said, but were using \"coded language the national security state uses overseas when they are overthrowing other governments\" to discourage the military from putting down anti-Trump protests should he win.\n\n\"They're making Trump out to be a would-be dictator or an authoritarian,\" he said. \"So they're actively working now to ensure, on a number of levels, that the military will perceive this as dictatorial and therefore not respond to any orders to quell any violence.\"\n\nRead More\n\nTrump, Vought insisted, has the credibility and the track record to defeat the \"Marxist\" left and bring about the changes that Vought and his MAGA allies seek. In his view, the Democratic Party's agenda and its \"quiet revolution\" could be stopped only by a \"radical constitutionalist,\" someone in the mold of Thomas Jefferson or James Madison. For Vought, no one was in a better position to fill that role than Trump.\n\n\"We have in Donald Trump a man who is so uniquely positioned to serve this role, a man whose own interests perfectly align with the interests of the country,\" Vought said. \"He has seen what it has done to him, and he has seen what they are trying to do to the country.\n\n\"That,\" he added, \"is nothing more than a gift of God.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nMolly Redden is a ProPublica reporter covering politics.\n\nI cover justice and the rule of law, including the Justice Department, U.S. attorneys and the courts.\n\nSend me tips and documents about changes in administration policy, political interference, conflicts of interest and abuses of power inside the DOJ, OMB, the White House and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Trump Halted an Agent Orange Cleanup. That Puts Hundreds of Thousands at Risk for Poisoning.\n\nRead this story in Vietnamese. Xem bài viết này bằng tiếng Việt.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nIn mid-February, Trump administration leaders received a desperate warning from their diplomats posted in Vietnam, one of the most important American partners in Asia.\n\nWorkers were in the middle of cleaning up the site of an enormous chemical spill, the Bien Hoa air base, when Secretary of State Marco Rubio abruptly halted all foreign aid funding. The shutdown left exposed open pits of soil contaminated with dioxin, the deadly byproduct of Agent Orange, which the American military sprayed across large swaths of the country during the Vietnam War. After Rubio's orders to stop work, the cleanup crews were forced to abandon the site, and, for weeks, all that was covering the contaminated dirt were tarps, which at one point blew off in the wind.\n\nAnd even more pressing, the officials warned in a Feb. 14 letter obtained by ProPublica, Vietnam is on the verge of its rainy season, when torrential downpours are common. With enough rain, they said, soil contaminated with dioxin could flood into nearby communities, poisoning their food supplies.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people live around the Bien Hoa air base, and some of their homes abut the site's perimeter fence, just yards from the contaminated areas. And less than 1,500 feet away is a major river that flows into Ho Chi Minh City, population 9 million.\n\n\"Simply put,\" the officials added, \"we are quickly heading toward an environmental and life-threatening catastrophe.\"\n\nThey received no response from Washington, according to three people familiar with the situation.\n\nInstead, Rubio and Peter Marocco, another top Trump appointee, have not only ordered the work to stop, but they also have frozen more than $1 million in payments for work already completed by the contractors the U.S. hired. The company overseeing the project is Tetra Tech, a publicly traded consulting and engineering firm based in the U.S., and a Vietnamese construction firm has been tasked with the excavation work.\n\nThen, on Feb. 26, Rubio and Marocco canceled both companies' contracts altogether before apparently reversing that decision about a week later, agency records show. As of Thursday, the companies had not been paid.\n\nThe Trump administration has told the courts repeatedly that its process to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which manages the project's funds, has been careful and considered. But the botched situation at Bien Hoa is a stark example of the whiplash, conflicting messages and dire consequences that aid organizations worldwide have faced since early February.\n\nNow, after losing several weeks because of the administration's orders, the companies are scrambling - at their own expense - to secure the Bien Hoa site before it starts raining, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica and several people familiar with the current situation.\n\nThe USAID officials who would typically travel to the air base to provide oversight have been placed on administrative leave or prevented from traveling to check on the work. They've also been forbidden from communicating with the Vietnamese government or the companies working at the base, sources say, though they believe that directive was lifted after the contracts were recently reinstated. The confusion has left many at both the embassy and in Washington in the dark about where the situation stands.\n\nTo ascertain the current status of the work, ProPublica hired a reporter to visit the air base on Friday.\n\nWorkers are laboring in 95 degree heat, surrounded by toxic soil. The site has a skeleton crew of less than half of what they previously had, according to workers and documents reviewed by ProPublica. Some staffers found new jobs during the suspension. People working at the site told the reporter they are worried about completing the work before the rainy season descends and are terrified the U.S. will pause the work again.\n\nSince 2019, the U.S. government has collaborated with Vietnam's Ministry of Defense to clean up the Bien Hoa air base and agreed to spend more than $430 million for the project. Unlike other foreign aid programs, addressing Agent Orange is more akin to restitution than charity because the U.S. brought the deadly substance there in the first place. \"The dioxin remediation program is one of the core reasons why we have an extraordinary relationship with Vietnam today,\" a State Department official told ProPublica, \"a country that should by all rights hate us.\"\n\nWith enough contaminated soil to fill about 40,000 dump trucks, the Bien Hoa air base is the largest deposit of postwar pesticides remaining in Vietnam after a decadeslong cleanup campaign. Human rights groups, environmentalists and diplomats consider the cleanup work - along with disability assistance that the U.S. has provided to Agent Orange victims across the country - to be one of the most successful foreign aid initiatives of all time.\n\nAll of that was now in peril, the officials wrote in their Feb. 14 letter to USAID officials in Washington. \"What immediate actions can be taken to avert a potential life-threatening incident while still maintaining compliance with the Executive Order and the suspension directives?\" the officials wrote.\n\nU.S. officials in Vietnam grew increasingly panicked. The ambassador sent a diplomatic cable to Washington, and Congress and USAID's inspector general each received a whistleblower complaint, multiple people told ProPublica.\n\n\"Halting a project like that in the middle of the work, that's an environmental crime,\" said Jan Haemers, CEO of another organization that previously worked in Vietnam to clean up Agent Orange in the soil. \"If you stop in the middle, it's worse than if you never started.\"\n\nThe State Department said in a statement that the contracts at Bien Hoa are \"active and running\" but did not respond to detailed follow-up questions. Tetra Tech and the Vietnamese construction firm did not respond to questions for this story. The Vietnamese Embassy and Ministry of Defense did not return requests for comment. But the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement on Feb. 13 that it was \" deeply concerned \" about USAID program suspensions, specifically mentioning the Bien Hoa project.\n\nTrump's aides, including billionaire Elon Musk, began dismantling the U.S. foreign assistance system almost immediately after the inauguration. They dismissed USAID staff en masse, issued sweeping stop-work orders, froze funds and eventually canceled most of the agency's contracts with aid organizations around the world, leaving countless children, refugees and other desperately vulnerable people without critical services .\n\nOn Monday, Rubio boasted on X that they had cut 83% of USAID's programs because they didn't align with Trump's agenda.\n\nAfter terminating the contracts, Rubio, Musk and Marocco reversed several of their decisions in Vietnam, designating the Bien Hoa project as one of the few programs to survive, at least for now.\n\nEvery president since George W. Bush - including Trump - has made good on the American promise to repair relations with Vietnam by cleaning up Agent Orange and helping those sick or disabled from dioxin poisoning. In 2017, Trump landed at Danang Airport, a prior cleanup site, ahead of a free-trade meeting with Asia-Pacific countries. The U.S. now conducts $160 billion in annual commerce with Vietnam, which has also become a key partner against China's growing influence in the South China Sea. The Pentagon and Vietnamese military now work together as well , including efforts to locate the remains of soldiers missing in action from the war 50 years ago.\n\n\"All of this is underpinned by the cooperation on Agent Orange,\" said Charles Bailey, a former Ford Foundation representative in Vietnam who co-wrote a book on the country's relations with the U.S. in the wake of the war. \"It's like pulling out one or two legs of the stool.\"\n\nThe Bien Hoa project was formally launched and initial contracts signed during Trump's first presidency. In another example of the administration's confusing stance toward the project, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told his Vietnamese counterpart on a Feb. 7 phone call that Trump wanted to enhance defense ties by addressing war legacy issues, which include Agent Orange remediation. About half of the project's funding comes from the Pentagon's budget, though it's funneled through USAID, so it was also caught up in the foreign aid freeze.\n\nEnvironmental consultants, foreign policy experts and government officials said the episode in Bien Hoa shows the administration did not do a thoughtful audit. \"One might imagine a less reckless government looking at what we're doing carefully and then deciding what's in our interest,\" David Shear, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam under Barack Obama, told ProPublica.\n\n\"But,\" he said, \"this is government reform by meat cleaver.\"\n\nThe mixture known as Agent Orange is a combination of two herbicides that the U.S. brought to Vietnam in huge volumes to kill off jungles and mangroves that hid opposition forces during the Vietnam war. The mixture contained dioxin, a deadly substance that not only causes a range of cancers and other illnesses, but is also linked to birth defects for babies exposed in utero. During the war, the U.S. sprayed more than 10 million gallons of the herbicides across vast swaths of the country, exposing U.S. soldiers as well as millions of Vietnamese people and their future children to the deadly toxic substance.\n\nStorage sites like the air bases of Danang and Bien Hoa were heavily contaminated as barrels leaked, broke or were otherwise mishandled. Over the decades, dust has blown the contaminated soil off the bases and abundant rains have pushed the dioxin into waterways and the densely packed surrounding neighborhoods, contaminating fish as well as ducks and chicken that people raise for food. Soil samples at the Bien Hoa base have shown dioxin at levels as high as 800 times the allowed amount in Vietnam.\n\nFor decades since the war, and despite extensive documentation of higher rates of cancers and birth defects among people who had been exposed to the chemicals, the U.S. denied the mass toll Agent Orange had taken on Vietnamese people - as well as on American veterans, as ProPublica has previously reported . But starting in the mid-2000s under President George W. Bush, the U.S. began earmarking federal dollars for dioxin remediation in Vietnam to clean up the contamination sites and the two nations' troubled relationship.\n\nThe cleanup work is dangerous and laborious. People hired by the contractors wear extensive protective equipment in the sweltering humidity and must have their blood tested regularly for dioxin. When levels get too high, they are no longer allowed to work at the site. There are supposed to be extensive safety checks in place to ensure the dirt doesn't poison military officials or the surrounding community.\n\nThe plan at Bien Hoa is to excavate a half-million cubic meters of the most contaminated soil and enclose it underground or cook it in an enormous furnace, which hasn't been built yet, until the dioxin no longer poses a threat. The work requires extensive pumping and management of dioxin-contaminated water. Contractors are halfway through a 10-year project set to happen in stages, and the bulk of the excavation work must be done between December and April when there is less rain.\n\nRead More\n\nAfter Rubio first issued sweeping stop-work orders to aid organizations and contractors around the world in late January, workers from the site were told to stay home for weeks. The companies stopped receiving money to cover payroll and their past invoices. Huge mounds of tarp-covered dirt dotted sections of the base.\n\nUSAID and State Department staff scrambled to get the project back online through the State Department's confusing waiver process and appealed to counterparts in the U.S. A group of Democratic senators sent a letter to Hegseth and Rubio urging them to pay the contractors. \"It would be difficult to overstate the damage to the relationship that would result if the U.S were to walk away from these war legacy programs,\" they wrote. They got no response.\n\nOne of the senators who signed the letter, Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told ProPublica that abandoning the Bien Hoa cleanup is \"a betrayal of the goodwill our two nations built over 30 years\" and a \"gift to our adversaries.\"\n\nEven off-season rains pushed the sites to the brink, two sources said, with water pooling up to the edge of protective aprons, threatening to spill out onto an active military runway after recent rainstorms.\n\nHeavier rains typically start in April before the downpours of the rainy season in May.\n\nThe contractors are desperately trying to secure the contaminated dirt and pits before then, according to interviews this week with several people working there. But they are two months behind schedule.\n\n\"The problem is that the Trump administration has destroyed USAID, so it's very unclear how we're going to complete this project,\" said Tim Rieser, a longtime aide to former Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who led a bipartisan delegation to break ground in Bien Hoa in 2019. \"The people making the decisions probably know the least.\"\n\nAlex Mierjeski contributed research.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI report on global public health and the agencies that govern it, including the NIH, IHS, USAID and CDC.\n\nI welcome tips from people with knowledge of public health at the local, state, federal and international level, including scientists, government officials and advocates, and anyone who knows about issues that affect the public's health.\n\nI'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter on ProPublica's national desk, where I write about the government, companies and power.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "The October Story That Outlined Exactly What the Trump Administration Would Do to the Federal Bureaucracy\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. This story was originally published in our Dispatches newsletter; sign up to receive notes from our journalists.\n\nIn late October, ProPublica published one of its most prophetic stories in our history. You can be forgiven if you missed it at the time. There was a lot going on in the days before the election, and the headlines were dominated by seemingly consequential issues like the racist humor of a comedian who addressed Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut if you weren't among the several hundred thousand people who read our story, \"' Put Them in Trauma': Inside a Key MAGA Leader's Plans for a New Trump Agenda ,\" in real time, you may have seen it referenced since Trump took office in January.\n\nThe story drew on private recordings of a series of speeches given in 2023 and 2024 by Russell Vought obtained by our colleagues at Documented , a news site with a remarkable knack for uncovering information powerful interests would prefer remained secret.\n\nVought, a self-described Christian nationalist who served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget in Trump's first term, was known for his provocative public pronouncements. But he went even further in private, envisaging a Trump presidency in which regulatory agencies would be shut down and career civil servants would be too depressed to get out of bed.\n\n\"We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\" Vought said in one recording . \"When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so.\n\n\"We want to put them in trauma.\"\n\nVought spoke openly about the ongoing planning to defund independent federal agencies and demonize government scientists. \"We have detailed agency plans,\" he said. \"We are writing the actual executive orders. We are writing the actual regulations now, and we are sorting out the legal authorities for all of what President Trump is running on.\"\n\nVought argued that the radical steps were necessary because Trump's opponents were themselves attempting to end democracy. \"The stark reality in America is that we are in the late stages of a complete Marxist takeover of the country,\" he said in one speech. \"Our adversaries already hold the weapons of the government apparatus, and they have aimed it at us. And they are going to continue to aim it until they no longer have to win elections.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine a more prescient piece of journalism. The story captured, as few did, the breadth and ferocity of the coming attack on the federal government. Vought has returned to his post as the budget office's director, and his plans for eviscerating entire agencies and decimating the morale of federal workers have turned into reality. Trump 47 looks very different from Trump 45, just as Vought told his audiences that it would.\n\nSo why didn't this story drive more of a national conversation when it appeared?\n\nAs a news organization that tries to spur change by bringing new facts to light, we think about this question a lot. Our job at ProPublica is to both get the story and get it into the heads of a critical mass of citizens and elected officials.\n\nI've been an investigative reporter and editor for nearly three decades, and I still struggle to predict which of our stories will catalyze national conversations. Our 2018 story about the recording of a young girl in a immigration detention center prompted the Trump administration to end its policy of family separation at the border. Many other powerful stories fail to break through.\n\nPart of the problem, of course, is the proliferation of media. Every day, dozens of important-sounding stories vie for readers' attention along with the flood of posts on social media and texts from friends and colleagues. And that's not to mention all the podcasts and multipart dramas on Netflix and HBO.\n\nThis was an issue long before Trump and his allies adopted a \"flood the zone\" strategy with multiple norm-challenging actions, but it seems even more acute right now.\n\nIt is often said of journalists that we write the rough draft of history. But our work differs from historians in a crucial aspect: Scholars typically are chronicling events after the outcome is clear. As journalists, we face a tougher challenge as we try to find the stories in the cacophony of daily events that tell us something about where we're going.\n\nA lot of what we do as reporters is akin to squinting through opaque windows at events unfolding in a very dimly lit room. We can see who is inside and how they're moving, but our lack of context often prevents us from understanding what's really happening. We default to assuming that the future will be roughly like the past, guessing that, say, Trump 47 will be roughly like Trump 45 with fewer guardrails.\n\nVought could not have been clearer that this was not the case, and he had the credentials that should have made what he was saying entirely credible. After all, Vought was the author of the plan in Trump's first term to make it easier to fire large numbers of civil servants. He was a key member of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation project that described in copious detail how a second Trump administration might unfold.\n\nStill, there was at least one data point that perhaps prevented readers from viewing his speeches as predictive as they turned out to be. As our story made clear, Vought despises the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, a core Republican ally in bringing conservative voices into the judiciary and federal law enforcement. We quoted him as asserting that \"the vaunted so-called Federalist Society and originalist judges\" were serving as a \"Praetorian Guard\" for the Democrats.\n\nThat view would seem to make him something of a fringe thinker in MAGA world, which relied on the Federalist Society to pick the judges who make up the conservative supermajority on the high court.\n\nThings look different today. Seen against the backdrop of recent events, Vought's disdain for the rule-of-law scruples of Federalist Society legal thinkers seems entirely in line with Trump's recent post suggesting a federal judge shouldn't have authority over his administration.\n\nRead More\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Danielle Sassoon, one of the Federalist Society's bright lights, a Yale Law graduate who had clerked for conservative icon Antonin Scalia, resigned as acting U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York rather than carry out orders from the Trump Justice Department. In refusing to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, Sassoon wrote that she understood her duty as a prosecutor to mean \"enforcing the law impartially, and that includes prosecuting a validly returned indictment regardless of whether its dismissal would be politically advantageous, to the defendant or those that appointed me.\"\n\nMany years ago, a New York Times investigative reporter and I were discussing a story we had worked on that had been sharply and justifiably criticized as new facts emerged. \"I can be fair and accurate,\" he said. \"But fair, accurate and prescient is beyond me.\"\n\nIt seems appropriate to give Vought the last word since the worldview he described has proven so accurate. What sounded grandiose in the preelection days seems today like a reasonable summary of the path Trump and his allies have chosen.\n\n\"We are here in the year of 2024, a year that very well [could] - and I believe it will - rival 1776 and 1860 for the complexity and the uncertainty of the forces arrayed against us,\" Vought said, citing the years when the colonies declared independence from Britain and the first state seceded over President Abraham Lincoln's election.\n\n\"God put us here for such a time as this.\"\n\nI'm not sure about the role of the almighty in ProPublica's work in the coming years. But we feel equally strongly that we're here for a \"time such as this.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nStephen Engelberg is ProPublica's editor in chief and served as founding managing editor from 2008-2012.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Emails Reveal Top IRS Lawyer Warned Trump Firings Were a \"Fraud\" on the Courts\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nOn Feb. 20, nearly 7,000 probationary employees at the Internal Revenue Service began receiving an unsigned letter telling them that they had been fired for poor performance.\n\nTrump administration lawyers insist that the IRS and other federal agencies have acted within their authority when they ordered waves of mass terminations since Trump took office. But according to previously unreported emails obtained by ProPublica, a top lawyer at the IRS warned administration officials that the performance-related language in his agency's termination letter was \"a false statement\" that amounted to \"fraud\" if the agency kept the language in the letter.\n\nThe emails reveal that in the hours before the IRS sent out its Feb. 20 termination letter, a fierce dispute played out at the agency's highest levels.\n\nJoseph Rillotta, a senior IRS lawyer, wrote that \"no one\" at the IRS had taken into account the performance of the probationary workers set to be fired. Rillotta urged that the language be struck from the draft termination letter.\n\nIf the falsehood wasn't removed, Rillotta said he would file a report with the inspector general for the IRS.\n\nNo one appeared to respond to Rillotta's first email. In a follow-up email, he said he was \"pleading with you to remove the clause,\" adding: \"It is not an immaterial false statement, because it is designed to improve the government's posture in litigation (to the detriment of the employees that we are terminating today).\"\n\nBecause it was not true, he wrote, \"That renders it, as I see it, an anticipatory fraud on tribunals of jurisdiction over these employment actions.\"\n\nRillotta was again ignored. The IRS sent out the Feb. 20 termination notice with the disputed language in it, according to copies received by fired workers who shared them with ProPublica. The notice said the decision to fire the workers had taken \"into account your performance\" as well as administration guidance and \"current mission needs.\"\n\nIn fact, many of the employees had received laudatory reviews with no hint of any concerns.\n\nSoon afterward, the inspector general for the IRS took preliminary steps to look into the matter, according to a person familiar with the effort who wasn't authorized to speak with reporters. This person said they told the investigator that they agreed with Rillotta that the performance rationale was false.\n\nMichelle Bercovici, a lawyer who represents federal workers, told ProPublica that Rillotta's ignored warnings should make it easier for plaintiffs to show that the mass firings were \"arbitrary and capricious,\" the legal standard needed to invalidate a federal agency's action. She added that the emails could also help plaintiffs recover attorneys' fees from the government.\n\n\"When an agency acts based on false information, not only does it set the action up for being overturned,\" she said. \"It also means the agency is not going to have many defenses to its actions and could be liable for fees.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the Treasury Department and IRS did not respond to requests for comment. An Office of Personnel Management spokesperson referred ProPublica to a revised memorandum stating that OPM \"is not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees.\"\n\nThe terminations at the tax agency were among the deep cuts to federal agencies by the Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency, led by the billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk.\n\nMultiple federal lawsuits are now challenging the Trump administration's mass firings. Last week, two federal judges temporarily blocked the IRS and other firings, but the lawsuits continue.\n\nThe issue of whether the performance rationale was legitimate has been central to the suits. One suit , brought by a group of labor unions, advocacy groups and other parties in California federal court, alleges that OPM directed the probationary firings and so \"perpetrated one of the most massive employment frauds in the history of this country, telling tens of thousands of workers that they are being fired for performance reasons, when they most certainly were not.\"\n\nIn response, administration lawyers denied that OPM directed agencies to fire probationary workers based on performance or misconduct. Instead, the filing says, \"OPM reminded agencies of the importance of the probationary period in evaluating applicants' continued employment and directed agencies to identify all employees on probationary periods and promptly determine whether those employees should be retained at the agency.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs later expanded that suit to include the Treasury Department, which oversees the IRS, as one of the defendants. In mid-March, Judge William Alsup issued a preliminary injunction in the case, saying the administration's probationary firings were based on \"a lie.\" Alsup ordered several federal agencies, including the Treasury, to reinstate thousands of fired employees. The Trump administration has appealed Alsup's ruling.\n\nAnother suit , filed in Maryland federal court by nearly two dozen Democratic state attorneys general, also claims that the IRS mass firings were unlawful and should be reversed. (In that case, administration lawyers asserted that the mass firings were lawful.)\n\nCourt filings in both cases have partially revealed how the administration chose to make the legally questionable decision to fire probationary workers en masse on performance grounds..\n\nAt the IRS, the plan to fire probationary employees began in early February, according to an affidavit filed in the Maryland case.\n\nA high-ranking Treasury Department official instructed a senior IRS personnel employee named Traci DiMartini to identify all probationary IRS employees and fire them \"based on performance,\" according to an affidavit DiMartini later filed in court.\n\nDiMartini had \"never heard of mass probationary employee firings,\" she stated in her affidavit.\n\nWhen DiMartini asked the Treasury Department official why they were firing so many probationary employees, she was told that the order came from OPM , which was staffed by Trump appointees and members of DOGE.\n\nIn her affidavit, DiMartini confirmed what Rillotta wrote in his emails - that it was false to say probationary employees were fired for performance. DiMartini's office \"did not review or consider\" any probationary employees' job performance or conduct. Nor did the Treasury Department. \"I know this because this fact was discussed openly in meetings,\" DiMartini stated in her affidavit.\n\nAccording to DiMartini's affidavit, OPM drafted the IRS mass-termination letter. While Treasury officials made several changes to it, the IRS's personnel office where DiMartini worked \"was not permitted to make any changes to the letter,\" DiMartini's affidavit said.\n\nRead More\n\nDiMartini refused to sign the mass-termination letter, according to her affidavit. The then-acting commissioner of the IRS, Douglas O'Donnell, also refused to sign the letter.\n\nWhen thousands of affected IRS employees finally received the letter, it arrived from a generic email account. No agency official's name appeared anywhere in the document.\n\nDo you have any information we should know about the IRS, DOGE or the Trump administration's mass firings?

      "text": "Some Americans Have Already Been Caught in Trump's Immigration Dragnet. More Will Be.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAbout a week after President Donald Trump took office, Jonathan Guerrero was sitting at the Philadelphia car wash where he works when immigration agents burst in.\n\nThe agents didn't say why they were there and didn't show their badges, Guerrero recalled. So the 21-year-old didn't get a chance to explain that although his parents were from Mexico, he had been born right there in Philadelphia.\n\n\"They looked at me and made me put my hands up without letting me explain that I'm from here,\" Guerrero said.\n\nAn agent pointed his gun at Guerrero and handcuffed him. Then they brought in other car wash workers, including Guerrero's father, who is undocumented. When agents began checking IDs, they finally noticed that Guerrero was a citizen and quickly let him go.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, man, I don't know who these guys are and what they're doing,\" said Guerrero. \"With anything law-related, I just stay quiet.\"\n\nLess than two months into the new Trump administration, there has been a small but steady beat of reported cases like Guerrero's.\n\nIn Utah, agents pulled over and detained a 20-year-old American after he honked at them. In New Mexico, a member of the Mescalero Apache nation more than two hours from the border was questioned by agents who demanded to see their passport. Earlier this month, a Trump voter in Virginia was pulled over and handcuffed by gun-wielding immigration agents.\n\nIn Texas, a 10-year-old citizen recovering from brain cancer was detained at a Border Patrol checkpoint and eventually deported to Mexico with her undocumented parents and other citizen siblings in February. The family said it was rushing her to an emergency checkup in Houston when Border Patrol agents ignored a hospital letter that the family had used to go through checkpoints before. An agency spokesperson said the family's account was inaccurate but declined to provide specifics.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many citizens have faced the Trump administration's dragnet so far. And while previous administrations have mistakenly held Americans too, there's no firm count of those incidents either.\n\nThe government does not release figures on citizens who have been held by immigration authorities. Neither Customs and Border Protection nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which handles interior immigration enforcement, would provide numbers to ProPublica on how many Americans have been mistakenly detained.\n\nExperts and advocates say that what is clear to them is that Trump's aggressive immigration policies - such as arrest quotas for enforcement agents - make it likely that more citizens will get caught up in immigration sweeps.\n\n\"It's really everyone - not just noncitizens or undocumented people - who are in danger of having their liberty violated in this kind of mass deportation machinery,\" said Cody Wofsy, the deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAsked about reports of Americans getting caught up in administration's enforcement policies, an ICE spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that agents are allowed to ask for citizens' identification: \"Any US immigration officer has authority to question, without warrant, any alien or person believed to be an alien concerning his or her right to be, or to remain, in the United States.\" The agency did not respond to questions about specific cases.\n\nThe U.S. has gone through spasms of detaining and even deporting large numbers of citizens. In the 1930s and 1940s, federal and local authorities forcibly exiled an estimated 1 million Mexican Americans, including hundreds of thousands of American-born children.\n\nSpanning both Obama administrations, an NPR investigation found, immigration authorities asked local authorities to detain about 700 Americans . Meanwhile, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report found that immigration authorities asked to hold roughly 600 likely citizens during Trump's first term. The GAO also found that Trump actually deported about 70 likely citizens .\n\nThe GAO report did not get into any individual cases. But lawsuits brought against federal immigration agencies detail dozens of cases where plaintiffs received a settlement.\n\nWhen local deputies in Pierce County, Washington, arrested Carlos Rios on suspicion of drunken driving in 2019, not even the fact that he had his U.S. passport could convince the deputies - or the ICE agents who took him into federal custody - that he was a citizen.\n\nRios, who immigrated from Mexico in the 1980s and became a citizen in 2000, often carried his passport with him in case he picked up a welding job on a Coast Guard ship or a commercial fishing job that took him into international waters. But no one listened to him when Rios insisted repeatedly that he was a citizen and begged Pierce County jail officials and ICE officers to check his bag. Rios ended up being held for a week. ICE did not comment on the case.\n\nRios received a $125,000 settlement but is still haunted by his time in detention.\n\n\"I don't even have to close my eyes,\" Rios said. \"I remember every single second.\"\n\nThere are other, more recent instances too. This January, in the last days of President Joseph Biden's time in office, Border Patrol conducted raids in Kern County, California, more than four hours from the border.\n\nAmong those detained was Ernesto Campos, a U.S. citizen and owner of a Bakersfield landscaping company. Agents stopped Campos' truck and slashed his tires when he refused to hand over his keys.\n\nAt that point, Campos began recording on his phone and protested that he is a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn the video, agents said they were arresting Campos for \"alien smuggling.\" (His undocumented employee was in the truck with Campos.) Border Patrol told a local TV station that agents were also concerned about human trafficking.\n\nCampos has still not been charged. His lawyer said he was held for four hours.\n\nCampos' case is mentioned in a recent lawsuit by the ACLU of Southern California and the United Farm Workers contending that agents in the same operation detained and handcuffed a 56-year-old grandmother who is a legal permanent resident. The suit argues that Border Patrol agents \"went on a fishing expedition\" that profiled Latinos and farmworkers.\n\nAsked about Campos' case and the lawsuit, Customs and Border Protection said it does not comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nWhile there are a number of fixes the government could make to limit the wrongful detention of citizens, immigration authorities have often failed to follow through.\n\nAfter a series of lawsuits against the Obama administration, ICE began requiring officers to consult with supervisors before detaining someone who claims to be a citizen, and to not arrest someone if the evidence of citizenship \"outweighs evidence to the contrary.\" But the GAO report on mistaken detention of citizens noted that ICE wasn't actually training officers to follow the policy. (In response to the GAO report, ICE said it revised its training materials. It told ProPublica that agents are still following those policies for determining citizenship)\n\nCustoms and Border Protection and ICE are not even required to track how often they hold citizens on immigration charges, the GAO found. While ICE agents could note in their database if someone they've investigated turns out to be a citizen, the GAO found that they are not required to do so. As a result, records are often wrong and left uncorrected even after agents have been told of a mistake. Someone flagged incorrectly in an ICE database once may be forced to deal with questions about their citizenship for years.\n\nRead More\n\nPeter Sean Brown, another U.S. citizen born in Philadelphia, was mistaken more than 20 years ago for a Jamaican national living in the U.S. illegally. When he was later arrested in 2018 for a probation violation, immigration officials requested he be held, despite their own records documenting the case of mistaken identity, his lawyer said.\n\nBrown repeatedly insisted he was a citizen, a claim agents are supposed to immediately review.\n\n\"I'M TRYING TO OBTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING A UNVALID ICE HOLD,\" Brown wrote to guards on April 19, 2018, while still detained at the Monroe County jail in Florida. \"IM A US CITIZEN...HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?\"\n\nICE eventually released him - after three weeks in detention.\n\nMarch 19, 2025: This story originally incorrectly referred to an agency that provided statements to ProPublica.

      "text": "Two Transgender Girls, Six Federal Agencies. How Trump Is Trying to Pressure Maine Into Obedience.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nOn a Monday last month, after a conservative Maine legislator expressed outrage on Facebook about a transgender girl winning a high school pole vaulting event, the hammer of the federal government began to swing.\n\nBy Friday of that week, Feb. 21, President Donald Trump singled out Maine's governor during a White House event and threatened to cut off the state's federal funding. \"See you in court,\" Gov. Janet Mills shot back.\n\nThen came a barrage of investigations and threats: The U.S. Department of Education opened inquiries into the Maine Department of Education and the student's school district , alleging they had violated federal civil rights law. The same day, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services targeted the Maine Education Department , too, as well as the state's university system.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture then launched an investigation into the university system ; and on Tuesday, the university said the USDA had halted funding as the agency investigates \"prospective\" civil rights violations, records show.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice sent a letter that \"Maine should be on notice\" that the agency was poised to sue. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration even pulled $4.5 million for marine research, but it didn't touch the 33 other grantees who get similar funding.\n\nThen last week, the Social Security Administration briefly became the sixth federal agency to target Maine, canceling contracts that allowed hospitals to automatically report births and funeral homes to report deaths.\n\nAlthough the Social Security contracts were reinstated, and the state may reapply for the marine research funding, the moves had already wreaked havoc.\n\nNow, more federal agencies are pressing down on Maine than there are transgender girls competing in girls' sports in the state. Only two transgender girls are competing this school year, according to the Maine Principals' Association.\n\n\"The president is trying to crush the opposition. He's trying to crush Maine,\" said David Webbert, a longtime civil rights attorney in Maine. To Webbert, it's as if Trump is saying: \"'Maine believes in transgender rights? Well, you're going to see what happens to you.'\"\n\nSome view Maine as a test case for how the Trump administration may try to force its policies on states, regardless of existing state laws. In public comments, residents have invoked the state's motto to rally Mainers: \"Dirigo,\" Latin for \"I lead.\"\n\n\"It's Maine now, but what state is it going to be next? This is not just a Maine issue, but Maine spoke up. So right now, it's, 'Let's make an example out of Maine,'\" said Kris Pitts, executive co-director of the nonprofit MaineTransNet.\n\nState officials, thrust into the spotlight, have been trying to avoid becoming more of a target, carefully choosing their words and declining interviews with reporters. And Mills hasn't challenged Trump again publicly on this issue.\n\nThere are signs the administration is preparing to force other states to follow the president's directives: The DOJ recently sent letters to California and Minnesota threatening to sue those states if they don't ban transgender girls from athletics.\n\nThe Trump administration also is taking a multiagency approach with Columbia University. On Friday, several federal agencies canceled a combined $400 million in grants and contracts because, the administration alleged, the university was not sufficiently combatting antisemitism.\n\nThe press release announcing the multimillion-dollar punishment contained a caution for noncompliant institutions: \"Doing business with the Federal Government is a privilege.\"\n\nNearly everything about the blitz of investigations in Maine, including how they're being carried out, is not ordinary.\n\nFederal agencies that don't usually enforce civil rights laws in schools launched inquiries. HHS, for instance, usually focuses on health care access for people with disabilities or language translation, and there's no evidence it's conducted an investigation of Maine in the past 20 years.\n\nNot only did it dive into Maine's policies on transgender athletes, it reached a conclusion with  unprecedented speed.\n\nInvestigations like this typically take months, if not years, according to a review of federal investigation data and records by ProPublica and the Bangor Daily News. But just one business day after announcing the investigation, the federal agency decided the Maine Department of Education wasn't giving girls equal opportunities and had violated Title IX \"by allowing male athletes to compete against female athletes,\" according to a letter from HHS to the state .\n\nIt sent that finding to the general inbox at the Maine attorney general's office after interviewing no one from that office, the Education Department, governor's office or officials from two high schools cited in the letter for allowing transgender athletes to compete against girls, according to those agencies and schools.\n\nThe Maine attorney general's office pointed out that the letter cited an incorrect sum of federal funding that flows to the state. Legal experts also viewed its interpretation of Title IX as problematic. Trump's Feb. 5 \" Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports \" executive order asserted that transgender girls can't play girls' sports under that federal law. But Title IX has never required schools to exclude them, and Trump's order can't rewrite federal law, said Deborah Brake, a professor at University of Pittsburgh School of Law.\n\n\"The president can put out an executive order saying anything he wants,\" Brake said, but \"there has never been a court decision interpreting Title IX to require the exclusion of transgender girls from girls' sports.\"\n\nThe president is trying to crush the opposition. He's trying to crush Maine.\n\nIn a statement, the agency reiterated that Maine could lose federal funding if it didn't comply with its position. \"HHS will investigate and enforce Title IX to the full extent permitted by law to uphold fairness, safety, dignity, and biological truth in women's and girls' educational athletic opportunities. Men have no place in women's sports,\" it said.\n\nThe USDA investigation of the University of Maine, launched on a Saturday, the day after Mills' exchange with Trump, also is unusual. In announcing the investigation, the department said $100 million to the university was at risk because of the state's \"blatant disregard\" of Trump's order; a university system spokesperson said that amount reflected multiple years of funding.\n\nThen came a series of questions, according to records obtained by the Bangor Daily News and ProPublica . At 10:50 a.m. the following Tuesday, a USDA official sent a University of Maine official 10 yes-or-no questions about its transgender athlete policies - and gave her 1 hour, 10 minutes to respond. The officials agreed to discuss the questions over a Zoom call, and, about five hours after that call, the USDA sent a list of follow-up questions. The agency wanted those answers by 1 p.m. the following day.\n\nSherron Jernigan, a USDA civil rights director for the animal and plant inspection service, sent the questions :\n\n\"Does the University of Maine System provide sex-separated toilet, locker room, and shower facilities for male student athletes and female student athletes?\" The university answered \"yes.\"\n\n\"Does the University of Maine System permit a biological male to participate in individual or team contact sports with biological females?\" The university answered \"no.\"\n\nThe university's Title IX coordinator told the USDA that none of the seven universities within the system has transgender athletes participating in NCAA-sanctioned sports. (Of the more than 500,000 students who compete on NCAA teams across the country, fewer than 10 are transgender, the league's president recently told a U.S. Senate panel.)\n\nIn her response to follow-up questions, Liz Lavoie, the university's Title IX coordinator, added that the USDA had not given the university \"any explanation as to the basis or scope of its inquiry, or the steps in the process.\"\n\n\"Further, we have been given mere hours to respond to both sets of questions and we are responding in good faith but find the approach concerning given the lack of official service and the informal nature that the questions and interview have been presented,\" Lavoie wrote.\n\nThe USDA did not issue any findings after the questioning, but the agency already is taking action. On Tuesday, the university said the USDA had frozen funding that could affect research on everything from the contamination of Maine farms by forever chemicals to the sustainability of Maine's lobster industry. Last fiscal year, the USDA awarded nearly $30 million to the University of Maine.\n\nA USDA spokesperson said the agency would not comment on a pending investigation.\n\nWebbert, the civil rights attorney, called the federal government's inquiries \"a show.\"\n\n\"It's a political move dressed up, very barely, with a legal process, but it's a fake legal process. So it is very concerning because they're not even trying to make it look like it's due process,\" he said. \"It reeks of pure politics.\"\n\nDoing business with the Federal Government is a privilege.\n\nThe federal government has made no effort to hide the ideological perspective that its various inquiries are seeking to enforce in Maine and the rest of the county, according to documents obtained by ProPublica and the Bangor Daily News. In announcing its action in Maine, HHS said it wanted to \"restore biological truth to the federal government\" and in its findings cited an article from OutKick, a Fox-owned conservative news site with a mission of \"exposing the destructive nature of 'woke' activism.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education - which does have a mandate to investigate gender-based discrimination in schools and, with more than 500 people, dwarfs most of the nation's civil rights enforcement divisions - seemed to conclude that Maine was violating Title IX before it finished investigating.\n\nThe press release announcing the launch of the investigation quoted the department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor: \"It is shameful that Governor Mills refuses to stand with women and girls. Her rejection of the antidiscrimination obligations that Maine voluntarily accepted when it agreed to receive federal taxpayer dollars is unlawful.\"\n\nTrainor linked to \"credible local reporting\" around the pole vaulter in his letter to Maine officials announcing the civil rights investigation. The report came from the Maine Wire, an online outlet founded by a conservative think tank based in the state. The office hasn't made contact with Maine since it notified state agencies of its investigation, according to the Maine agencies.\n\nThe Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMaine's governor never believed her state would receive an impartial investigation. \"I imagine that the outcome of this politically directed investigation is all but predetermined,\" Mills said in a statement after the Education Department investigation began. She has since declined to discuss her view of Maine's transgender athlete policy.\n\nBut she has reiterated that Trump legally can't force the state to violate its own law, the Maine Human Rights Act, which prevents discrimination based on gender identity.\n\nMainers aren't sure what this full-court press will mean for their state; keeping up with it is hard enough. State Sen. Joe Rafferty, a Democrat who co-chairs the Legislature's committee on education and cultural affairs, expressed disbelief when a reporter informed him that HHS' investigation only lasted four days. He wasn't aware it had officially started.\n\n\"That is why I think part of this is a mirage,\" he said of the various investigations. The eventual resolution, he said, is more likely to be settled in a courtroom.\n\nIndeed, HHS referred its finding to the DOJ, which can sue Maine to remove its federal funding. (The health agency also expanded its investigation last week to include the Maine Principals' Association and the Maine high school where the pole vaulter is a student, according to the agency.) The results of that lawsuit could have significant implications, said Brake, the law professor. Not once since Congress enacted Title IX in 1972 has the DOJ ever cut off funding for a violation.\n\nAll the federal attention has been unsettling to some Mainers, welcomed by others who don't want transgender girls playing girls' sports and disruptive to the 625-student Greely High School, which the transgender pole vaulter attends.\n\n\"It's just upsetting to everybody at school to be the center of attention and focus. It's unnerving to go to school and the school is surrounded by police and reporters on every corner,\" Gia Drew, who leads a statewide LGBTQ+ advocacy group called EqualityMaine, said of what she's hearing from the community. \"It's hard to focus on a calculus test when your friends are under attack. It affects not just trans people but everyone who is part of a school system.\"\n\nAfter state Rep. Laurel Libby, a Republican from Auburn, singled out the student on her Facebook page and brought Trump's attention to Maine, parents in the school district planned to show support by displaying signs and handing out treats before classes began, said state Rep. Christina Mitchell, a Democrat who represents Cumberland, home to Greely High School. She's also a school board member in the district.\n\nBut there were television trucks and a police presence surrounding the school, so parents decided not to add to the commotion.\n\nThe Bangor Daily News and ProPublica reached out to the family of the student athlete but received no response. Mitchell said other students, including the transgender student's teammates and competitors, are supportive of her. \"Nobody was making a fuss,\" she said.\n\nAnd many in Maine don't want a fuss. Even as Mills' response to Trump made some proud - you can now buy \"See you in court\" T-shirts - others recognized that it launched Maine into the nation's consciousness. \"You watch it and feel like: 'Oh, all eyes will be here. This will be something big,'\" said Pitts, with MaineTransNet.\n\nLibby and other Republican lawmakers have welcomed the chance to amplify their viewpoint that allowing transgender girls in sports is unsafe and discriminates against girls. Another Republican lawmaker introduced a bill to the Legislature to require transgender athletes to compete on teams matching the gender they were assigned at birth.\n\n\"All of the accomplishments of women over the years are being erased by men masquerading as women, erasing us from the history books,\" Libby said in a weekly address from Maine House Republicans.\n\nWhile Libby has been censured by Democrats who control the Maine House for her initial Facebook post about the pole vaulter, she has continued to make appearances on right-wing media to urge the governor to stop supporting the right of transgender girls to compete in girls' sports. On Tuesday, she filed a lawsuit in Maine District Court against the state's House speaker over the censure, accusing him of stripping her voting rights \"in retaliation for protected speech on a highly important and hotly debated matter of public concern,\" according to the complaint. Her party has rallied around her and her cause.\n\n\"Allowing biological boys to compete with our girls, is not only unpopular, and unfair, but it is also illegal,\" Republican House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor said in a written statement . \"Governor Mills should abandon this indefensible position and uphold Title IX protections for our girls.\"\n\nRead More\n\nMaine institutions being targeted by the federal government have continued to follow state law. And at a regularly scheduled school board meeting at Greely High School on Thursday night, the board president pledged the district's \"unwavering support\" of all students.\n\nMitchell said that Maine may be the federal government's target now, but other states could be next.\n\n\"I think you have to stand up to it. Whatever you think is right, you have to stand up for it, because, if you don't, it'll just keep going and spread to other places,\" Mitchell said. \"We're a small state, but if you give an inch, you know?\"\n\nEli Hager contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI pursue stories about abuses of power - often focusing on schools and education - and stories about private businesses throughout the Midwest.\n\nTips about government and business, particularly in the Midwest, are welcome.

      "text": "Killing Grants That Have Saved Lives: Trump's Cuts Signal End to Government Work on Terrorism Prevention\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nOn a frigid winter morning in 2022, a stranger knocked on the door of a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, during Shabbat service.\n\nSoon after he was invited in for tea, the visitor pulled out a pistol and demanded the release of an al-Qaida-linked detainee from a nearby federal prison, seizing as hostages a rabbi and three worshipers. The standoff lasted 10 hours until the rabbi, drawing on extensive security training, hurled a chair at the assailant. The hostages escaped.\n\n\"We are alive today because of that education,\" Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker said after the attack.\n\nThe averted tragedy at Congregation Beth Israel is cited as a success story for the largely unseen prevention work federal authorities have relied on for years in the fight to stop terrorist attacks and mass shootings. The government weaves together partnerships with academic researchers and community groups across the country as part of a strategy for addressing violent extremism as a public health concern.\n\nA specialized intervention team at Boston Children's Hospital treats young patients - some referred by the FBI - who show signs of disturbing, violent behavior. Eradicate Hate, a national prevention umbrella group, says one of its trainees helped thwart a school shooting in California last year by reporting a gun in a fellow student's backpack. In other programs, counselors guide neo-Nazis out of the white-power movement or help families of Islamist extremists undo the effects of violent propaganda.\n\nThe throughline for this work is federal funding - a reliance on grants that are rapidly disappearing as the Trump administration guts billions in spending.\n\nTens of millions of dollars slated for violence prevention have been cut or are frozen pending review as President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency steamrolls the national security sector. Barring action from Congress or the courts, counterterrorism professionals say, the White House appears poised to end the government's backing of prevention work on urgent threats.\n\n\"This is the government getting out of the terrorism business,\" said one federal grant recipient who was ordered this week to cease work on projects including a database used by law enforcement agencies to assess threats.\n\nThis account is drawn from interviews with nearly two dozen current and former national security personnel, federally funded researchers and nonprofit grant recipients. Except in a few cases, they spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation from the Trump administration.\n\nDozens of academic and nonprofit programs that rely on grants from the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and other agencies are in crisis mode, mirroring the uncertainty of other parts of the government amid Trump's seismic reorganization.\n\n\"We're on a precipice,\" said the leader of a large nonprofit that has received multiple federal grants and worked with Democratic and Republican administrations on prevention campaigns.\n\nProgram leaders describe a chilling new operating environment. Scholars of white supremacist violence - which the FBI for years has described as a main driver of domestic terrorism - wonder how they'll be able to continue tracking the threat without running afoul of the administration's ban on terms related to race and racism.\n\nThe training the rabbi credits with saving his Texas synagogue in 2022 came from a broader community initiative whose federal funding is in limbo. One imperiled effort, FEMA's Nonprofit Security Grant Program, has helped Jewish institutions across the country install security cameras, train staff and add protective barriers, according to the nonprofit Secure Community Network, which gives security advice and monitors threats to Jewish communities nationwide.\n\nIn July 2023, access-control doors acquired through the grant program prevented a gunman from entering Margolin Hebrew Academy in Memphis. In 2021, when gunfire struck the Jewish Family Service offices in Denver, grant-funded protective window film stopped bullets from penetrating the building.\n\n\"These are not hypothetical scenarios, they are real examples of how NSGP funds prevent injuries and deaths,\" Michael Masters, director of the Secure Community Network, wrote this month in an op-ed in The Jerusalem Post calling for continued funding of the program .\n\nNow the security grants program has been shelved as authorities and Jewish groups warn of rising antisemitism . The generous reading, one Jewish program leader said, is that the funds were inadvertently swept up in DOGE cuts. Trump has been a vocal supporter of Jewish groups and, as one of his first acts in office, signed an executive order promising to tackle antisemitism .\n\nStill, the freeze on grants for synagogue protections has revived talk of finding new, more independent funding streams.\n\nThroughout Jewish history, the program director said, \"we've learned you need a Plan B.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFor more than two decades, the federal government has invested tens of millions of dollars in prevention work and academic research with the goal of intervening in the crucial window known as \"left of boom\" - before an attack occurs.\n\nThe projects are diffuse, spread across several agencies, but the government's central clearinghouse is at Homeland Security in the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships, often called CP3. The office houses a grant program that since 2020 has awarded nearly $90 million to community groups and law enforcement agencies working at the local level to prevent terrorism and targeted violence such as mass shootings.\n\nThese days, CP3 is imploding. Nearly 20% of its workforce was cut through the dismissal of probationary employees March 3. CP3 Director Bill Braniff , an Army veteran who had fiercely defended the office's achievements in LinkedIn posts in recent weeks, resigned the same night.\n\n\"It is a small act of quiet protest, and an act of immense respect I have for them and for our team,\" Braniff wrote in a departing message to staff that was obtained by ProPublica. In the note, he called the employees \"wrongfully terminated.\"\n\nSome of this year's CP3 grant recipients say they have no idea whether their funding will continue. One awardee said the team is looking at nightmare scenarios of laying off staff and paring operations to the bone.\n\n\"Everybody's trying to survive,\" the grantee said. \"It feels like this is a tsunami and you don't know how it's going to hit you.\"\n\nCurrent and former DHS officials say they don't expect the prevention mission to continue in any meaningful way, signaling the end to an effort that had endured through early missteps and criticism from the left and right.\n\nThe prevention mission evolved from the post-9/11 growth of a field known as countering violent extremism, or CVE. In early CVE efforts, serious scholars of militant movements jostled for funding alongside pseudo-scientists claiming to have discovered predictors of radicalization. CVE results typically weren't measurable, allowing for inflated promises of success - \"snake oil,\" as one researcher put it.\n\nWorse, some CVE programs billed as community partnerships to prevent extremism backfired and led to mistrust that persists today. Muslim advocacy groups were incensed by the government's targeting of their communities for deradicalization programs, blaming CVE for stigmatizing law-abiding families and contributing to anti-Muslim hostility. Among the most influential Muslim advocacy groups, it is still taboo to accept funding from Homeland Security.\n\nDefenders of CP3, which launched in 2021 from an earlier incarnation, insist that the old tactics based on profiling are gone. They also say there are now more stringent metrics to gauge effectiveness. CP3's 2024 report to Congress listed more than 1,000 interventions since 2020, cases where prevention workers stepped in with services to dissuade individuals from violence.\n\nThe probationary employees who were dismissed this month represented the future of CP3's public health approach to curbing violence, say current and former DHS officials. They were terminated by email in boilerplate language about poor performance, a detail that infuriated colleagues who viewed them as accomplished social workers and public health professionals.\n\nThere were no consultations with administration officials or DOGE - just the ax, said one DHS source with knowledge of the CP3 cuts. Promised exemptions for national security personnel apparently didn't apply as Trump's Homeland Security agenda shrinks to a single issue.\n\n\"The vibe is: How to use DHS to go after migrants, immigrants. That is the vibe, that is the only vibe, there is no other vibe,\" the source said. \"It's wild - it's as if the rest of the department doesn't exist.\"\n\nThis week, with scant warning, Homeland Security cut around $20 million for more than two dozen programs from another wing of DHS, including efforts aimed at stopping terrorist attacks and school shooters.\n\nA Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed \"sweeping cuts and reforms\" aimed at eliminating waste but did not address questions about specific programs. DHS \"remains focused on supporting law enforcement and public safety through funding, training, increased public awareness, and partnerships,\" the statement said.\n\nOne grant recipient said they were told by a Homeland Security liaison that targeted programs were located in places named on a Fox News list of \"sanctuary states\" that have resisted or refused cooperation with the government's deportation campaign. The grantee's project was given less than an hour to submit outstanding expenses before the shutdown.\n\nThe orders were so sudden that even some officials within the government had trouble coming up with language to justify the termination notices. They said they were given no explanation for how the targeted programs were in violation of the president's executive orders.\n\n\"I just don't believe this is in any way legal,\" said one official with knowledge of the cuts.\n\nCuts are reshaping government across the board, but perhaps nowhere more jarringly than in the counterterrorism apparatus. The administration started dismantling it when the president granted clemency to nearly 1,600 defendants charged in connection with the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe pardons overturned what the Justice Department had celebrated as a watershed victory in the fight against domestic terrorism.\n\nSenior FBI officials with terrorism expertise have left or are being forced out in the purge of personnel involved in the Jan. 6 investigation. In other cases, agents working terrorism cases have been moved to Homeland Security to help with Trump's mass deportation effort, a resource shift that runs counter to the government's own threat assessments showing homegrown militants as the more urgent priority. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWithout research backing up the enforcement arm of counterterrorism, analysts and officials say, the government lacks the capacity to evaluate rapidly evolving homegrown threats.\n\nResearchers are getting whiplash as grant dollars are frozen and unfrozen. Even if they win temporary relief, the prospect of getting new federal funding in the next four years is minimal. They described pressure to self-censor or tailor research narrowly to MAGA interests in far-left extremism and Islamist militants.\n\n\"What happens when you're self-silencing? What happens if people just stop thinking they should propose something because it's 'too risky?'\" said one extremism scholar who has advised senior officials and received federal funding. \"A lot of ideas that could be used to prevent all kinds of social harms, including terrorism, could get tossed.\"\n\nAmong the projects at risk is a national compilation of threats to public officials, including assassination attempts against Trump; research on the violent misogyny that floods social media platforms; a long-term study of far-right extremists who are attempting to disengage from hate movements. The studies are underway at research centers and university labs that, in some cases, are funded almost entirely by Homeland Security. A stop-work order could disrupt sensitive projects midstream or remove findings from public view.\n\n\"There are both national security and public safety implications for not continuing to study these very complicated problems,\" said Pete Simi, a criminologist at Chapman University in California who has federally funded projects that could be cut.\n\nOne project never got off the ground before work was suspended.\n\nSix months ago, the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department, announced the Domestic Radicalization and Violent Extremism Research Center of Excellence as a new hub for \"understanding the phenomenon\" of extremist violence.\n\nWork was scheduled to start in January. The website has since disappeared and the future of the center is in limbo.\n\nOther prevention initiatives in jeopardy at the Justice Department include grant programs related to hate crimes training, which has been in demand with recent unrest on college campuses. In the first weeks of the Trump administration, grant recipients heard a freeze was coming and rushed to withdraw remaining funds. Grant officers suggested work should cease, too, until directives come from the new leadership.\n\nAnne Speckhard, a researcher who has interviewed dozens of militants and works closely with federal counterterrorism agencies, pushed back. She had around 200 people signed up for a training that was scheduled for days after the first funding freeze. Slides for the presentation had been approved, but Speckhard said she wasn't getting clear answers from the grant office about how to proceed. She decided to go for it.\n\nRead More\n\n\"I think the expected response was, 'You'll just stop working, and you'll wait and see,' and that's not me,\" said Speckhard, whose International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism receives U.S. funding along with backing from Qatar and private donations.\n\nAs the virtual training began, Speckhard and her team addressed the murkiness of the Justice Department's support in a moment that drew laughter from the crowd of law enforcement officers and university administrators.\n\n\"We said, 'We think this is a DOJ-sponsored training, and we want to thank them for their sponsorship,'\" Speckhard said. \"'But we're not sure.'\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nFrom Washington, I cover national security issues, with a focus on militant movements and counterterrorism efforts.\n\nI'm interested in tips about counterterrorism, court cases involving surveillance or civil liberties, national security personnel changes, threat assessments and the proximity of extremist movements to federal power.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "They Worked to Prevent Death. The Trump Administration Fired Them.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nEvery day, they tackled complex issues with life-or-death stakes:\n\nA failure to get donor organs to critically ill patients.\n\nTobacco products designed to appeal to kids.\n\nMaternal and infant death.\n\nThey were hired after lawmakers and bureaucrats debated and negotiated and persuaded their colleagues - sometimes over the course of years - to make those problems someone's job to solve.\n\nThen, this month, they were fired as part of President Donald Trump's widespread purge of federal workers. Suddenly, the future of their public health missions was in question.\n\nThe White House hasn't released figures on how many have been fired, but news reports have begun to take stock: about 750 workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which plays a central role responding to pandemics; more than 1,000 staffers at the National Institutes of Health , which funds and conducts life-saving research; dozens at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which manages public health care and insurance programs; and scores of employees at the Food and Drug Administration , which oversees the safety of food, drugs and medical devices.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vowed to gut the federal health centers, stating \"entire departments\" at the FDA should be cut. Neither the administration nor the federal agencies responded to ProPublica's questions, but a White House spokesperson has previously said they were removing newer employees who were \"not mission critical.\"\n\n\"The implications for the health of the public are grave,\" said Susan Polan, an associate executive director at the American Public Health Association, which is suing the Department of Government Efficiency , the group leading the firings, for violating federal transparency laws. \"It is unfathomable that anybody thinks these cuts have value and are doing anything other than being performative.\"\n\nProPublica reporters have spoken with dozens of federal workers employed in roles safeguarding the American public from harm. They described losing critical positions they'd spent years training for. Many expressed fear at what would happen to the work they left behind.\n\nProPublica is recording the casualties of the purge, highlighting the scale of what is being lost as public health programs and seasoned experts are caught in the Trump administration's blunt-force drive to shrink the federal government.\n\nFor more than a decade, Dustin Brace has worked various federal jobs, serving as an emergency 911 dispatcher for the Navy and, as a member of the Coast Guard, responding to major chemical and oil spills. \"I loved working to protect the American people,\" he said. \"I never thought that I would leave the government.\"\n\nLast year, when he joined the FDA, his mission was no different. As a social scientist at the agency's Center for Tobacco Products, he helped regulate e-cigarettes and related items. Some were being designed to look like kid-friendly foods , resembling cans of grape soda, or decorated with cartoons, like unicorns eating pancakes. In recent years, more young children had been landing in emergency rooms, poisoned by liquid nicotine. And once in a while, devices explode - in people's pockets, or hands, or faces. One man died after shrapnel entered his brain .\n\nEvery week, Brace scrutinized new product applications to ensure that they would not appeal to children and that the devices were safe for consumer use. The work required a close and careful review of thousands of pages of documents, combing them for hidden hazards. \"The work takes time to be done properly,\" he said.\n\nHis job, and the center as a whole, were born out of a bipartisan understanding that the tobacco industry needed to be regulated. It wasn't until 2009, after decades of industry pushback , that the FDA finally gained the broad legal authority to do so.\n\nIf you work or have worked at a government agency, we want to hear from you.

Like those sent to other federal workers, his contained boilerplate language citing poor performance, even though Brace had received favorable reviews over the past year, according to his assessment records.\n\nBrace estimated that more than 10% of staff at the center's science office were terminated in the past week.\n\n\"Things are going to slow down,\" Brace said. \"More mistakes may be made because the workload is so much higher.\"\n\nWhen Arielle Kane last year joined a team working on an innovative federal program to make childbirth safer in the U.S., the mission spoke to her.\n\nShe could save lives.\n\nAmerica has the worst mortality rate among high-income countries for pregnant and postpartum women , and those in underserved communities face some of the highest risks. Their babies also are in danger if their moms can't access prenatal care or be seen quickly for complications because they live in so-called \"maternal deserts\" where obstetric care isn't available or is limited.\n\nKane's program, housed under CMS, was created to support mothers on Medicaid - increasing access to birth centers, doulas and midwives, cutting down on risky procedures like C-sections and tracking outcomes like low infant birth weight. Better blood-pressure monitoring could prevent life-threatening complications like preeclampsia. Extra attention paid to depression and substance use could head off equally devastating consequences.\n\nIt officially launched on Jan. 1 , and Kane was excited about the possibilities.\n\nBut after Trump's inauguration, they were instructed to halt data collection on race and ethnicity, which troubled many of them. Racial disparities are pervasive in maternal health. Black women are three times more likely than white women to die from a pregnancy-related cause and more than twice as likely to have a stillbirth. Kane said she also was told not to communicate with state officials or attend an upcoming conference on maternal health.\n\nThen, just a month and a half after the launch, Kane and three of her colleagues were fired. With two others planning to leave at the end of the month, she said, the team will be reduced by nearly half.\n\n\"I'm just so angry,\" Kane said. \"This model that has a lot of potential is just being gutted. What does that mean for all of the potential impacts we could have had?\"\n\nFor more than a decade, Amy Paris worked for federal agencies as a problem solver: retooling overly bureaucratic and cumbersome processes to make them easier for the public to navigate.\n\nLast year, she was hired to help reform the nation's organ procurement and transplantation network, a public-private partnership that connects organ donors to patients in vital need of a transplant.\n\nThe program had recently come under fire. As thousands of patients were dying on waitlists, some donor organs weren't even being used. Multiple kidneys had to be thrown out because of transport delays - couriers not picking them up in time or airlines misplacing them. One was accidentally left on an airport luggage trolley.\n\nAfter federal and Senate investigations detailed numerous failures, including an archaic information technology system, the Health Resources and Services Administration announced a modernization initiative in March 2023.\n\nParis joined the team last October as a deputy digital services lead, working with transplant surgeons, technology experts and data scientists on upgrades. \"We were making headway,\" she said. \"We had alignment from Democrats and Republicans on the Hill, we had funding, and they were hiring more of us.\"\n\nRead More\n\nAs a new employee, she figured she would be one of the first to go in the federal workforce purge. Even so, she was devastated when she received her notice.\n\nAbout half of her team was laid off, she said, which sets the reform effort back indefinitely. After her firing, a planned trip to investigate the underlying technology of the network system had to be canceled.\n\n\"We are hollowing out our government in a way that is going to hurt people and is going to get people killed,\" she said. \"That is the scariest thing in the world.\"\n\nWe are still reporting.

Read it now .\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at closing the education department as part of a broader push to shrink the federal government.\n\nThe shutdown cannot be completed without congressional approval, setting the stage for a political and legal battle over the agencyâs role.\n\nThe Department of Education is responsible for offering federal grants and loans to college students , as well as providing funds to low-income schools and disabled students, but has no role in determining curricula or operating schools, which is primarily left to states and local districts.\n\nThe executive order directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to shutter the department aside from some critical requirements required by law, as well as continue to provide â the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.â\n\nGetting congressional approval and overcoming legal battles to shutter the education department will be challenging, but Trumpâs rhetoric, along with massive layoffs at the agency, has already â radically transformed â the agency, Chalkbeat wrote. Education advocates fear that even if the departmentâs main functions remain intact, Trumpâs efforts to minimize its role will endanger critical expertise and studentsâ civil rights, and risk the loss of billions in federal funding to state and local education budgets. Despite the administrationâs vow to preserve funding for rural and low-income schools, staff reductions at the department have left the fate of those grants unclear. Thereâs a risk that rural schools â will have to do even more with even less ,â an education expert told NPR.\n\nTrumpâs plan to shut down the education department is rooted in a longstanding conservative movement against publicly funded education, Chris Lehmann of progressive magazine The Nation noted. The administration eventually hopes to replace public education with a privatized model of schooling by invoking â moral panics â over diversity initiatives and critical race theory, Lehmann argued. The conservative New York Postâs editorial board argued, however, that the DOE has been more of a â gift to teachers unions and the left ,â lamenting that it has failed to benefit students or lead to greater academic achievement. According to libertarian think tank Cato Institute, the DOEâs incompetence and high costs are an â albatross around [the] neck] of American education .â\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "Massie tests Trumpâs appetite for a primary fight\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to take down Rep. Thomas Massie before. Now heâs trying again, at the peak of his power in the GOP â and might even succeed this time.\n\nIt all depends on how much effort Trump and his allies want to put into finding a worthy opponent for the Kentucky Republican congressman â and whether itâs worth the effort ahead of a 2026 midterm campaign that will surely threaten Republicansâ control of the House.\n\nMassie provoked Trump last week by casting the lone Republican vote against the partyâs government funding plan, sending the president to social media to declare that âHE SHOULD BE PRIMARIED.â Since then, Trumpâs former co-campaign manager has taunted Massie, as the eccentric yet popular Kentuckian revealed his fundraising totals have spiked.\n\nTrump has vowed to topple GOP lawmakers before, with varying degrees of ultimate investment â and success. He backed a successful challenger to former Rep. Bob Good, the onetime Freedom Caucus chair who initially endorsed Trump rival Ron DeSantis in 2024.\n\nBut the partyâs ranks are peppered with incumbents, from Rep. Laurel Lee to now-Senate Majority Leader John Thune , whoâve drawn Trumpâs wrath and later earned his favor (or who defeated the foe he backed, like Sen. Lisa Murkowski). And unlike in 2020, there is a more serious behind-the-scenes push to find a challenger well ahead of the primary.\n\nâThe difference this time: the best candidate will be recruited locally,â a person familiar with the push to oust Massie told Semafor, adding that the congressmanâs critics donât want him to be able to say his primary challenger was ââhandpickedâ in Washington.â\n\nAlthough Massie hasnât faced the full might of Trumpâs base in a primary before, his objections to a pandemic aid bill in 2020 caused the then-president to say he should be evicted from the Republican Party. Massie drew a primary opponent that year, Todd McMurtry, who he easily defeated; he criticized McMurtry for âalt-rightâ social media posts.\n\nThis time around, Massieâs adversaries hope a better recruit, with Trumpâs endorsement and financial backing, might increase their chances of beating him.\n\nBut the incumbent doesnât sound worried about an onslaught that he said has shown off his independence from Trump and boosted his conservative cred.\n\nâThe accusation theyâre making against me actually reinforces the base that I have in Kentucky,â Massie told Semafor. âSo what they do is, they try to run âto the Trumpâ of me, instead of to the right of me.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nAnother person familiar with the push to defeat Massie said his foesâ ideal candidate would hail from the district and have crossover appeal to MAGA loyalists, as well as to Reagan-era Republicans disenchanted with Massieâs libertarian leanings.\n\nIf thereâs an attempt to primary the 54-year-old Massie, Trump will likely have allies against him. The Republican Jewish Coalition has vowed to join Trump in supporting an intraparty opponent, a sign of frustration with Massieâs resistance to what he has called excessive US support for Israel.\n\nAnd the American Israel Public Affairs Committee has already vowed to spend against Massie if he tries to run for retiring Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnellâs seat. (Massie hasnât publicly aired any interest in that campaign.)\n\nA big wild card is Trump himself, and whether he might change his mind again about Massie. The president endorsed Massie in 2022, when his primary challenger didnât break 16%, before later turning on him this year.\n\nâMassie is formidable, even with Trump and others having him in their crosshairs,â former Kentucky secretary of state Trey Grayson, who lost a GOP primary to Massie ally Sen. Rand Paul in 2010, told Semafor.\n\nâThis is obviously the best opportunity for someone to run against him, but itâs still a big challenge,â Grayson added.\n\nThe question isnât whether Trump wants Massie gone but whether heâll throw the full weight of his power against a fellow Republican while juggling so many other priorities. Trump may simply care more about the heavy lift of getting his agenda through the House than ending Massieâs career.\n\nAnd itâs not like Massieâs vote against the funding bill was a surprise. He opposed the GOP leadershipâs preferred budget and stood firm as the only no vote on House Speaker Mike Johnsonâs reelection in January.\n\nLove him or hate him, Massie sticks to his positions. That has earned him respect in the Republican conference, as well as plenty of pro-Trump friends.\n\nIf you ask Massie, Trump isnât even necessarily serious about supporting a primary opponent.\n\nWhy? Because the congressman, no matter how obstreperous he may be when it comes to defying leadership, is a proven winner.\n\nâHe doesnât like to back losers,â Massie said. âAnd so even though heâs saying he would get in the race against me â¦ I think it was more of a threat than a promise.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed in a phone call Tuesday on a temporary pause on attacks on energy and infrastructure in the Ukraine war.\n\nIf sealed, the initial pact would be followed by a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, and then a full ceasefire, according to readouts from Moscow and Washington. Negotiations are set to begin immediately in the Middle East, the White House said.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had told Russiaâs military to âimmediatelyâ cease targeting Ukraineâs energy infrastructure for 30 days. In the more than 90-minute-long phone call the two leaders apparently agreed that the war in Ukraine should be brought to an end with a durable peace âÂ but crucially, the Putin did not agree to the broader ceasefire Washington and Kyiv have pushed for.\n\nUkraineâs President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he supported the new energy and infrastructure ceasefire proposal, and said he hoped to speak with Trump shortly: âI think it will be right that we will have a conversation with President Trump and we will know in detail what the Russians offered the Americans or what the Americans offered the Russians .â\n\nAccording to the Russian readout of the call, Putin stressed a number of conditions for resolving the conflict, including âthe complete cessation of foreign military aid and the provision of intelligence to Kyivâ and the need to stop mobilization in Ukraine â those terms run counter to Kyivâs desire for an unconditional ceasefire, leaving the future of negotiations unclear. âThey are talking, but really the real takeaway is there is no ceasefire agreement,â one analyst told Reuters.\n\nWhile one Ukrainian analyst said Russiaâs demands were âimpossibleâ for Kyiv to meet, Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev described it as âa PERFECT call .â\n\nAfter the conversation, Ukrainian media reported that Russia had struck targets across Ukraine, with politicians and local outlets said led to power outages in one eastern city.\n\nIt is unclear whether the two leaders discussed where a ceasefire line would be drawn, but ahead of the talks, Trump had told reporters, â I think we will be talking about land .â\n\nâWeâll be talking about power plants,â he had said, likely a reference to Ukraineâs Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, which Russia occupied in 2022.\n\nTrump is also considering whether to recognize Crimea , which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, as Russian territory as part of any future peace deal, Semafor reported.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship"

      "text": "How Trump toppled his partyâs national security orthodoxy\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPresident Donald Trump is bulldozing over generations of Republican national security orthodoxy.\n\nHe canned the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. CQ Brown, who enjoyed broad GOP support, as well as several other top military officials. Heâs pulling closer to Russia on the world stage after Republican hawks last year labored to deliver Ukraine more money to fight Vladimir Putin. And heâs toppled the US Agency of International Development, drawing back from decades-old bipartisan soft power strategies. His national security appointees largely share his noninterventionist worldview, leaving little internal counterweight to his moves.\n\nPerhaps whatâs most remarkable, though, is the lack of public tension between the partyâs hawks and its noninterventionist wing â the sort of ugly internal scuffles that marked Trumpâs first term. Thatâs in part because Trumpâs remodeled GOP elected and elevated dozens of new, like-minded lawmakers.\n\nâItâs not isolationism. Itâs realism,â Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., said of Trumpâs approach to national security. âThe party has changed. President Trump has changed the party in his own image.â\n\nThe old-line hawks who remain in office arenât fully unwilling to push back against Trumpâs more pro-Russia instincts, and theyâre already urging him not to cut a deal with Putin that shortchanges Ukraine. Theyâre also breaking with Trump over his false assertion that Ukraine started the war and are aiming to ensure his appointees cater to their views, too.\n\nBut the shift Trump imposed upon his party is already in place; the White House acknowledged its policy decisions over the past month essentially finalizes the break from the establishment consensus forged during the George W. Bush administration. A White House official described the presidentâs positions using the same ârealismâ term used by Banks, arguing that Trumpâs approach is not to adhere to any outdated âdoctrine.â\n\nâIn dealing with the realities of what is actually going on, each conflict and each issue is completely different from each other,â the official said.\n\nTrumpâs focus on US interests first is meant to cause ripple effects throughout the world, a national security adviser added.\n\nâIt all falls in line with Trumpâs perspective, which is: Thereâs no greater deterrent to chaos in the world than a strong America at home,â the NSC official told Semafor.\n\nA handful of Republicans are still questioning the firing of Brown and other top military officials. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was Trumpâs prerogative but  âI do not think, based on the merits, that the decision to fire them was warranted.â\n\nWhen it comes to ending the war in Ukraine, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said âany scenario where Putin comes out feeling like he even tied â let alone won â I canât support.â Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said the Trump administration âroyally screwed upâ by siding with Russia against a United Nations resolution marking its role in starting the war.\n\nBut for the most part, after Congress supplied Ukraine with weapons for years, itâs Trumpâs show now.\n\nâI donât think a bill to send more money to Ukraine right now would pass,â said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La.\n\nKennedy added that Congress has little choice at this point but to be deferential. Itâs a stark change from eight years ago, when Trump at times drew the ire of GOP hawks like the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is no longer majority leader.\n\nEven the Senate Armed Services Committee is now stocked with Trump allies on national security.\n\nâItâs a pivot to realism,â said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., who went to Munich this month to tell European allies to step up. âItâs where I think the center of gravity is moving toward.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nWith the Cabinet largely confirmed, one of the most intriguing Trump nominees is Elbridge Colby, tapped as the Pentagonâs No. 3. Heâs raised eyebrows in the party by arguing for less focus on the Middle East and more on China, a break from the long-term Republican focus on Iran.\n\nYet Colbyâs trips to Capitol Hill may be helping him make headway. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said she had a âreally great meeting with himâ and that heâs having positive visits with GOP senators. Approached in the Capitol complex Tuesday, Colby declined comment.\n\nStill, Colby may have to adjust some of his views to win confirmation, such as his skepticism of preserving the option to use force to stop Iranâs nuclear program. Several high-profile Trump picks have made similar conversions on defense policy, like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbardâs embrace of surveillance programs that she previously criticized.\n\nâThese are not people who are anything but âpeace through strength,ââ the NSC official said.\n\nThat Colby may win over skeptical lawmakers by adjusting some of his personal beliefs, as Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did earlier this year, shows that unconventional Trump nominees now have a clear path to win confirmation.\n\nItâs for a simple reason, if you ask the White House.\n\nâEveryone has learned at this point, if you go up against Trump, youâll lose,â the White House official said.\n\nThe Senate also will have to confirm Lt. Gen. Dan Caine as a replacement for Brown, who was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate in 2023. Though Democrats said Caineâs ouster was leading to a more politicized military, Republicans mostly shrugged.\n\nâI like [Brown] a lot, but Caineâs a better fit,â said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. â[Trump] just trusts Caine.â\n\nDemocrats are entering strange territory where many in their party are more conventionally hawkish than most Republicans. They do not seem to like it.\n\nâWe need people in both parties standing up to at least proclaim whatâs obvious â in this case, that Russia invaded Ukraine,â said Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., referring to Trumpâs false claim that Ukraine started the war.\n\nTrump has made significant changes with only gentle pushback from Republicans on Capitol Hill. From bashing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to siding against the UN resolution on Ukraine to remaking the top military rungs, Trump appears to be gleefully thumbing his nose at old-school Republicans.\n\nHeâs at the peak of his power â on foreign policy as well as domestic issues â and he knows it.\n\nAnd in case you thought there might be big changes in the next GOP primary, remember that his potential successor, Vice President JD Vance, is cut from the same cloth.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "A TIME Exclusive: Donald Trump After Hours\n\nFrom where the 45th President works, eats and sleeps, everything is going just great. Now if only everyone else would see it that way.\n\nBY Michael Scherer and Zeke J. Miller\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY BENJAMIN RASMUSSEN FOR TIME\n\nIn a few minutes, President Donald Trump will release a new set of tweets, flooding social-media accounts with his unique brand of digital smelling salts-words that will jolt his supporters and provoke his adversaries.\n\nNearly a dozen senior aides stand in the Oval Office, crowding behind couches or near door-length windows. This is the way he likes to work, more often than not: in a crowd. He sits behind his desk finishing the tasks of the day, which have included watching new Senate testimony about Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election, by signing orders in red folders with a black Sharpie.\n\nWhen he held the job, Barack Obama tended to treat the Oval Office like a sanctum sanctorum, accessible only for a small circle of advisers to break its silence on a tightly regulated schedule. For Trump, the room functions as something like a royal court or meeting hall, with open doors that senior aides and ­distinguished visitors flock through when he is in the building.\n\nIn practice, it feels much like his old corner office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, minus all the clutter of memorabilia, a place to convene an audience, to broadcast his exceptionalism, to entertain, take photos, amaze and make deals. Some aides still call him \"Mr. Trump,\" and everyone turns to listen when he speaks. His presence always seems to consume the room.\n\nAnd the stream of visitors is constant. Just a few hours earlier, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster had stopped by with a foreign military delegation. Vice President Mike Pence brought by the Prime Minister of Georgia unscheduled for a photo. The New England ­Patriots got to take pictures behind the desk recently, and the President says the billionaire Ronald Lauder, a great collector of art, went crazy when he saw the painting of George Washington above the fireplace. \"Never had people,\" Trump likes to say of Obama's use of the space. \"I use the room. I use it a lot. I had the biggest people in the country here.\"\n\nBut right now, there is something else he wants to show. It's down the hall, in his private dining room in the West Wing, a few steps away. As is often the case when reporters come through, he has a plan, a story he wants to tell. Tonight, at dusk on May 8, he invites three TIME correspondents for a tour of his home and office, followed by a four-course dinner in the Blue Room, the oval-shaped parlor on the first floor of the executive mansion. The first three months of his presidency have been unsettling, a blur of confrontation, policy pivots and regulatory revolution. Financial markets have climbed, cruise missiles have fallen, and the world has watched with trepidation and confusion. In less than 24 hours, Trump will roil the nation again by announcing the firing of his FBI Director, James Comey, who is leading an investigation of his campaign's ties to Russia. It will set off yet another firestorm. But for now, it's showtime once again.\n\n\"You'll see something that is amazing. It just happened,\" he says as he stands up from the desk. \"Come on, I'll show you.\"\n\nTrump, with Pence, watches a replay of Senate hearings from a private dining room near the Oval Office\n\nEach president leaves his mark on the building, and Trump has wasted little time making his. The modern art favored by the Obama family is mostly gone, replaced with classic oils, including portraits of Trump's favorite predecessors, like Andrew Jackson and Teddy Roosevelt. Gold curtains have replaced the maroon ones in the Oval Office, and military-service flag stands have been added around the room, topped by battle ribbons and held in place by heavy brass bases that Trump praises to visitors.\n\nBut few rooms have changed so much so fast as his dining room, where he often eats his lunch amid stacks of newspapers and briefing sheets. A few weeks back, the President ordered a gutting of the room. \"We found gold behind the walls, which I always knew. Renovations are grand,\" he says, boasting that contractors from the General Services Administration resurfaced the walls and redid the moldings in two days. \"Remember how hard they worked? They wanted to make me happy.\"\n\nTrump says he used his own money to pay for the enormous crystal chandelier that now hangs from the ceiling. \"I made a contribution to the White House,\" he jokes. But the thing he wants to show is on the opposite wall, above the fireplace, a new 60-plus-inch flat-screen television that he has cued up with clips from the day's Senate hearing on Russia. Since at least as far back as Richard Nixon, Presidents have kept televisions in this room, usually small ones, no larger than a bread box, tucked away on a sideboard shelf. That's not the Trump way.\n\nA clutch of aides follow him, including McMaster, Pence and press secretary Sean Spicer. The President raises a remote and flicks on the screen, sorting through old recordings of cable news shows, until he comes to what he is after: a clip from the Senate hearing earlier in the day, as broadcast on Fox News. The first clip he shows is of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham speaking to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Graham asks if Clapper stands by his statement that he knows of no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump waits quietly, until Clapper admits that nothing has changed. Trump pantomimes a sort of victory.\n\n\"Yes. He was choking on that,\" the President chortles. \"Is there any record at all of collusion? He was the head of the whole thing. He said no. That's a big statement.\" Trump leaves unmentioned the fact that there is an ongoing FBI counter­intelligence investigation into possible collusion, which has not yet reached any conclusions. Nor does he note that Clapper, out of government for nearly four months, could not possibly know everything the FBI has learned, and likely would have not known all even when he was in office. Trump also leaves unmentioned that he had a meeting that day with his new Deputy Attorney General about firing Comey, the director of that investigation.\n\nBut for now, Trump is focused on his TV. He watches the screen like a coach going over game tape, studying the opposition, plotting next week's plays. \"This is one of the great inventions of all time-TiVo,\" he says as he fast-forwards through the hearing.\n\nThe next clip starts to play, this time showing Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley asking Clapper and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates if they ever requested that the names of Trump, his associates or members of Congress be identified by name, or unmasked, in a legal intelligence intercept. \"Watch them start to choke like dogs,\" Trump says, having fun. \"Watch what happens. They are desperate for breath.\"\n\nClapper, on the screen, pauses several beats to search his memory. \"Ah, he's choking. Ah, look,\" the President says. After a delay, Clapper finally answers, admitting that he had requested an unmasking, which would have been a routine occurrence in his former job. The running Trump commentary continues. \"See the people in the back, people are gasping,\" he says, though it's unclear who he is referring to on the screen. He also mentions the sound of photographers' cameras clicking on the television.\n\nMoments later, the President watches as both Clapper and Yates testify that they had reviewed intercepts containing the unmasked identities of Trump, his associates and members of Congress. This, to Trump, is yet another victory, the lead-lined proof of his still unproven claim that Obama surveilled him before he was sworn in. \"So they surveilled me,\" he says. \"You guys don't write that-wiretapped in quotes. They surveilled me.\"\n\nPresident Trump walking to the residence\n\nThe powers of the presidency are vast, but Trump has discovered in these first months in office that they do not include­ much influence over how his words and actions are consumed by the American people. Among the many frustrations, none seems to burn quite as much as the disrespect he feels he has received from the press, which has steadily failed to reflect his version of reality. The story he wants told is not the one the nation reads and sees.\n\nIn his view, the past months have included a steady string of successes, broken only by occasional missteps, which are invariably overplayed and misinterpreted. After a rough start, an Obamacare replacement passed the House. A red line against the use of chemical weapons has been re-established in Syria. Political prisoners have been released from Egypt.\n\nChina has offered new cooperation to prevent the further development of North Korea's nuclear arsenal. American companies have been arm-twisted into staying in the country, while Trump has personally inserted himself into a handful of negotiations over weapons systems and trade agreements to try to get Americans a better deal.\n\nBut the turmoil of his presidency has so far dominated the headlines, pushing out much of what he considers to be the good news he thinks he deserves. The press has focused on the disruption; his false statements in office; the fear and dislocation in immigrant communities; the many campaign promises, from eliminating the export-import bank to declaring China a currency manipulator, on which Trump has equivocated.\n\nOf the many firestorms he has had to fight, none has burned as brightly as the tweets he sent accusing Obama of wiretapping him at Trump Tower. The head of the FBI, Comey, whom he had discussed firing earlier that day, had testified that there is no evidence that this happened. So he has been arguing that the wiretapping he alleged could include routine surveillance, which was not directed by the White House, of legal surveillance targets who spoke with people in his campaign. That's why he cares so much about the \"unmasking\" testimony. He seeks vindication.\n\nAn elevator in the private residence\n\n\"The truth is, I got a raw deal,\" he says later in the evening, the frustration unmistakable for a man who has spent so much of his life grading himself by headlines. The détente with the press after the election that he had hoped for never came. \"It's gotten worse,\" he says. \"It's one of the things that surprises me.\"\n\nTo cope with this new reality, the President says he is trying a mindfulness trick: he has tried to tune out the bad news about himself. \"I've been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I've been able not to watch or read things that aren't pleasant,\" he will say later in the night, listing off the networks he tries to tune out and the newspapers he struggles to skim. Of course, as his public outbursts indicate, he does not always succeed, but he says he no longer feels a need to know everything said about him. \"In terms of your own self, it's a very, very good thing,\" he says. \"The equilibrium is much better.\"\n\nThe following day, the news of the Senate hearings will once again fail to comport with the meaning he derived from his TiVo. The focus instead will be on Yates' description of how she warned the White House about the apparent duplicity of Trump's first National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, who misled the Vice President about his contacts with Russia. Flynn is now facing an investigation into foreign payments that officials say he failed to report.\n\nTrump can't do anything about that, for the most part. But he can still tweet. So now he walks out of his dining room, followed by the same substantial entourage of senior aides. Back in the Oval Office, he checks in with his waiting staff. \"Did you get that stuff out?\" the President asks of the tweets he had prepared. \"The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax,\" one reads, \"when will the taxpayer funded charade end?\" Dan Scavino, his social-media director, is sitting on the couch. \"Yes, sir. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter. It's everywhere,\" he says.\n\n\"The real story is the surveillance,\" the President responds, before ribbing his staff. \"But my comms people can't get it out.\" They start laughing. But there are even more pressing matters. Trump turns to McMaster, who was the subject of a column on Bloomberg earlier in the day, quoting anonymous sources saying the President was unhappy with his performance. It's another story that Trump declares false. The President thinks he knows where the leak is coming from, which provides some comfort. But for now, he will counterprogram: \"I'm so happy with him,\" Trump says. \"I think he's wonderful.\" And with that, he decides, it is time to go home.\n\nPresident Trump walks down the Grand Staircase\n\nAll Presidents must contain multitudes. But for Trump, the situation is, as usual, bigger, bolder and more complex. At core, he has always been a transactional person. That means he reacts, often in the moment, to the information and people around him. He comes to office with no well-formed ideology and with an evolving understanding of history and government, and a clear goal of using his business acumen to help his most fervent supporters. He is extremely confident in his own judgment, often willing to act alone, to take risks, even when those around him plead caution.\n\nDuring the campaign, this proved to be an enormous asset, allowing him to dispatch more than a dozen opponents and remake the rules of presidential politics. Life in the White House, he has found, is somewhat more restrictive, with far greater stakes. Escalating conflict, which works so well on the campaign trail, has not always yielded results now that he is governing. And at several points, he has had to absorb the fact that the President isn't all-powerful, with his orders blocked by the courts, his wish lists discarded by Congress, a steady stream of leaks from the intelligence community sparking turmoil in his Administration and a media that writes and broadcasts as it pleases.\n\nFrom the Oval Office, it's a 60-yard stroll down the sloped colonnade to the Palm Room doors that lead into his ­government-funded mansion. An elevator operator is waiting for him off the ground-floor hallway. \"Stop up at the second floor, would you?\" asks the President. Then he turns to his guests. \"Did you ever see the Lincoln Bedroom?\" The Vice President, who has walked over as well, takes the stairs. As a matter of protocol, to ensure continuity of government, the two men do not share the same airplane or ride the same lift.\n\nTrump has lived most of these first months alone in his upstairs palace, inhabiting 20,000 square feet of the residence by himself most weeknights, catered to by a household staff that totals nearly 100, including a couple of valets and a handful of butlers. During the Obama years, the second and third floors of the executive mansion were treated as private housing, not a governing space. Obama's daughters and mother-in-law lived in a few of the extra bedrooms. The first time most staff ever got to see the place was the night Obamacare passed in March 2010, when the Obamas decided to throw a party.\n\nThe current President has taken a different tack, inviting staff up regularly for meetings; hosting dinners for old friends, staff and supporters; giving tours; calling foreign leaders from Lincoln's old desk in the Treaty Room, where he will also stay late into the night doing work with his longtime personal aide and bodyguard Keith Schiller. \"The phone system is so amazing here,\" Trump confides as he enters the space. \"This one phone, it splits the words\"-a reference to scrambling technology meant to disrupt eavesdropping.\n\nThe space is far larger than it looks from outside, with a long great hall, appointed with freshly cut yellow flowers. \"This is the kitchen here, a beautiful kitchen,\" he says. \"This is the dining room. Here is a room where we have a guest room.\" Trump shows off the Presidential Seal over the closed door to his suite and the Yellow Oval Room, which opens out onto the Truman Balcony, where Trump's security detail has discouraged him from spending too much time.\n\nIt is the Lincoln Bedroom, however, that for him holds the most symbolic value, with its display of the Gettysburg Address. \"Isn't this incredible?\" Trump asks. \"He was very tall, and this bureau was built for him, with a tall mirror.\" If there is a pressure from the office that he feels in this building, this is where it manifests. The current President talks sympathetically about Lincoln's struggles, the death of his 11-year-old son in this building, the ghosts that haunted him afterward. \"He was a great genius, but he had some difficulty,\" Trump explains. \"He was very distressed after his son died. They say melancholy.\"\n\nBut this is not something to dwell on. A few moments later he is back downstairs, gazing at the East Room. Presidents from Bill Clinton to Harry Truman have joked that the White House was a sort of prison. He doesn't feel that way, he says. \"You have to be a certain type of person,\" he explains. \"People have no idea the beauty of the White House. The real beauty of the White House.\"\n\nThe President has been studying White House history as he puts his personal touch on the building\n\nIn about four weeks , Trump expects his wife and youngest son to join him in the mansion, and when they arrive, life is almost certain to change. But tonight, it's all business, and the Blue Room has been lit with nearly a dozen votive candles, the table is set with yellow roses, and the Washington Monument is neatly framed in the South window.\n\nThe waiters know well Trump's personal preferences. As he settles down, they bring him a Diet Coke, while the rest of us are served water, with the Vice President sitting at one end of the table. With the salad course, Trump is served what appears to be Thousand Island dressing instead of the creamy vinaigrette for his guests. When the chicken arrives, he is the only one given an extra dish of sauce. At the dessert course, he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, instead of the single scoop for everyone else. The tastes of Pence are also tended to. Instead of the pie, he gets a fruit plate.\n\nTrump sees the dinner with TIME as a pitch meeting as much as anything else, with an audience that he does not entirely trust. He wants to go through his many accomplishments, regularly deflecting questions to keep on task. \"The big story is that we are doing a good job for the country,\" the President says. \"We're cutting costs, big, big costs.\" He runs through the tales of his renegotiations with Lockheed and Boeing on the F-35 and F/A-18 Super Hornet fighters. He speaks of asking Apple's Tim Cook to build new manufacturing plants in the U.S. He talks of his plans to renegotiate any future military contracts to make sure they have fixed prices.\n\nAt length, he discusses the small details of military procurement, including the reasons why the more costly digital catapult systems on new aircraft carriers don't work as well as the old steam-driven systems. \"Time and material means you're going to get your ass kicked,\" he says of the common government contracting method, which often leads to cost overruns. \"Who ever heard of time and material?\" He marvels at the technology behind the cruise missiles he launched on an airfield in Syria, noting their ability to maneuver to destroy planes hiding under concrete shelters. He even brings up his efforts to ensure that an African leader, from a country he declines to name, can buy American military equipment despite decades-old human rights concerns.\n\nThe President often gives tours of the mansion to dinner guests\n\nThis is the part of the job that he has clearly come to enjoy, playing businessman for the American people. He brags about the close relationships he believes he has formed with foreign leaders, complimenting Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel on inviting his daughter Ivanka to speak overseas. He boasts of convincing Egypt's leader, General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, to release several political prisoners, including an American­. He even runs through the many ways he has revised the rules of engagement in the war on the Islamic State. \"They keep coming to me, at weird times too,\" he says of requests for approval for drone strikes and Special Forces raids in his earliest days in office.\n\nHis priority was ensuring that the military didn't wait long for the operations to commence. \"I authorized the generals to do the fighting,\" he says. Trump has shifted the authority for final approvals from the White House back to combatant commanders. Other Obama-era restrictions, like strict force-management levels in Syria, proscribing the number of troops or vehicles that can be used at any one time, have been relaxed. As a result, the reliance on foreign contractors to support U.S. forces has ebbed. He mentions the recent death of a high-ranking Islamic State fighter and promises more to come.\n\nAs the dinner goes on, he loosens up, but only a little. He admits a few small mistakes, including a misstep in the fight in the House to repeal Obamacare. \"There was a mistake. We set a date,\" he says of the first deadline by which he hoped to get a vote on the floor in mid-March. \"And when we didn't vote, everyone says, 'Trump fails on health care.'\"\n\nHe joins Pence in describing the hours he spent on the phone with dozens of lawmakers, cajoling them from no to yes. Asked if dealmaking is any different in Washington than in real estate or entertainment, he has a quick answer. \"It's always the same,\" he says. \"You have to know your subject.\"\n\nLeft: President Trump walks along the Colonnade. Right: Trump gives a thumbs up\n\nThen there are the emotional costs of the job, he says. He describes his visit last month to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, just outside of Washington, where he met with wounded service members from Iraq and Afghanistan, as \"incredible and terrible.\" He met one wounded warrior who lost his leg but is learning to walk again with a prosthesis. \"All he wants to do is go back. It's amazing,\" Trump says. \"The spirit is so incredible.\"\n\nAnd for the man who centered his campaign around the notion of \"America first,\" he explains that he is deeply moved by the violence against children in Syria, particularly Bashar Assad's use of chemical weapons on his people. \"I mean, when he actually said they were child actors, who would even think of that?\" Trump says with disgust of the young bodies that were shown on television. \"I felt something had to be done.\"\n\nIt would be wrong to say that the presidency has softened Trump. His willingness to fight is unabated and unfiltered. But he is no longer tethered to a one-way strategy of disruption and conflict. He is willing to back down at times, to adjust course. His chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, who has argued for a dark, generational clearing away of old institutions, found himself effectively demoted, though he remains an important player. On a wide variety of policy issues, Trump has edged toward the center, most notably allowing Congress to negotiate a spending bill that left out a number of his priorities.\n\nWhen asked directly if he feels his Administration has been too combative, he makes a brief allowance. \"It could be my fault,\" he says. \"I don't want to necessarily blame, but there's a great meanness out there that I'm surprised at.\" The inner conflict is clearly evident. This is the same man who just a couple hours earlier had joked about former federal officials choking \"like dogs.\"\n\nSome evenings, Trump works the phones from his residence before retiring for the night\n\nOne senior White House official recently outlined the three rules of Trump for a group of reporters: When you're right, you fight. Controversy elevates message. And never apologize. All of these rules have survived his time in office, if in slightly more modest forms. After bringing new levels of combativeness to the political process, \"the only way you survive is to be combative,\" Trump says now. \"I'll read stories in the New York Times that are so one-sided. Hey, I know when I am successful. I know victory.\"\n\nBut that is not all he has to say. Before the dinner breaks up, the President begins to muse about an alternative world to the one he has helped create. \"It never made sense to me, the level of animosity,\" Trump says. \"All you want to do is, like, Let's have a great military. Let's have low taxes. Let's have good health care. Let's have good education.\"\n\nFor a moment, he seems to be proposing a more civil public space in American democracy, one the Trump campaign did little to foster and which the Trump Administration is unlikely to experience.\n\nIs this real introspection or just more performance for his guests? The answer isn't long in coming. Within a day of the plates being cleared away, Trump takes to Twitter to attack \"Cryin' Chuck Schumer,\" the Democratic Senate leader. He belittles Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal for once misrepresenting his military service-\"he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness.\" No truce is around the corner. President Trump fights on.\n\nYour browser is out of date. Please update your browser at http://update.microsoft.com"

      "text": "Donald Trump Keeps Teasing a Third Term. Here's What to Know\n\nD onald Trump's second term has only just begun, but he and his allies are already teasing the possibility of seeking a third. In April, the Trump Organization began selling \"Trump 2028\" caps as well as t-shirts that say \"Trump 2028 (Rewrite the Rules).\" The Trump War Room campaign social media account shared an image of Trump's son Eric wearing one of the hats.\n\nIn perhaps his most revealing comments on the matter, the President told NBC News last month that he was \"not joking\" about the prospect of running again. \"A lot of people want me to do it,\" Trump said. \"But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One later after the NBC interview, Trump said : \"I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election, was totally rigged.\" (Trump lost to Joe Biden in 2020.) But he added that he's \"not looking at that\"-at least not yet. \"I don't want to talk about a third term now because, no matter how you look at it, we've got a long time to go.\"\n\nThe 22nd Amendment has already had its say: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"\n\nBut the Constitution hasn't proved to be a deterrent for Trump before.\n\nTrump's not the first President to think he should have more than eight years in the White House. Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected to a fourth term in 1944 before he died in 1945, prompting Republicans in Congress to seek a constitutional amendment to formalize term limits-which had before been just a norm established by George Washington to step aside after two terms, though several sought more. Ulysses Grant and Theodore Roosevelt both unsuccessfully vied for third terms, and Woodrow Wilson planned to, too, until he had a stroke during his second.\n\nEven after the 22nd Amendment's ratification in 1951, some Presidents have toyed with the idea of a third term. In 1986, Ronald Reagan half-jokingly raised \"giving it one more try,\" according to a TIME report at the time , which added: \"Reagan has come to see the 22nd Amendment as limiting presidential leverage, and believes it should be repealed, effective after he leaves office. 'It's only democratic,' he said, for citizens to vote for a President as many times as they want. Some future President, that is.\"\n\nAnd Barack Obama said in 2015 that he believed he would win if he could run for a third term, but he admitted that he couldn't because \"the law's the law.\"\n\nTrump, however, doesn't seem so sure about that.\n\n\"No, no I'm not joking. I'm not joking,\" he emphasized to NBC when asked if his repeated talk of a third term was serious. \"I like working,\" he explained. \"But I'm not-it is far too early to think about it.\"\n\nHere's what to know about a potential Trump third term-and what legal experts have to say about it.\n\nOne of the earliest times Trump has floated the concept of extending his presidency beyond a second term was in 2020, while campaigning for reelection in Reno, Nev. \"We're going to win Nevada and we're going to win four more years in the White House,\" he said . \"And then after that we'll negotiate. Right? Because we're probably-based on the way we were treated-we're probably entitled to another four after that.\"\n\nIn an interview with TIME in April 2024, however, Trump dismissed the idea of challenging the 22nd Amendment. \"I'm going to serve one term, I'm gonna do a great job,\" he said . \"And then I'm gonna leave.\"\n\nBut on the trail again in May, at the National Rifle Association's annual meeting, Trump then said : \"You know, FDR 16 years-almost 16 years-he was four terms. I don't know, are we going to be considered three-term? Or two-term?\"\n\n\"I suspect I won't be running again,\"  Trump told his Republican colleagues in the House last November, after his election, before caveating: \"Unless you say, 'He's so good we've got to figure something else out.'\"\n\nIn another interview with TIME , Trump appeared to be somewhat wistful that his last campaign was, seemingly, behind him. \"It's sad in a way. It will never happen again,\" he said.\n\nBut on Jan. 25, after his second-term inauguration, Trump, at an event in Las Vegas, said : \"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve, not once but twice-or three times or four times.\" After cheers from his supporters, Trump smiled and said, \"headlines, for the fake news,\" before clarifying, \"no, it will be to serve twice.\"\n\nTwo days later Trump, speaking to House Republicans in Florida, said : \"I've raised a lot of money for the next race, that I assume I can't use for myself, but I'm not 100% sure because-I don't know, I think I'm not allowed to run again. I'm not sure. Am I allowed to run again, Mike?\" He referred to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was in the audience, before saying, \"I better not get you involved in that argument.\"\n\nAt the National Prayer Breakfast on Feb. 6, Trump said : \"They say I can't run again. That's the expression. 'Sir...' Then somebody said, 'I don't think you can.' Oooh...\"\n\nAnd at a Black History Month reception at the White House on Feb. 20, Trump said , \"Should I run again? You tell me. There's your controversy right there,\" as the audience of his supporters began chants of \"Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\"\n\n\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Trump told NBC on March 30.\n\nPolitico Magazine recently outlined four ways Trump could \"snatch a third term-despite the 22nd Amendment,\" which it summarized as: change the Constitution, sidestep the Constitution, ignore the Constitution, or defy the Constitution.\n\nTrump's Attorney General Pam Bondi acknowledged during her confirmation hearing that a third Trump term would require changing the Constitution. And Trump ally Rep. Andy Ogles (R, Tenn.) introduced a joint resolution to try to kickstart that process on Jan. 23. The resolution seeks to amend the Constitution such that \"no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than three times, nor be elected to any additional term after being elected to two consecutive terms.\" (Critics have suggested the latter clause was included to prevent Obama from taking advantage of such an amendment to seek a third term.)\n\nBut despite Republicans holding a majority in both the House and Senate, amending the Constitution has a much higher threshold than normal bill passage. It requires two-thirds support from both chambers and then ratification by three-fourths of the states.\n\nThere is \"no way\" such an amendment would meet those thresholds, says renowned constitutional scholar and dean of UC Berkeley Law Erwin Chemerinsky. Even political opposition aside, David Schultz, political science and legal studies professor at Hamline University, tells TIME: \"All of this would have to occur within about a two to three year period at most\" in order for Trump to mount a third-term campaign. \"Just the logistics and the politics of this renders it-I want to say-nearly impossible.\"\n\nThe second pathway, according to Politico, is for Trump to \"exploit a little-noticed loophole\" in the Constitution: the 22nd Amendment says a President who has served two terms cannot be elected to a third one, but it does not say such a President cannot serve a third term. Some have read this as to mean that someone like Trump could ascend to the presidency again from the vice presidency.\n\nAttempting that may run into issues with the 12th Amendment, which says \"no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President.\" Bruce Peabody, professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, N.J., tells TIME: \"You have to read that eligibility language in kind of creative ways that I think depart a bit from the constitutional text. You have to say, 'Well, really, what eligibility means is nobody unelectable to the office of President is electable to the office of Vice President.' Maybe-but why doesn't it say that then, right?\" And even then Trump would have to be appointed Vice President, like Gerald Ford was, before ascending to the Presidency. But Peabody doesn't rule out Trump giving it a try nonetheless: \"We've already seen some-to put it lightly-unusual legal arguments from the Trump Administration.\"\n\n\"That's one [method],\" Trump told NBC when asked about potentially using Vice President J.D. Vance to achieve a third term. \"But there are others, too,\" he added without elaborating. \"There are others.\"\n\nBarring a new constitutional amendment, if Trump tries to run or serve again, it would be up to the courts to stop him.\n\nThe Supreme Court-with six of nine justices appointed by Republicans, including three by Trump-could rule in his favor, whether interpreting the 22nd Amendment, as some conservatives have proposed , to only apply to consecutive terms; acceding to the vice-presidential ascension loophole by brushing away 12th Amendment concerns; or otherwise.\n\nLaurence Tribe, professor emeritus of constitutional law at Harvard University and one of the country's leading experts on the Constitution, rules that possibility out. \"The court is extremely pro-Trump, but it's not insane,\" he tells TIME. \"This Court would vote nine to nothing that the 22nd Amendment is what it says and means what it was intended to mean.\"\n\nMichael Klarman, professor of legal history at Harvard University, is more cautious, given how the Supreme Court ruled on presidential immunity last year . \"Bad arguments can win in the Supreme Court when someone wants them to win badly enough,\" he says.\n\nThere's also the possibility that Trump could simply refuse to leave office in 2029, Constitution and courts be damned. Vance has already put forth the idea that the executive branch should simply ignore the judicial branch-a concept that runs counter to the republic's foundational separation of powers. And it's not like Trump didn't try to cling onto power after losing the 2020 election.\n\n\"There definitely are scenarios where he doesn't even need to embrace this kind of legalistic loophole strategy, and he just tries to hold onto power,\" says Peabody, \"because that's what people who like authority sometimes do.\"\n\nBut that path would likely require significant public support, something legal experts like Klarman and Tribe say is unlikely Trump, who would be 82 by 2029, will be able to maintain.\n\nTribe thinks there's little chance of Trump serving more than eight years, by any means: (\"Less than the likelihood of an asteroid hitting Singapore tomorrow morning,\" he says of the vice-presidential pathway.)\n\nSo why then does Trump bring it up so much? \"Holding up the third term possibility is a shiny object to distract public attention,\" Tribe says.\n\nWhat matters more, suggests Klarman, is what Trump does over the next four years. \"He can easily have gutted democracy in a way that it hardly matters whether he, Don Jr., Elon Musk (yes, there are ways around birthright citizenship as a requirement), or J.D. Vance is formally the President in 2029.\"\n\nCorrection, Feb. 14 An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Woodrow Wilson died during his second term. He had a stroke during his second term but didn't die until he was out of office.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Trump's Self-Inflicted Economic Wounds\n\nBivens is the chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute. His areas of research include macroeconomics, inequality, social insurance, public investment, and the economics of globalization.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 05, 2025, in New York City.\n\nBivens is the chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute. His areas of research include macroeconomics, inequality, social insurance, public investment, and the economics of globalization.\n\nT he U.S. economy is often compared to a cruise ship-it takes a lot of time and force to change its direction. This is why so many economists looked at the strong economy that was inherited by the Trump Administration and projected fast growth, low unemployment, declining inflation, and healthy stock market appreciation continuing for the next couple of years. But President Donald Trump's impact on the economy so far has been less a matter of turning the ship's rudder and more similar to a ship firing torpedoes at itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reversal in economic data since the Trump Administration took over has been historically rapid-and bad. The stock market is in near free fall . Interest rates are also falling, but for an undesirable reason: investors are assuming the Federal Reserve will need to swoop in soon to try to aggressively rescue a falling economy with future interest rate cuts. Unemployment insurance claims for federal workers have noticeably jumped even before the full force of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) layoffs have been recorded.\n\nOf course, economic data is reported retrospectively. But \" nowcasts ,\" short-term predictions which allow us to estimate the current and future states of the economy, indicate that growth in gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2025 is collapsing, with some prominent projections showing outright economic contraction . Of note: A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. Plus, measures of economic policy uncertainty are rivaling, or exceeding, what prevailed during the worst phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNone of these negative economic consequences were necessary, or even easy to make happen. It required a series of significant economic policy mistakes to make this scenario come to pass.\n\nMuch of the commentary around this stunning reversal of economic fortune focuses on Trump's tariff proposals . It is true that Trump's trade policy has involved chaotic shifts which threaten to destabilize the U.S. economy. But focusing only on his tariff policy misses other key policies that have been similarly damaging. Rather, the high-profile whipsaws on tariff policy have mostly made people realize that the misguided economic ideas championed during Trump's presidential campaign really might come to pass.\n\nTake the potentially illegal actions of Elon Musk's DOGE. While the precise impact of DOGE's cuts to the federal workforce is hard to predict, the plan to destroy the capacity of the federal government by any means possible was stated plain as day during Trump's campaign. Russell Vought, now director at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was a chief architect of Project 2025 , and in this role said : \"We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected... We want their funding to be shut down.\"\n\nNow it is clear that large-scale federal layoffs will likely have a short-run drag on economic growth . But even worse, the valuable services provided by federal agencies-which are often a needed input and infrastructure for private-sector activity-will wither and this degraded capacity will drag on growth for years to come. One key piece of evidence on how valuable these services are: When employees leave the federal government for the private sector, they tend to work fewer hours and earn significantly more in their new private-sector jobs. Trump's claim that many fired government employees \"don't work at all\" is quantifiably false. The federal workforce is an absolute bargain in terms of value provided, and there's nothing \"efficient\" about arbitrarily gutting it.\n\nThe Trump Administration's desire to enact mass deportations has yet to come to pass at scale. If it does, it is widely recognized that it would constitute a blow to the supply-side of the U.S. economy, depriving large swathes of U.S. business the labor force they rely on to produce goods and services. Mass deportations would cause enormous price spikes in the food and construction sectors. At least part of the recent softening of economic data surely represents business leaders starting to take these deportation threats literally and seriously.\n\nTrump's policy choices are also stifling investment in the economy, even among wealthy Americans -and for good reason. The policy landscape in front of business leaders who make investment decisions is tumultuous. Empirical measures of economic policy uncertainty are on par with what was seen during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, that moment in history can help us quantify how significantly Trump is negatively impacting the current economy.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, the economy performed decently. Though some may say his economic success from this term was also largely inherited, GDP grew and unemployment remained low. However, the economic success of Trump's first term abruptly ended after three years because of a pandemic that rocked the global economy.\n\nBut this time around, the second Trump Administration has ended a strong inherited trend of economic growth in just two months with a string of policy decisions so bad that might match the destructiveness of a once-in-a-century pandemic in the minds of consumers and business owners.\n\nThis outlook and uncertainty are why economic indicators have begun warning of an imminent growth collapse, as Trump proposed policies look set to deliver sharp negative shocks to both the demand ( Medicaid cuts and federal layoffs ) and supply-side ( deportations and tariffs ) of the economy. For instance, cutting Medicaid benefits would mean consumers would either forego needed health care or would have to give up some other purchases to keep receiving the same amount of care. And on the supply-side, tariffs push up costs for domestic consumers by design while deportations reduce available labor supply.\n\nAbsent a complete series of policy reversals, economists such as myself predict unfortunate consequences for the U.S. economy. Layoffs of federal employees and contractors are already causing spillover effects in the private-sector as well as among contractors and small businesses . The federal cutbacks will hit the D.C. area hardest, but almost 80% of federal workers do not work in the D.C. metro area-they are spread over every state and congressional district in the country. As a result, unemployment rates will likely rise over the coming months. The stock market declines may also lead to cutbacks in consumer spending . Plus, the trade war could stunt export growth and raise prices for consumers. Potential Medicaid cuts could also force closures of rural hospitals and squash spending on other goods and services as recipients have to dig deeper into their own pockets to buy needed health care. Deportations will likely lead to spiking prices for food and housing.\n\nIn short, the Trump Administration has started down a path of determined de-growth for the U.S. economy. There is still time to avoid a deeply damaging period of economic distress-but it needs to happen soon.\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "What to Know About John Roberts, the Chief Justice Challenging Trump\n\nReporter\n\nReporter\n\nI n July 2024, Chief Justice John Roberts penned one of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions of President Donald Trump's political career. In a 6-3 ruling along ideological lines , Roberts and the court's conservative majority established that Presidents can enjoy broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts-a decision that provided Trump with a crucial legal shield as he campaigned to return to the White House. The ruling effectively delayed one of Trump's most serious criminal cases related to his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, contributing to the political landscape that allowed his re-election bid to thrive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut on Tuesday, after weeks of silence, Roberts took a markedly different stance. In a rare move, he issued a public statement pushing back against Trump's escalating attacks on federal judges who have ruled against his Administration-just hours after Trump called for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg over a ruling blocking a key deportation policy.\n\n\"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" Roberts wrote, according to the Associated Press. His words, measured but firm, represented a striking contrast to his previous willingness to bolster Trump's legal arguments.\n\nThe moment highlighted the complex and sometimes contradictory role Roberts has played in Trump's political and legal battles. As the leader of the judiciary, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush in 2005, he has, at times, enabled Trump's expansive claims of presidential power. Yet, as Trump's attacks on judges have grown more incendiary, Roberts appears increasingly compelled to push back.\n\nHere's what to know about Chief Justice John Roberts and his complicated relationship with President Donald Trump:\n\nRoberts' tenure as Chief Justice has coincided with some of the most tumultuous legal battles involving a sitting President. Despite his reputation as an institutionalist committed to preserving the court's legitimacy, Roberts has frequently authored or joined opinions that benefited Trump's political and legal standing.\n\nIn 2018, he cast the decisive vote in upholding Trump's controversial travel ban on several majority-Muslim countries. More recently, in March 2024, his court issued a unanimous decision blocking state-level efforts to bar Trump from the ballot under the Constitution's insurrection clause-a ruling that secured Trump's path to renomination.\n\nBut no decision was more consequential than last year's ruling on presidential immunity. By siding with Trump's argument that former Presidents cannot be criminally prosecuted for official acts, Roberts' court delayed legal proceedings that could have put Trump on trial before the 2024 election. The decision drew sharp criticism from legal experts who warned that it effectively placed the presidency above the law, granting future occupants of the office unprecedented protection from accountability.\n\nTrump, for his part, appeared to recognize the significance of the ruling. As he exited a joint session of Congress earlier this month, cameras captured him warmly thanking Roberts. \"Thank you again. Won't forget it,\" the President said. While Trump later insisted on his social media platform, Truth Social , that he was referring to Roberts' role in swearing him in as President, the moment fueled speculation that the President saw Roberts as an ally in his legal battles.\n\nRead More : Will the Supreme Court Preserve the Rule of Law?\n\nDespite his past decisions aiding Trump's legal defenses, Roberts has also taken pains to push back when Trump directly undermines the judiciary's independence. His statement on Tuesday was not the first time he has publicly criticized Trump for attacking judges.\n\nIn 2018, after Trump dismissed a federal judge as an \"Obama judge\" following a ruling against his asylum policy, Roberts issued an uncharacteristically direct response . \"We do not have 'Obama judges' or 'Trump judges,' 'Bush judges' or 'Clinton judges.' What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,\" he said at the time.\n\nTrump dismissed Roberts' latest statement on Tuesday night during a Fox News interview . \"He didn't mention my name in his statement,\" Trump said of Roberts, suggesting that he could have been referring to other people who have called for Judge Boasberg to be impeached. Prior to Roberts' intervention, Trump called Boasberg \"a Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama,\" after he blocked his Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants.\n\nRead More : John Roberts Named on TIME100's Most Influential People of 2020 List\n\nAs Trump's presidency unfolds, the courts remain one of the few institutions capable of checking his expansive use of executive power. Since taking office again in January, Trump has pushed an aggressive legal agenda that has triggered a flurry of lawsuits. His Administration's frequent losses in lower courts have seemingly fueled Trump's attacks on the judiciary, with some conservative allies in Congress introducing articles of impeachment against multiple judges, including Boasberg. Impeaching a judge would require 67 votes in the Senate, which means Republicans and Democrats would both have to support it.\n\nRoberts, as the head of the federal judiciary, has been facing mounting pressure to protect the courts from political interference. With a lifetime appointment, it remains to be seen whether the 70-year-old Chief Justice will take further steps to defend judicial independence as Trump continues his broadsides against the judiciary.\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

      "text": "Donald Trump's Suite of Power\n\nTrump International Hotel is the epicenter of the President's business interests in D.C.\n\nHow the President's D.C. outpost became a dealmaker's paradise for diplomats, lobbyists and insiders\n\nBy ALEX ALTMAN Photographs by CHRISTOPHER MORRIS -VII for TIME\n\nAt the bar of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, you can order a crystal spoonful of Hungarian wine for $140. Cocktails run from $23 for a gin and tonic to $100 for a vodka concoction with raw oysters and caviar. There's a seafood pyramid called \"the Trump Tower\" that costs $120, or you can hit BLT Prime, a restaurant where the $59 salt-aged Kansas City strip steak comes with a long-shot chance of seeing the President sitting nearby. It's the only restaurant in town where he has dined.\n\nIf the urge to shop strikes, there's a Brioni boutique in one corner that offers the same Italian suits the President favors, starting at a few thousand a pop. Downstairs, a 90-minute couples massage at the Spa by Ivanka Trump will set you back $460-roughly the rack rate for a recent night in a standard room, where the Trump brand adorns everything from the shampoo bottles to the wine in the minibar.\n\nPeople pay these prices for more than just booze, caviar and back rubs. This is the new town square in Donald Trump's Washington. Tourists perch on the blue velvet sofas in the lobby, snapping cell-phone pictures as power players stream across the dark marble floors and cream carpets: international business­men, Republican operatives, wealthy donors, foreign diplomats, former Trump campaign aides, the occasional Administration official.\n\nGuests can order pricey cocktails and mingle with Washington power brokers at Benjamin's Bar & Lounge in the hotel.\n\nThat's partly because a President who once promised to \"drain the swamp\" of influence peddling now owns the city's newest bog. According to Trump's 2016 financial-disclosure statement, he owned a 76.7% stake in the limited-liability company that controls the hotel, which is now headed by his son Donald Jr. The place has been a magnet for the capital's political class. \"Of course we hang out there,\" says a former Trump campaign adviser. \"Everyone hangs out there. Being in the Trump hotel's lobby is a way to get people to know you.\"\n\nThe potential conflicts of interest are dizzying. In the soaring atrium, guests kibitz under a massive U.S. flag-a gift on loan from the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that helps shape Administration policy and that thanked top donors by bankrolling a December gala here keynoted by then incoming Vice President Mike Pence. For Trump's Inauguration, guests willing to fork over the steep fees could mingle with top federal officials. One VIP package, which offered lodging in a 6,300-sq.-ft. townhouse suite-two floors overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, accessed through a discreet wooden door-was advertised for $500,000. The President invited members of Congress to lunch in the ballroom. \"It's an absolutely stunning hotel,\" press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Jan. 19. \"I encourage you to go there if you haven't been by.\"\n\nForeign governments seem particu­larly keen to patronize Trump's property. Between Oct. 1 and March 31, lobbyists working on behalf of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ran up a $270,000 tab on rooms, catering and parking, according to foreign lobbying disclosures filed at the end of May and first reported by the Daily Caller. That stretch coincided with a Saudi lobbying push against legislation that would allow victims of terrorist attacks to sue foreign governments. In May, Trump chose Riyadh as his first foreign stop as President, where he announced an arms deal, gave a major foreign policy speech and participated in a traditional ceremonial sword dance.\n\nIn December, diplomats from Bahrain shifted that country's National Day festivities to Trump International's gilded, 13,000-sq.-ft. presidential ballroom. As if on cue, Kuwait moved its own annual gala in February from the Four Seasons across town to Trump International-even though the former location had already been reserved. The embassy of Azerbaijan co-hosted a Hanukkah party in the hotel's elegant Lincoln Library, with a roster of guests that included Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who has become notorious this spring for meeting with several Trump Administration officials. \"You know, successful people own things,\" Azerbaijani Ambassador Elin Suleymanov tells TIME. \"That is a natural thing.\"\n\nThe Old Post Office Pavilion is the second tallest building in D.C., after the Washington Monument.\n\nOne longtime Republican power broker summed up the role the hotel is playing in Trump's Washington: \"It is a magnet for unsophisticated foreign governments and companies to offer tribute. It does not work, but it is perceived as a path to influence.\"\n\nYet domestic groups have found reasons to do business there as well. Last year, evangelist Franklin Graham planned a global conference on Christian persecution at the Mayflower Hotel for this May. Two months after Trump was inaugurated, Graham decided to add a closing banquet at Trump International, where he also reserved rooms for select guests, which meant ferrying them between hotels in a fleet of black SUVs. Among the guests was a delegation from Moscow headed by Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev, a top cleric of the Russian Orthodox Church and a close ally of Vladimir Putin, who met during the conference with Pence. A spokesperson for Graham said neither the Mayflower nor a nearby Hilton could accommodate the banquet, and up to 40 rooms came as part of the package.\n\nNot everyone found the fancy digs necessary. \"We didn't have to stay there,\" Ignatius Aphrem II, patriarch of the Syrian Orthodox Church in Damascus, told TIME. Speaking of Graham's organization, he added, \"Maybe they have special arrangements. Maybe they are friends of the President.\"\n\nIn the past, Presidents have often gone to great lengths to assure the public that they aren't mixing the nation's business with their own. Many of Trump's predecessors voluntarily divested their business assets or placed them in a blind trust administered by an independent third party, to avoid both conflicts of interest and the appearance of them. Trump has taken a different approach. He has stepped away from the operations of his business, but he has not relinquished ownership. Critics say the approach falls far short. \"He is one great big example of exploiting public office for private gain,\" says Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who trains governments around the world in ethics and anti­corruption practices. \"Of course it's a scandal.\"\n\nWhich doesn't mean it's illegal. Trump does not seem bothered by the appearance of conflicts, often doing his public business in his private holdings. During the campaign, Trump visited his properties across the U.S. as well as his golf courses in Scotland. He used televised campaign events to promote Trump products, including bottled water and wine. As President, he decamps on many weekends for his golf courses in Virginia and New Jersey, trips that guarantee free publicity from the press corps. He took Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping on separate trips to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, where the club entry fee doubled after his election, to $200,000.\n\nTrump denies any impropriety. \"The law's totally on my side,\" he said in November. \"The President can't have a conflict of interest.\" Or rather, as his lawyers point out, as President he is not subject to federal conflict-of-interest laws, which offer broad latitude for the Commander in Chief. And his sprawling business empire was front and center on the campaign trail, with aides highlighting a track rec­ord of delivering projects under budget and ahead of schedule.\n\nTo address concerns, Trump announced in January that he would hand control of his business empire to his two adult sons and a trustee, halt all new foreign deals, terminate some pending ones and wall himself off from company decisions. Because the emoluments clause of the Constitution bans most transactions between government officials and foreign governments, the Trump Organization pledged to donate its profits from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury. \"President-­elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built,\" said his lawyer Sheri Dillon. \"This plan offers a suitable alternative to address the concerns of the American people.\"\n\nThe firewall between the Trump presidency and the Trump Organization has turned out to be less than airtight. His sons have participated in political meetings and are sought-after speakers at ­Republican functions across the U.S. Eric Trump's wife Lara is employed by the digital firm working for Trump's re-election campaign. Meanwhile, the company, according to internal documents released in May by Democrats in Congress, has since determined that it is not practical to segregate all foreign sources of income, arguing that such an effort would not \"even be possible without an inordinate amount of time, resources and specialists.\" The donation will be made on an annual basis at the end of each calendar year, according to a Trump Organization spokesperson. It's unclear who would ensure that the company complies with its pledge.\n\nIn response to the unusual arrangements, multiple groups have filed civil lawsuits against Trump, aiming to force the courts to step in. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a progressive watchdog group, filed suit alleging that he has violated the Constitution by accepting emoluments. Cork Wine Bar, a D.C. restaurant, filed another suit that claims Trump's stake in the hotel's restaurants gives it an unfair competitive advantage in the city's fine-dining market. House and Senate Democrats are also planning to sue Trump to stop emoluments violations, according to Politico, arguing that he is breaking the law by continuing to profit from his businesses while serving as President.\n\nLuxury SUVs line up outside of the hotel's presidential ballroom.\n\nThe story of Trump and the Old Post Office Pavilion is a tale of grand ambition, outsize promises and a complex deal that left a trail of criticism. Built in the 1890s, it is the capital's second tallest structure, a landmark of gray granite and steel girders with a glass atrium and an iconic clock tower that overlooks Pennsylvania Avenue and the Mall. Over the years, it had become an aging orphan nobody wanted, scheduled for demolition several times over the past century, only to be spared by preservationists.\n\nWith a nudge from Congress, the General Services Administration (GSA), began soliciting bids in 2011 from private companies looking to redevelop the building. Trump put together an appealing proposal, promising to pump some $200 million into a renovation and partnering with a venerable D.C. architect who had worked for years to save the building. Trump lined up financing from Colony Capital, a major developer run by his close friend and future inaugural committee chairman, Tom Barrack. And he promised to pay the federal government $3 million annually in rent for 60 years. GSA picked Trump from a crowded group of bidders, including such hotel chains as Hilton and Hyatt.\n\nThe promises began to unravel. The architect, Arthur Cotton Moore, dropped off the project. The financing partner fell through. Once work got under way, the Trumps quietly reneged on commitments to preserve historic features, from the lighting scheme to the wall trim, according to a person closely involved. The Trump Organization denies that charge. \"Throughout the revival process and restoration of this iconic asset, we worked tirelessly to maintain the integrity and storied history of the original landmark building,\" said a spokesperson for the organization. \"We worked meticulously with the GSA and a team of consultants on the historic preservation and are incredibly proud of the extreme attention to detail that we paid.\"\n\nA projection by artist Robin Bell on the facade of the hotel on May 15. Liz Gorman/Robin Bell\n\nBut the biggest complication was still to come. The 263-room hotel opened in the fall of 2016. A few weeks later, Trump won the White House, making him, if somewhat indirectly, both landlord and tenant of a valuable government property. His contract with GSA, the federal agency that administers the lease, explicitly forbids elected officials from being admitted to \"any share or part of this lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\"\n\nAnd so, shortly after the election, congressional Democrats summoned a GSA official for a briefing about how it would handle the situation. During the meeting in the Rayburn Building on Capitol Hill, the GSA official said the agency had concluded that Trump would be in breach of contract upon Inauguration, according to a letter signed by four House Democrats and confirmed by two other people present.\n\nBut when Trump took office, the GSA went mum on the matter. On March 23, Kevin Terry, the GSA contracting officer responsible for the deal with Trump, clarified the agency's position, declaring the President to be in \"full compliance\" with the lease. There is no evidence Trump or anyone in his Administration pressed GSA about the arrangement. But critics say the fact that the President has the power to appoint and remove the head of the agency may have influenced the move. And while members of Congress have pressed GSA for more information about the decision, it lacks the power to reverse it. (Terry referred questions to a GSA press representative, who declined an interview, asked that TIME supply written questions and then never responded to them.)\n\nIn the beginning, business at the hotel was sluggish. During its first two months of operation, September and October 2016, Trump International lost more than $1.1 million, according to a letter from a group of House Democrats to the acting GSA administrator. But such struggles faded after the election. At happy hour, the lobby bar fills with guests nibbling charcuterie and sipping Trump-branded rosé beneath flat screens tuned to Fox News. Patricia Tang, director of sales and marketing, said the hotel's ownership hasn't affected its bottom line. \"The whole situation has been neutral,\" says Tang, an industry veteran. \"You win, you lose. The result is we're doing fine.\"\n\nIn late May, Tang took TIME on a tour of the hotel's gilded spaces, from the townhouse suite-replete with a gym and private dining room-to the ballroom where workmen were breaking down the remnants of a wedding. Privacy is part of the package, she noted. There are no public boards listing the day's conclaves, and there are separate entrances for VIPs. As a policy, the hotel doesn't reveal who has held events or booked accommodations.\n\nOf course, governments looking to pay tribute to the American President need not come to Washington to do it. According to his financial disclosure report, the President appears to own or control more than 500 businesses in countries ranging from India to Indonesia. \"The hotel,\" says Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as President George W. Bush's ethics lawyer and is part of the CREW lawsuit, \"is really just a tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nSome of the President's foreign holdings are in countries that may test the lines between his business interests and his role as Commander in Chief. Trump licensed his name to a 57-story luxury residential tower in Manila, set to open later this year. The head of the company that built it has been named a special trade envoy to the U.S. by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. In the President's flagship building on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, one of the biggest tenants is a state-owned Chinese bank, whose lease is up for renewal in 2019. Last year, after Trump made incendiary comments about Muslims on the campaign trail, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for Trump's name to be stripped from a pair of towers in Istanbul's business district. Erdogan later backed off, and Trump has since praised his counterpart despite the autocrat's crackdown on dissidents and democratic institutions. According to his financial disclosure report, Trump earned up to $5 million from the project. \"I have a little conflict of interest,\" Trump told his future White House strategist Stephen Bannon during a 2015 radio interview, \" 'cause I have a major, major building in Istanbul.\"\n\nAs its hotel in Washington flourishes, the Trump Organization is working to find new ways to extend the brand. On June 5, it unveiled a new midscale hotel chain, under the patriotic name of American Idea. It plans to debut it in Mississippi. The target demographic includes some of the same voters who lifted the President into the White House.\n\n-With reporting by Tessa Berenson, Elizabeth Dias, Haley Edwards, Philip Elliott and Zeke J. Miller/­Washington □\n\nThe heart of the hotel is a nine-story atrium under a skylight.\n\nYour browser is out of date. Please update your browser at http://update.microsoft.com"

      "text": "Donald Trump Photographs: Behind Greatest Portraits\n\nIt's an unprecedented match-up of familiar faces. The major-party presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have spent decades in the public eye as key figures of American culture. Their portraits have covered magazines, newspapers and websites.\n\nWe asked some of the greatest portrait shooters who have photographed Donald Trump to scour their archives and select their favorite photographs from these one-on-one sessions.\n\nHere are the stories, told by the photographers, behind these iconic portraits. -Tara Johnson, Chelsea Matiash and Paul Moakley.\n\nWilliam Coupon , portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for Manhattan,inc. in 1983: \"I shot Donald Trump twice. This is my favorite. Trump was offering his services as a 'peace negotiator' between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We thought: get the bird, which proceeded to leave droppings behind. Trump was amenable enough, but not at all happy. But ultimately, it was that something in his eyes. His eyes. Not the bird's.\"\n\nMichael O'Neill , portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for the New York Times Magazine in 1984: \"1984 - in many ways. Gilt, gold, pride... He loved the cover! It was his first for the New York Times Magazine .\"\n\nHarry Benson , photojournalist, who shot Trump in Atlantic City, N.J. for People in 1990: \"Shortly after the Taj Mahal opened in Atlantic City in 1990, I was there to photograph Donald Trump. He told me there was over a million dollars in the 'cage' in the casino where the money is kept. I told him I had never seen a million dollars. Donald proceeded to walk right in and pick up exactly a million dollars to hold for the photograph which caused quite a stir as it was totally against the rules of the casino. When some of the money started to fall off his lap, I found it was the most interesting photograph of the day.\"\n\nMax Vadukul , portrait photographer, who shot Trump at Mar-a Largo, Fla., for The New Yorker on May 19, 1997: \"This is one of many 'air' shots I did with Mr. Trump. There is a lot going in this image, it's complicated, sophisticated and strong in its power. I had shown Mr. Trump exactly what I wanted and he had that look that says, 'Oh I can do better than that.' And after just one effort - because it's a big effort physically to do this for 12 frames - he totally nailed it and went even further. What I like about this image, which is now an iconic shot, is the attitude, the elegance, the confidence. Of course, I did not know him at all at that time, but the personality came thru and today he is running for President. This image says a lot.\"\n\nTomo Muscionico , photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for Spiegel in September 1999: \"Looking back, I think it's a powerful portrait of a mogul whose body language shows his privilege, sexuality and arrogance. This subtle moment with him in a limousine says it all.\"\n\nPlaton , photographer, who shot Trump in New York for Fortune on August 21, 2003: \"I photographed Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan. It was a cathedral of gaudy, post-modern excess. I asked him to look straight into the camera, trying to get his head as symmetrical as possible. With a glint in his eye, he looked at me and said, 'No - this is my best side.' He turned to his right cheek, as if to present me with Trump Inc. on his terms. I thought about this moment many times since the picture, and for me, it says something fascinating about the character of this extraordinary, disrupting figure. For me, he understands the media. He's comfortable within his own skin. He's happy to play with the process of photography and film, and consequently is able to project his own brand of authenticity. I believe he has singlehandedly transformed the political and media landscape this year. Our presidential election has essentially been turned into a reality TV show. All media pundits and political opponents have been forced to play on Donald's terms.\"\n\nAndres Serrano , photographer, who shot Trump in 2004 for the series America : \"Shortly after Sept. 11, I started a series called America . I felt America had been attacked as the 'enemy' and I wanted to show who the 'enemy' was. I took over a hundred portraits of people from all walks of life over a three-year period. Donald Trump's portrait, taken in 2004, was the last one taken.\"\n\nChris Buck , photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for Philadelphia Magazine on March 29, 2006: \"Once we finished with the required set-ups that my client needed I brought out an 11×14\" print from a previous shoot that Donald Trump and I had done together. He asked, 'What is this?' I said, 'I'm giving you this print as a gift-to buy an extra set-up from you.' He shrugged and said, 'Okay,' and this is how I got him to pose for this picture. It's shot in the conference room for Trump's real estate business. With Trump now running for president I get a lot of comments on this photograph. Most people see 'the many faces of Donald Trump,' but I see it more as 'the broken man,' which may well be more a reflection of my state of mind, not his, as is the case for most of my portraits - they're about my discomfort, not the sitter's.\"\n\nMarco Grob , portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for TIME on April 5, 2011: \"I'm interested in faces beyond their genetics. I've spent a lifetime wondering why we wear the faces we have. Why do people desire power? What are their motives? Can you see these motives in their faces? Or in their gestures? What about their body language? I've met many people of power, and I don't attempt to provide the answer, but I strive to provide the question. I often wonder who else asks these questions? This frame really spoke to me as one where Trump was trying to connect with me behind the camera. That being said, his connection was ice cold, he was all business.\"\n\nPeter Yang , photographer, who shot Trump in New York for Rolling Stone in 2011: \"When I was commissioned to photograph Donald Trump in 2011, the first thing that came to mind was this gold-plated tree stump I'd been eyeing at a ritzy furniture store down the street from me. I had been to Trump's house before (to photograph Melania Trump) and noted the bevy of things gold. Gold leafing on all the walls, a gold front door, even a golden toilet. With the log in mind, the idea of Trump being the Thinker came next, and while I loved the idea, I was pretty sure he would nix it.\n\nOn the day of the shoot, I was told to work fast, real fast. His people said I had 10 minutes, which usually meant 5-7 before you're getting that thanks-and-goodbye handshake. Arnold Schwarzenegger once gave me one of those handshakes after 40 seconds or so. \"That's what I like about you\", he said, \"you're quick.\"\n\nI had three setups ready to go when Mr. Trump got there. There were two safe shots, then the Thinker. The first shot was Trump in front of the Manhattan skyline. Pretty standard stuff and it only took a minute. Trump was way more understated than I imagined he'd be, almost soft spoken. I'd mostly seen him firing people on The Apprentice , and I was glad I didn't get that guy. The second shot was a close-up portrait of him. It's always interesting to see famous folks up close, and when he, unprompted, pointed and yelled into the camera, I knew I got the shot.\n\nWe then walked over to the gold log. I took a deep breath and showed him a picture of the Thinker. Before I could say anything, he grabbed the paper out of my hand, studied it for a moment, and hit his mark on the log. I snapped a few frames, he shook my hand, and was quickly out the door.\"\n\nMartin Schoeller , photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for TIME in August 2015: \"I wanted to play on this idea that he thinks of himself as a great leader and savior of the American people. I thought what could be better than our national bird. It's the perfect symbol. Having worked with birds of prey in the past, I knew that it wouldn't be easy and there would be a lot of room for surprise. I thought those two attitudes colliding was the perfect match.\"\n\nNigel Parry , portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York for Esquire in November 2015: \"After being unable to fulfill the brief due to Mr. Trump insisting that I couldn't photograph his profile, I decided the only route was a confrontational photograph for a confrontational subject. I think this photo fits the bill.\"\n\nRead the Stories Behind the Best Portraits of Hillary Clinton\n\nFollow TIME LightBox on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\n\nYour browser is out of date.

      "text": "Donald Trump\n\nT hree days before Thanksgiving, the former and future President of the United States is sitting in the sun-filled dining room of his Florida home and private club. In the lavish reception area, more than a dozen people have been waiting for nearly two hours for Donald Trump to emerge. His picks for ­National Security Adviser, special envoy to the Middle East, Vice President, and chief of staff huddle nearby. All afternoon, Trump pipes music throughout the 1927 oceanfront estate from a 2,000-song playlist he curates: Sinéad O'Connor's \"Nothing Compares 2 U,\" ABBA's \"The Winner Takes It All,\" James Brown's \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World.\"\n\nFor 97 years, the editors of TIME have been picking the Person of the Year : the individual who, for better or for worse, did the most to shape the world and the headlines over the past 12 months. In many years, that choice is a difficult one. In 2024, it was not.\n\nSince he began running for President in 2015, perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history than Trump. He shocked many by winning the White House in 2016 , then led the U.S. through a chaotic term that included the first year of a pandemic as well as a period of nationwide protest, and that ended with his losing the election by 7 million votes and provoking the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The smart money wagered that we had witnessed the end of Trump.\n\nIf that moment marked Trump's nadir, today we are witnessing his apotheosis. On the cusp of his second presidency , all of us-from his most fanatical supporters to his most fervent critics-are living in the Age of Trump. He dispatched his Republican rivals in near record time. For weeks, he campaigned largely from the New York ­courtroom where he would be convicted on 34 felony counts. His sole debate with President Joe Biden in June led to his opponent's eventual exit from the race. Sixteen days later, he survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally. In the sprint that followed, he outlasted Vice President Kamala Harris , sweeping all seven swing states and emerging from the election at the height of his popularity. \"Look what happened,\" Trump told his supporters in his election-­night victory speech. \"Isn't this crazy?\" He almost couldn't believe it himself.\n\nTrump has remade American politics in the process. He won by enlarging his base, seizing the frustration over rising prices and benefiting from a global turn against incumbents. With those tailwinds, exit polls suggest that he won the largest percentage of Black Americans for a Republican since Gerald Ford and the most Latino voters of any GOP nominee since George W. Bush. ­Suburban women, whose anger over restrictions to reproductive rights was thought to be a ­bulwark for the Democrats, moved not away but toward him. He became the first Republican in 20 years to win more votes than the Democrat, with 9 of 10 American counties increasing their support for Trump from 2020.\n\nNow we watch as members of Congress, international institutions, and global leaders once again align themselves with his whims. The carousel of Trumpworld characters spins anew. This time, we think we know what to expect. Supporters cheer even his promises to take revenge on his enemies and dismantle the government. In a matter of weeks, Trump will be returning to the Oval Office with his intentions clear: tariff imports, deport millions, and threaten the press. Put RFK Jr. in charge of vaccines . Chance war with Iran. \"Anything can happen,\" he told us.\n\nSitting with TIME three weeks after the election, Trump was more subdued than when we visited him at Mar-a-Lago in March. He is happiest to be in a fight, and now that he has won, he sounded almost wistful, recognizing that he had run for office for the final time. \"It's sad in a way. It will never ­happen again,\" Trump told us. And while he is thinking about how that chapter has ended, for Americans and for the world, it is also the beginning of a new one. Trump is once again at the center of the world, and in as strong a position as he has ever been.\n\nOver time, we've seen the Person of the Year franchise shift: from Man of the Year to its current designation; from the period between the world wars, defined by leaders like Mohandas Gandhi and Wallis ­Simpson, to the first quarter of the 21st century, an era marked by the tremendous changes ushered in by a technological revolution. ­Although the ­American presidency has evolved across these eras, its influence has not diminished. Today, we are witnessing a resurgence of populism, a widening mistrust in the institutions that defined the last century, and an eroding faith that liberal values will lead to better lives for most people. Trump is both agent and beneficiary of it all. For marshaling a comeback of historic proportions, for driving a once-in-a-­generation political realignment, for reshaping the American presidency and altering America's role in the world, Donald Trump is TIME's 2024 ­Person of the Year .\n\nWrite to Sam Jacobs at sam.jacobs@time.com"

      "text": "'My Whole Life Is a Bet.' Inside President Trump's Gamble on an Untested Re-Election Strategy\n\n'My whole life is a bet,' the President of the United States says, resting his forearms on the edge of the Resolute desk in the Oval Office.\n\nIt's a steamy evening in mid-June, and Trump is facing a set of high-stakes tests around the world. Tensions rising with Iran . Tariffs imposed by India. Protesters flooding the streets of Hong Kong . But Trump is confident, ready to joust. He has invited a group of TIME journalists for an interview, blown past the allotted time and settled in for a wide-ranging discussion. Along the way, he orders a Diet Coke with ice with the push of a small red button set into a wooden box on the desk, and directs an aide to fetch a copy of a hand-delivered birthday letter sent from Kim Jong Un.\n\nPolitics is rarely out of mind for any man who wills his way into this rarefied sanctum. Especially not one who calls his campaign manager on many days by 7 a.m., and certainly not now, the day before Trump formally kicks off his 2020 re-election bid . So it doesn't take much prodding for the President, a former casino magnate, to start making book on the sprawling field of Democratic challengers.\n\nA \"progressive\" will probably win the primary, Trump predicts, running down the competition with evident relish. Joe Biden \"is not the same Biden,\" he says, adding later, \"Where's the magic?\" Kamala Harris, he notes, \"has not surged.\" Bernie Sanders is \"going in the wrong direction.\" Elizabeth Warren's \"doing pretty well,\" he allows, but Pete Buttigieg \"never\" had a chance.\n\nWhy? \"I just don't feel it,\" Trump says. \"Politics is all instinct.\"\n\nOnce again, Trump is putting his own instincts at the center of his campaign. The political mercenaries who tried to discipline his impulses in 2016 have been shown the door. The 2020 campaign is unmistakably Trump's show. \"We all have our meetings,\" the President says. \"But I generally do my own thing.\" Campaign staff have been hired to follow Trump's lead, and the President has made it known that when he tweets a new policy or improvises an attack at a rally, everyone had better be ready to follow along. \"He blows the hole and everyone runs into the breach,\" says an aide.\n\nGone is the rickety operation that eked out an upset victory over Hillary Clinton. In its place, advisers boast, is a state-of-the-art campaign befitting an incumbent President. Trump's campaign is gearing up to spend $1 billion, and may well get there. His team has spent more money, earlier in the campaign, than any re-election bid in recent history. Campaign staff sit in slick offices in a glass-skinned tower overlooking the Potomac River in Arlington, Va. And Trump has won total control of the Republican National Committee, which fought against him for much of 2016.\n\nDespite the trappings of convention, however, Trump has for the most part thrown out the playbook for incumbency. The last three two-term Presidents were lifted in important ways by a bipartisan message. Bill Clinton ran on the 1994 crime bill and tax reform. George W. Bush ran on keeping America safe in the wake of 9/11. Barack Obama reminded voters that Osama bin Laden was dead and General Motors was alive.\n\nTrump, who lost the popular vote in 2016 and is the only President in the history of Gallup polling never to crack 50% approval, says he's ready to defy that legacy. \"I think my base is so strong, I'm not sure that I have to do that,\" he tells TIME, after being asked whether he should reach out to swing voters. The mantra of Trump 2020 is \"turnout, turnout, turnout,\" as campaign manager Brad Parscale puts it. \"People all think you have to change people's minds. You have to get people to show up that believe in you.\"\n\nInsiders know it's a tough path. In 2016, Trump flipped three Democratic bastions-Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin-by a combined 79,646 votes, capitalizing on Hillary Clinton's liabilities and energizing disaffected voters. Trump drew an \"inside straight,\" says his 2016 campaign chief executive Steve Bannon. He can't count on that luck in 2020. \"You have to get every f-cking deplorable,\" Bannon says, using his own Clinton-inspired term for Trump's ardent supporters. \"Everybody's got to show up.\"\n\nThe key is making Trump's instinct for America's sore spots the engine of a political machine designed to inflame supporters. At its core, his campaign is a kind of a perpetual outrage machine. It uses algorithms-automated settings on Internet platforms like Google and Facebook-to place massive digital ad buys anytime Trump creates a firestorm. The cycle is simple: Trump says something controversial or offensive; that drives a surge of search interest in the topic; and that gives his campaign an opening to serve up online ads. The ads encourage supporters to text the campaign, take single-question campaign-generated polls, and buy Trump hats, yard signs, beer coolers and WITCH HUNT decals from the campaign online store, all of which rakes in voter contact data.\n\nNever before has an incumbent President run a campaign this way. \"It is a strategy built for the new partisan era,\" says Princeton University presidential historian Julian Zelizer. \"Candidates are always doing things to turn out their supporters. What has not been tested, at least in modern times, is a strategy in which all the rhetoric and all the policy is just tailored around the turnout crowd and there is no effort to go beyond it.\"\n\nWhich brings us to the wager on which the gambler has staked a second term. Trump has already smashed the norms of American politics, remade the Republican Party into his cheering gallery and taken the national news cycle hostage. Can he win a second term on the basis that's he's governed in the first, by playing to his base?\n\nNowhere has the machine adapted to the President as it has in the Oval Office. Over the course of TIME's 57-minute interview, the case for Trump's re-election unspools through a series of set-piece requests made to his assistants. Pressed over his commitment to get the U.S. out of foreign wars, he has a ready reply. \"We defeated ISIS,\" he says. \"Maybe you could ask somebody to bring me those maps,\" he adds, speaking to one of his staff. Soon enough, an aide brings in three printed sheets showing the Islamic State-held territory in Syria shrinking to zero.\n\nWhen asked whether the latest attacks against oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, which U.S. officials blame on Iran, threaten to draw America toward a new, dangerous intervention in the Middle East, he requests favorable data once more. \"Do me a favor, will you get the information I had yesterday?\" he says to an aide in the next room. \"The companies, the countries that benefit from the strait? I want to show you something. China gets 60% of their oil there. Japan gets 25% of their oil. We get very little.\"\n\nOf course, ISIS continues to launch attacks. \"We've taken back the caliphate,\" Trump says. \"That doesn't mean one of the crazies doesn't walk into a store all bombed up.\" And it's not impossible to imagine the world economy or the Middle East descending into chaos if Trump fulfills his wish \"to get out\" of the region. Even as he downplays Iran's alleged attack as \"very minor,\" his outgoing Acting Secretary of Defense announced a deployment of 1,000 more U.S. troops to the Gulf to bolster U.S. installations against what the Pentagon calls an escalation of threats from Iran.\n\nThe core of Trump's pitch - to voters as well as visiting journalists-is that there's been great progress around the world on his watch. The collapse of Chinese trade talks - and a mounting tariff fight that the Oxford Economics research firm says will shave 0.3% off GDP in 2020 and potentially cost the economy $62 billion in lost output over the next year-is not a failure, it's a success, he claims. \"I give them a lot of credit, but we've helped create China. You look at what's happened over the last period of time, and China wants to make a deal,\" he says. \"I'm very happy now collecting 25% on $250 billion, which is what we're doing.\" Few trade experts see Trump gaining the upper hand in his tariff battle, but in his telling, multiple countries are looking to make deals with the U.S., thanks to his unconventional approach. He lists some, only off the record, again calling for a document that provides rather weak support.\n\nEventually, Trump just cuts to the chase. \"Look, I think I've done so much-could you bring me the list of things, please, give me four of them,\" he shouts through the door. \"I've done more in 21⁄2 years than any President in the history of this country.\" Three printed pages with 72 bullet points emerge: Economic growth is up, and unemployment has stayed at or below 4% for 15 months. He signed tax cuts into law, opened up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, canceled the Clean Power Plan, withdrew from the Iran deal and the Paris Agreement, issued an order to make a space force the sixth branch of the military. He's aggrieved by the perception that he doesn't get credit for what he's done.\n\nThe Oval Office isn't the natural venue for Trump's brand of politics. Campaigning is where he really feels at home. So Trump has merged the two to an unprecedented degree - filing for re-election on the first day of his presidency, naming a 2020 campaign manager just a year into his first term and banking at least $100 million for the effort so far. In June, an independent government agency found that senior White House adviser Kelly-anne Conway had violated a law prohibiting federal employees from engaging in partisan politics by repeatedly slamming Trump's 2020 opponents in media interviews and on Twitter. (\"Let me know when the jail sentence starts,\" Conway scoffed in May.) Even as Trump sat with TIME, his Administration was tossing red meat out the back of the campaign wagon in the form of a pledge to deport \"millions of illegal aliens\" in the country.\n\nThe nerve center of the re-election bid isn't Trump Tower, where campaign mail arrives and Eric and Lara Trump have studios for television hits, or even the Arlington office tower. The node closest to Trump's brain is a narrow room with a single window two doors down the hall from the Oval, where Jared Kushner sits. The President's son-in-law, a former real estate developer and onetime moderate Democrat, began pitching in with policy research on trade and taxes back in 2015, then took a behind-the-scenes leadership role that November after he saw Trump ignite a crowd in Springfield, Ill. By the end of the campaign, he had emerged as a kind of shadow campaign manager, guiding Trump where possible and reassuring worried Republicans on all fronts. He's playing a similar role this time around, as an architect of the campaign and troubleshooter, talking nearly every day with Eric Trump, Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel and Parscale.\n\nOne of Kushner's main projects has been populating the leadership ranks of the Republican Party with Trump loyalists. In February 2018, he and Eric Trump installed as head of the re-election effort Parscale, a lanky 43-year-old digital-marketing entrepreneur from San Antonio who engineered Trump's targeted online-ad blitz in 2016. Parscale has hired about 60 staff and worked with the RNC to create an online fundraising platform, known as WinRed, to compete with ActBlue, the Democratic digital juggernaut. Drawing on his tech-startup background, Parscale is also developing a smartphone app that attempts to \"gamify\" Trump supporters' engagement with the campaign by offering prizes. In exchange for getting friends to share their contacts, hosting Trump events in their home or knocking on doors, voters get perks like better rally seats, photos with the President, signed hats and other incentives.\n\nParscale, a 6 ft. 8 in. former college basketball recruit, sees his role as Trump's facilitator. \"He's the real campaign manager, the real finance director, the real director of everything,\" Parscale says. \"My job is to build a team that's ready to deal with whatever happens.\"\n\nMore often than not, the President will go off-script, and a campaign official likens Trump's knack for riling voters to an old night-fishing trick, shining high-power flashlights into the water to draw quarry to the surface. \"The United States is a pond. The President is like the lights,\" says the official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \"If he's not there, there's no light, fish are deep, I need a really big lure, it's expensive.\" But, the adviser continues, when Trump lights things up with an issue like immigration or trade, it becomes easy to draw prospective voters out.\n\nA rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., in late March offers a case in point. Trump issued an off-the-cuff threat to \"close the damn border\" if Mexico didn't stop two large caravans heading toward the southwest border. The crowd erupted in cheers. Electrified by the response, Trump told aides he wanted to move ahead with a plan to close ports of entry. A series of three tweets were drafted to be released on Trump's Twitter feed the next morning, announcing that large sections of the border would be closed the following week.\n\nAs news stories and web searches spiked, the campaign bought digital ads about immigration. Though the President later backed off the threat, his campaign kept the momentum going by spending $250,000 over the next nine weeks pushing out ads on Facebook and paying for clicks on Google Search. \"The content we produce, the advertising we platform, there's never been anything like it in politics,\" Parscale says. \"We have our own television show in a way.\"\n\nUsing such techniques, Parscale has built a list of 35 million voter contacts. The outreach has been churning for more than a year now. When Trump barnstormed Republican strongholds before the midterm elections, officials asked attendees to text wall or Trump to phone numbers plastered on signs and scoreboards inside the arena. Those cell-phone numbers, and other data collected through RSVPs, help the campaign construct a community-level map of energized supporters and prospective volunteers-a cohort they call \"the Army of Trump.\"\n\nSince 2015, Trump has used rallies to serve up a potent cocktail of tribal resentment and rage. They thrill the President as much as anyone: talking to TIME in the Oval, he boasted of 120,000 people requesting tickets to his official re-election kickoff on June 18 in an Orlando arena. \"This is the size of Madison Square Garden. I think it's slightly larger,\" he says. \"It's where the Orlando Magic plays. It is packed. We'll have thousands and thousands of people outside.\"\n\nThe familiar slogan has been updated-Make America Great Again has become Keep America Great-but the tone of the show has not. Trump promised in Orlando to build a wall to keep out dangerous \"aliens\" and called the Democrats' immigration policies \"the greatest betrayal of the American middle class and, frankly, American life.\" The swamp in Washington still needs draining, according to the President, even though it's now his bog. The crowd's enthusiasm waned when he talked about his achievements, but it broke out in raucous calls to \"lock up\" Hillary Clinton when he mentioned her name. \"Our radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice and rage,\" he said in Orlando, pointing to House efforts to investigate his 2016 campaign's ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the President. \"They want to destroy you, and they want to destroy our country as we know it.\"\n\nJim Messina, who ran President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, says this approach helps Trump dominate the national conversation on issues, like immigration, that motivate his base. Democratic strategists worry that the Trump campaign will have the chance to spend tens of millions of dollars building a campaign in the field and defining his opponents for months, all while the Democrats are mired in a long and brutal primary battle.\n\nWhat mystifies many is that Trump, a lifelong pitchman, has never bothered to sell himself to the broader public. \"The thing they are not doing, which I think is really odd, is doing any sort of general-election messaging,\" Messina says. \"By this point [in the 2012 election], we were in the Midwest trying to tell the economic-recovery story, which you would kind of expect them to be doing right now. Instead every single thing they're doing is about the base.\" The problem with that, he adds, is the nation - including the battleground states that will decide the election - is growing more diverse every year, which sharpens Trump's need to expand his coalition. \"If you just do a base strategy, then you're not going to be able to expand to any states,\" Messina says. \"And I think that is where this election is going.\"\n\nThere is, of course , a large section of the country, the government and its centers of power that have not bent to Trump's politics. That can infuriate the President. Halfway through the TIME interview, the subject turns to special counsel Robert Mueller , who survived nearly two years of attacks by Trump and his allies to produce a damning 448-page document enumerating Russia's efforts to help Trump win in 2016.\n\nSome of the people closest to Trump offered damaging evidence. His former chief of staff, White House counsel, deputy campaign chairman, Deputy National Security Adviser, staff secretary, communications director and others testified under oath, at risk of prison time, to acts by Trump that Mueller said were designed to \"influence\" and \"control\" the probe. While Mueller declined to say whether those acts amounted to obstruction of justice, Democrats and at least one Republican say they did. Pressed by TIME about his aides' testimony, Trump becomes angry. \"It's incredible,\" he says. \"With all I've done, with the tremendous success I've had, that TIME magazine writes about me the way they write is a disgrace, O.K.?\"\n\nThe moment provides a glimpse into why the Trump re-election operation runs on perpetual outrage. Those closest to him know a conventional campaign couldn't regulate a man who scorns political and ethical norms and is unable to let challenges to his authority pass. He isn't faking his outrage-about the media, the Mueller report , his opponents-and that anger, whatever its ultimate source, is politically powerful. \"Nobody has been treated as unfairly as Donald Trump ,\" the President says.\n\nThat in turn means that Trump's team may not have much choice in the kind of campaign it runs. \"A unique challenge Trump's campaign will always have is Trump is not tethered to the campaign,\" says Robby Mook, who managed Clinton's 2016 presidential bid. \"He is going to go out and do whatever he does every day. So his campaign will have to figure out, strategically and tactically, how to cope with that.\" The machine that Kushner and Parscale have built is designed to harness the power of Trump's grievance message, which resonates with tens of millions of voters. \"He's not pivoting,\" Kushner tells TIME. \"The President is who he is and doesn't pretend to be anything else.\"\n\nBut they also recognize they need to do more. The campaign is knocking on doors in African-American enclaves in Florida and North Carolina to talk up the landmark prison-reform law Trump signed in December 2018. It's also testing how to pitch Latino voters in New Mexico and Nevada on Trump's Chinese tariffs. \"The No. 1 issue driving Latino voters to like him and support him is his fight against China,\" a senior campaign official says, adding that the campaign is working to figure out why that's an animating issue.\n\nBut cranking the outrage machine for so long may make it hard for voters to hear a subtler frequency. Privately, some Trump advisers say they need to do a better job touting the President's record, especially on the economy. But can that message break through the pain Trump's tariffs have caused for many voters? And in the meantime, a large chunk of the campaign budget is still being spent on hot-button topics like immigration. \"They are trying to say they are running a normal campaign and doing outreach,\" says Messina, who now tracks ad buys for his consulting firm. \"It's all show.\"\n\nFor the moment, polls show Trump trailing the Democratic front runners in some key states. Trump is being briefed on polling data at least twice a month, and in the past few weeks has been requesting more granular breakdowns, according to a former adviser who speaks to Trump. \"He's aware that he's not beating any of the major candidates right now one-on-one nationally,\" the adviser says. He fired some of his pollsters after internal surveys were leaked showing him trailing Biden.\n\nTrump himself doesn't seem to know whether he can really beat the odds. Still fuming about Mueller, Trump keeps coming back to the investigation and makes contradictory claims about its effects. \"Based on the economy, I should be up 15 or 20 points higher,\" he says, but \"the thing that I have that nobody's ever had before, from the day I came down the escalator, I have had a phony witch hunt against me.\" Minutes later, he asserts the opposite. The Mueller probe \"turned out to be an asset,\" he says, \"because it's really energized our base like I've never seen before.\"\n\nThere's no question Trump has significant advantages as he looks ahead to the re-election fight, beginning with time and money and the biggest megaphone on the planet. In his position, most incumbents would appeal for four more years by pledging to unite the country. Casting this approach aside makes him \"historically unusual\" for an incumbent President, says Timothy Naftali, former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. \"He basically wants to beat the house, politically, again.\" Whether he wins his bet or not, Trump's campaign will test the power of outrage. -With reporting by Tessa Berenson, Massimo Calabresi, Edward Felsenthal and Abby Vesoulis/Washington\n\nCorrection, June 20:\n\nThe original version of this story contained a photo caption that misstated the location of Trump's re-election campaign headquarters.

      "text": "Donald Trump Explains All\n\nDonald Trump was interviewed by TIME Editor Nancy Gibbs, Washington Bureau Chief Michael Scherer, and political correspondent Zeke Miller on Aug. 18.\n\nFor TIME's cover story on Trump, read here.\n\nJeb Bush was asked about your comment on \"Meet the Press.\" You were asked who your foreign policy advisors are and you said you \"watch the shows.\" He said it's not enough to watch television. Do you have a response to that?\n\nWell Jeb is a very low energy person. So he can sit around a table all day long with one general and talk and talk and you know. But I see that general as being grilled by you. And when I say I watch on television, I do, and I watch on TIME Magazine, and I watch in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal , I read all of them a lot.\n\nAnd I get my views from the media. A lot of the views, and frankly other people do. And the views that you will see during those ten or fifteen minute segments or during reading the story are not a lot different than Jeb sitting around with a policy group, if he really has such a thing.\n\nBehind the cover: Donald Trump meets an American bald eagle.\n\nIt sounds good. I can say that too. You know I was an excellent student at the best school and I could also say, \"Oh well, I have a great policy group, and we sit around.\" I mean I wonder whether or not Jeb actually has that. But I'm being very honest. And I know when I say something like that, you can be criticized...When I see certain generals sitting at the different shows, I mean I think it's a great way to learn about what's going on. When I see the leaders of countries sitting on shows and frankly, you don't have to go through the whole process. It's a shortened version.\n\nSo I'm somebody that time is very important to me, and it saves time. But also you get really good views. You see some tremendous people.\n\nIn one of your books on leadership you actually said as advice to other people who want to be entrepreneurs, having a short attention span can be a benefit.\n\nWell I mean I have an attention span that's as long as it has to be. But I don't have to sit around with a group of generals to tell me about Iraq being a failure. Iraq was a total failure.\n\nSeveral of your rivals say that your experience in business doesn't translate. Chris Christie said, \"This is not negotiating a real estate deal. This is international diplomacy.\" What do you say to that?\n\nWell, I have the right temperament. I have the right leadership. I've built an incredible company. I went to a great school. I came out I built an incredible company. I wrote the number one selling business book of all time Trump: The Art of the Deal. I had tremendous success in show business-star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \"The Apprentice\" was one of the most successful shows. And as you know NBC renewed it, I just said I'm not doing it. They're not exactly thrilled with me at all. But I've had a great career, and I know how to get along with people. I know how to deal with people.\n\nI mean, if I was the governor of New Jersey, the George Washington Bridge would not have been shut. You talk about temperament.\n\nYou know people are talking about diplomacy, or tone. You know Bush brings up tone all the time. Tone. We need strong tone. We're too far behind. We're behind. We're not winning. You know if we were winning we could sort of soften it up.\n\nBut you look at Putin can't stand Obama, and Obama can't stand him, in all fairness. But we don't get along with anybody anymore. Hillary Clinton was the worst Secretary of State in the history of the country. The world came apart under her reign as Secretary of State.\n\nI want to ask you about the immigration plan you put out over the weekend. You had said in 2012 that Mitt Romney's \"self-deportation\" comment was crazy and maniacal.\n\nWell I thought it was stupid. Who's going to self deport? It wasn't that it was a bad plan from any other standpoint. But you tell people, oh, self deport. To me that just means what, you're just going to walk across the border and say okay. They asked me to go. That's not going to happen.\n\nSo how does the deportation happen under ...\n\nWell what we're going to do-we have a plan, and I think it's a really good plan. And by the way, it's been very well received and some of the candidates, my opponents I guess you could call them, but some of the candidates have said that's really what you want. I worked with a number of people on it including [Alabama] Senator [Jeff] Sessions, highly respected, and not known as a radical person at all. But we're going to have to - look, it's very simple. We either have a country or we don't.\n\nThe first thing I need is a wall, and I will build a wall. And you know that Hillary Clinton and almost everybody ten years ago wanted a wall built. Everybody wanted a wall built. But they couldn't do it because they don't know anything about building. They're throwing out numbers to build a wall. I'll build a far better wall, far higher, and just a much better-that's what I do. I mean the thing I do best is build. Which is not bad to have as a president because our infrastructure in this country is also crumbling. But we'll build a great wall. It will be a very effective wall. And it will be done quickly and Mexico will pay for it.\n\nBut the next step, if I understand your plan correctly, is that even the hardworking good people who are here without papers -\n\nThey're illegally here. They will leave, and they'll come back on an expedited basis if they...And they will leave.\n\nYou're talking about 10% of California's workforce, maybe 13% ...\n\nDon't forget in the meantime we have a real unemployment rate that's probably 21%. It's not 6. I's not 5.2 and 5.5. Our real unemployment rate-in fact, I saw a chart the other day, our real unemployment-because you have ninety million people that aren't working. Ninety-three million to be exact.\n\nIf you start adding it up, our real unemployment rate is 42%. We have a lot of room. We have a lot of people who want to work. But the good people I want them to come back. And I also want people of great talent to come to this country, to Silicon Valley for engineers. If you go to Harvard and you graduate number one in your class, and you're from China, they send you home, you can't get back into the country.\n\nSo you end up working for companies in China and fighting us. And they're competitors of us. They're trained in our schools. I want people like that to come into this country. And if they want, I want that path to citizenship for these people. So they go to our best schools, they're fabulous students, they do well, they're going to be great and we throw them out of the country. It's ridiculous.\n\nSo again, just talking about the hardworking peaceful undocumented immigrants here.\n\nIllegal immigrants, we're taking about the illegal. Do you know the word illegal? They go out ...\n\nBut do you forcibly remove them? I mean if they choose not to go, if they say, \"No, I'm not going to go.\"\n\nIt'll all work out. It's called management. Politicians can't manage. All they can do is talk. It's called management. And we'll do an expedited system. Because I agree with you, there are some very, very good people here who they are here illegally.\n\nBut they are illegal. We have to strengthen our border. We have to have people come in legally. And we will work out an expedited system where the really good people can come back legally.\n\nIf you became president, what needs to change about about Super PACs and campaign financing? It's a system that you've said is basically corrupt.\n\nWell I think this whole thing with PACs is nonsense. Because Jeb Bush puts his friend in charge of has PAC, and they don't talk....And he's going to work hard, as is Hillary Clinton. They all have their friends running the PACs. Now you're not supposed to talk, you're not supposed to - they go out and play golf, they get together, but they don't talk. Who believes that? So I want transparency. I don't mind the money coming in. Let it be transparent. Let them talk, but let there be total transparency.\n\nAre you willing to sign the \"No New Taxes\" pledge of Grover Norquist?\n\nWell I'm thinking about it but I have a problem because I may want to switch taxes around. I want to save the middle class. And I have hedge fund guys that are making a lot of money that aren't paying anything, okay. And I don't know how his pledge relates to that.\n\nBut I know a lot of bad people in this country that are making a hell of a lot of money and not paying taxes. And the tax law is totally screwed up. The complexity of it, the size of it. I mean I spent millions of dollars every year on lawyers and accountants just to do a tax return. And I want to put H&R Block out of business. I want to make it very simple. And we can leave the tax code the way it is and simplify it, or you could go to a form of a flat tax. You could go to a fair tax. There's a lot of things you could do.\n\nProbably the simplest is simplify the existing. Because we have other projects. We have to beat China. We have to beat Japan. We have to beat Mexico. We have to beat everybody that beating us, which is 100% of the countries that we do business with. We have a lot of other things to work on.\n\nAs president would you propose changes that increased the net amount of taxes?\n\nNo, because there's so much waste in Washington.\n\nYou���ve written more on leadership than any of the other candidates. George W. Bush or Bill Clinton, who is a better leader?\n\nI wasn't a huge fan of Bush, as you know...I thought he was lost. I thought he was not a great president...He certainly wasn't a good president. He got us into Iraq which by itself was a disaster. He also caused toward the end of his thing a financial problem by allowing exploding mortgages and other things that I predicted. I said you're going to have a huge bubble here. We have another one coming up by the way. I predicted that. You have exploding mortgages. I understood. I made a lot of money because I went in and bought a lot of stuff at the low price after it exploded. But he really gave us Obama. Clinton had a lot of problems with the Monicas of the world and had he not had those problems he would have had a pretty good presidency. Not a great one but a pretty solid presidency. But that was a disaster and a tremendous distraction.\n\nAre there any of the current candidates who you would not consider as a vice presidential candidate?\n\nWell I don't want to say because - I will tell you when it's all over, win, lose or draw, I'll tell you who I respect, who I don't respect. I think the thing that I most - that I'm very complimented by is that Rick Perry was doing really well, and then he decided he had to do better and he went after me and he went right down the tubes.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham was doing fine. Nobody got more publicity than this guy. He had zero. He's the only one that had zero. That means not one person in the whole country - he had zero. Like [former New York Gov. George] Pataki had zero but slightly more than that, right. He actually had a zero down today on the CNN.\n\nAnd these were the two guys that hit me very hard. And it was such a compliment to think - and now by the way Rand Paul's going down the tubes. Because all of a sudden he came out of nowhere and he hit me, and now he's ... Now I hit back very hard. I think I hit back maybe sometimes harder than they hit me.\n\nBut I came out with a very strong statement about Rand Paul. First of all I think he's totally taking advantage of the people in Kentucky. Because one of these afterthought, if I don't win here I'll go back to you. It doesn't work that way. Somebody should primary him out. Because he can be beaten, believe me.\n\nSo he's done very poorly. And since he attacked me, he's gone down. And I'm greatly honored by that, you know. I get attacked but somebody and they go down. I thought that a guy like Perry, he was getting so much publicity, he went to Washington, he read a speech, he did a whole big thing, it was all over the television. He went down. So that's a great honor.\n\nWhat happened with \"The Apprentice\"?\n\n[NBC/Comcast Executives] came up to see me. And even after twelve years and fourteen seasons it was one of their most successful shows. It was a great success. And they tried to talk me into it and I just wouldn't do it. And I just wouldn't do it.\n\nSo I didn't know this was going to happen, and they're impressed too. They probably didn't know this was going to happen either.\n\nDo you still retain an interest in the show?\n\nYeah I do. A big interest. So it's a very good question. When I say I'm not doing another season, that's a lot of money. And even if you're a rich person, that's a lot of money to give up... They would have paid me whatever I wanted. So when I did this...I turned down a deal last week in China, because I'd have to go there. One of the biggest companies wanted me to do a deal in China. Guaranteed tens of millions of dollars. Turned it down because I can't go to China... I've told my kids, this is going so wild. Let's see what happens.\n\nYou know I've had great success. Even in golf I've won many golf club championships. I don't know if you guys play golf. But to win a club championship is hard, literally hard. And you have to beat scratch players...You got a lot of good players. I've won many club championships. So my life has been about winning. My life has not been about losing. So I get a kick out of watching these guys who were not even successful people saying, \"Oh, he's just having fun.\"\n\nIt's not having fun. Actually I could have more fun. I own here's a picture, I own Turnberry in Scotland that just hosted the Women's British Open. I wouldn't mind being at Turnberry. I may never see it again.\n\nAre you surprised by your position?\n\nSo I'm a little surprised that it's gone with this speed. I don't expect to lose ever. But the speed is pretty rapid. You know. And unlike other people, I've stayed in the position.\n\nWhy run for president this time? You've decided against it in the past.\n\nSo it was really important that I do it, for myself...I mean I really considered it strongly last time. Before that I thought about it. But I never even had any staff. My secretary was my staff. But the time I looked at it was less time. But I was very busy, I was doing tremendous developments which are now completed and very successful. Because we're all over the world. And I had a signed contract with \"The Apprentice.\" I would have had to break it. The other reason I wanted to do this for myself. I didn't want to look back in ten years and say I could have done that or I could have done that. My family would look at me and say, \"Ugh, stop.\" I had to do it for myself.\n\nHow has this changed your life?\n\nSo I am enjoying it. And I think people see that...I'm watching my opponents. Certainly Hillary is not enjoying it, okay. She's going through something that for me, for me is Watergate. Her only hope is that because the prosecutors are Democrats she doesn't get prosecuted. That's the only hope she's got. Because what she did is wrong and what she did far worse than General Petraeus....And I saw her joke yesterday, it wasn't a joke ... but it was sort of like you're laughing at people's faces when they say - and they automatically - you know by saying they were automatically deleted, right, you know she made that statement yesterday, by saying that you're almost saying that you deleted them on purpose....It was supposed to be a joke. It wasn't funny, but there was a lot into that if you think about it.\n\nA lot of your supporters are not wealthy. They can never imagine themselves in your shoes.\n\nAnd they like me.\n\nYou're not the average American in a way, you've never been - but you connect with them. How do you explain that?\n\nActually, the funny thing is, I do worse with the wealthy people. Okay, it's funny in my opinion. Now, they'll all support me if I want them to, but I don't want them. If they want to send something, I don't care....I have a dot com. I had a woman send me $7 the other day. Another guy sent me $12. There was a long beautiful letter. I love that, because it's like they're investing. That's called a great thing. They're investing...They're doing that because they're investing in the campaign and that I really do like. But somehow I related to exactly what you're saying, to the middle class, to the working person, and people don't understand.\n\nYou come in on a Boeing 757, then you get on a helicopter, and you go over to the fair, and you give the kids the rides, which the kids loved. But you land in this incredible Sikorsky, and people like it. I've always felt that when Jimmy Carter would walk out of-off Air Force One carrying his own suits and bags, I always said, that's not what the country wants... He would walk off Air Force One carrying his suit and his bag. He's the President of the United States, and he didn't want anybody to carry his stuff, because he thought, \"Why should they? I can carry it myself.\" I always felt that's not what they want. They don't want that. They want someone who's going to beat China, beat Japan.\n\nI was in Los Angeles, I saw boats coming in with cars from Japan, the largest ships I've ever seen, loaded to the gills, cars just pouring off, made in Japan. How does that help us, and we give them a fraction-a tiny fraction-and they don't even want it. Those days are gone. Those days will be gone. But we have to make ourselves wealthy again in order to save our country. We can't continuously lose money.\n\nHow do you view the state of the American banking system?\n\nWe're having a huge problem, again. You know you look at the junk. You know all the junk that's floating all over the place. You look at some of this Internet stuff that's floating all over. We're in a bubble again, okay. It's not - and I'll tell you the problem with the banks, if you're really rich, like with me, if I want to borrow money I can buy all the money I want. But if there's a young Donald Trump that needs some money to do a couple of really good deals can't get it because the regulators are making it absolutely impossible for the banks to loan money.\n\nDo you want to repeal Dodd Frank and similar financial regulation reforms passed by President Obama?\n\nWell Dodd Frank is probably not a very good thing. There are aspects of it you could leave. But generally speaking Dodd Frank stifles business. It just totally stifles business.\n\nI'll tell you another subject that I'm going to start talking about because nobody talks about it. Corporate inversion, where companies are going over to other places. You know it used to be they moved from New York to Florida, they moved from New Jersey to...Pfizer is talking about moving to Ireland. Or someplace else. We're talking about Pfizer. Do you know how big that is? It would wipe out New Jersey. I mean that is a massive Merck.\n\nThey have $2.5 trillion sitting out of the country that they can't get back because they don't want to pay the tax. Nor would I. Everybody agrees that shouldn't happen. We should let them back in. Everybody. Even if you paid nothing it would be a good deal. Because they'll take that money then and use it for other things.\n\nBut they'll pay something. Ten percent, they'll pay something. Every Republican, every Democrat for years they have all agreed ... They all agree. So now what's happening is companies are moving out to get their money. And they're moving out because they'll pay lower taxes. That's a huge problem.\n\nYou don't have any Cayman accounts?\n\nNo I don't. I could have.\n\nHave you ever, because you'd benefit a lot I'm sure.\n\nI could have and I said - I've been thinking about doing this - that really hurt Romney in my book, when he set up these stupid accounts. In the end, when you do the Cayman accounts you don't gain that much.\n\nThe way you criticize the political process seems like the underlying theme of this campaign is that the people who are running stuff now are all phonies. That pretending it's something they can't actually do.\n\nThey can't do it.\n\nAnd they use pollsters to tell you what they think, that they're just not real. And then you're presenting yourself as the more authentic person. That's the underlying -\n\nI'm a person who's had great success in getting things done. They do use pollsters. I'm much richer than all of them put together. I don't want to pay a pollster. They pay these pollsters a hundred thousand dollars a month for doing what?\n\nAnd then these guys come in and they want to be tough. Like Romney, but the time he got to the last debate he couldn't even talk. He was afraid to say anything.\n\nIn 2014, you had Republicans saying we're going to take back Congress, we need it. And they raised five hundred million dollars to do it. The first thing we're going to do is repeal Obamacare. And they haven't done it.\n\nThey joked. They couldn't do it.\n\nSo do you think that they're not honest?\n\nThey got elected on the basis. So they got in, something happened.\n\nAre they the real phonies though?\n\nLook, I was just as disappointed in the Republicans as I am the Democrats. I mean at least the Democrats you know where they're coming from. The Republicans - and many of them got elected on the basis of we're going to get rid of Obamacare.\n\nIt's almost like when they get to Washington, I will not let this happen to me. They're so enamored with the magnificence that they sort of say, \"Oh, we can't do this. We can't do that.\" They become different. Does that make sense?\n\nIt's just so false and so phony and they can't move. It's moribund. They become weak and ineffective except at one thing: get themselves reelected...I have friends who are in Congress and they run every two years. And good guys, I've known then for a long time. As soon as that cycle is up, you know they win their election, then they take one day off and then the next day they start fundraising.\n\nAll they do it fundraise. They don't really govern. They just fundraise. Their whole life is raising money. And I say what percentage of the time you're raising money as opposed to legislating? ...I mean they're constantly - it's that time of year, you come in. I mean that's all they do is raise money.\n\nSo you say that they're puppets. You understand the game.\n\nThey're puppets. I'm the only non-puppet in the group.\n\nWhat was the best example of something you got from a politician?\n\nWell I wasn't an asker. I would just give just in case. I would always be treated well. But I'll say this. If the Speaker of the House, somebody they come up to see you and they'd like to know if you'd make a contribution. It's not a lot of money.\n\nLet's say you say no. \"No, I'm sorry, I can't. I have great respect for you, I like you a lot. I will not make a contribution.\" \"Oh, thank you Mr. Trump, thank you.\" Now let's say three years go by and I call, I need something from the Speaker of the House or I need something from somebody.\n\nWe're talking really human nature, okay. It's fairly hard. It's the rare politician that can do what's right in the face of massive contributions. And who can blame them. You could say you're disloyal. You can do whatever you want to say. But let's say you say no and then you call three years later. Nothing quid pro quo, none of that stuff. 100%.\n\nHillary's thing with the speeches is interesting because to me that's just as interesting as the emails. Because you look at the speeches and you look at the people who are paying all of that money for those speeches and then approvals of ... going to be granted are granted. To me that's as big a deal. People have forgotten about that.\n\nWhat do you think of David Koch?\n\nYes, he's a member of my club. Well you saw my Tweets on David where all these guys ... they're tying to get money and influence ... He's a member of my club... Big guy. So is his brother, a big guy. And I think they're well meaning people too by the way. I think they're actually very well meaning people. But when I see all these guys running over to go get money - okay so when David calls and needs something do you think they're going to say no? Possible. It's just something that's pretty far out. It's pretty much impossible.\n\nYou've said that you can't tear up an Iran deal on Day One.\n\nI'm a deal maker, when a person makes a deal ... But I've taken on some really bad deals and made the other side suffer.\n\nDo your rivals who say they'd tear up the deal understand how the world works?\n\nThey don't...It's a terrible deal. But I would enforce that deal like they never saw ... I'd demand to go - and the twenty-four day thing is ridiculous. And the fact that we didn't get the prisoners back is ridiculous.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with it....I'm a dealmaker...There are things in the deal that I'm sure Kerry doesn't even know about that I will find. And if they make a mistake they've got big problems.\n\nWhat do your daughters give you a hard time about?\n\nI've been very lucky, they're both smart and both went to the Wharton School. Tiffany goes to Penn and Ivanka went to the Wharton School, both very good students. Tiffany's got all A's, Ivanka the same, very good students.\n\nIvanka was interesting because I'm very strong on women's health issues. And I couldn't believe what Bush said last week about he wouldn't fund, essentially wouldn't fund women's health issues. And I hit him hard. And she came back and she said I'm so glad you did that Dad, because people don't know how you respect women, they don't know how you get it, and you have to get that word out.\n\nThere still seems to be a ceiling in the polls that there's a big chunk of the country who know you very well and don't want to see you in the Oval Office. How can you deal with that?\n\nWell they've been saying the ceiling from the time I started in six. When I first got in it was six. Well that's the ceiling and he'll stay around there ...There was one poll that said thirty-two.\n\nPeople are surprised, it's the Tea Party but it's also straight across the board. It's men, it's women, it's a lot of Democrats. In fact ... said you were better with the Democrats...The states where they know me best there's a huge positive. In fact I had the biggest swing of anybody that they've seen. You know what I mean, right?\n\nSo I think that's just a question of time. And I think that I will be the one to beat Hillary.\n\nYou'd told people that Bill Clinton told you a third party ticket is possible.\n\nWell he'd love that. I love a third party too. I think Bernie Sanders should run on the Green Party. I think that Bernie Sanders should run. I would love to see Bernie Sanders...Now look, I'm running as a Republican. I'm running as a Republican ... And honestly they've been treating me fairly. I don't want nice or anything I just want fair. They've been very fair.\n\nBoth parties approval ratings are falling even as yours have gone up. What's the problem?\n\nBecause I don't think the people running for office are real. Because Jeb Bush and others will come out against women's health issues because - and then he'll say he misspoke. You'll see that. He misspoke. Five hours late he comes in with the opposite...I really think they have to throw a lot of their consultants away and just be themselves. I think it's one of the things that's helped me. You know, I'm a smart person. I don't have somebody telling me what I should say.\n\nAnd I don't want to go against myself either when I believe in something. Because that's false. I saw it today with ... you saw it big league with [Wisconsin Gov. Scott] Walker today. When he made a statement based on my immigration plan and then his consultants said you've got to change that. But I think they would do better if they were themselves.\n\nDo you think there's any chance watching what has happened with you, that here will be a wave of authenticity?\n\nI think that's what they need. There's so little authenticity in many of the people that I'm watching. And that includes the other side. Hillary. I mean it certainly includes Hillary...\n\nWhat's the most significant learning experience in your life?\n\nLook, I do say this. Just in watching - I give speeches on success for friends and for charities. I put the money into charity. And they pay me a lot. I will say this, over my lifetime I've seen a lot of very smart people who were quitters. They never made it. And I've seen people that weren't as smart who never ever, ever gave up. And those were the people that made it. And I've seen it to this day. I've seen people that graduated ... in school who were super geniuses. And they never made it. And I've seen people that were not as smart as them and they're the biggest people out there. And the ones that are the biggest people are the people that never gave up. It's something I've just observed over the years.\n\nSo I take it you're not giving up.\n\nNo, I don't give up.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "BY MICHAEL SCHERER\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY NADAV KANDER FOR TIME\n\nEven for Donald Trump , the distance is still fun to think about, up here in his penthouse 600 ft. in the sky , where it's hard to make out the regular people below. The ice skaters swarming Central Park's Wollman Rink look like old-television static, and the Fifth Avenue holiday shoppers could be mites in a gutter. To even see this view, elevator operators, who spend their days standing in place, must push a button marked 66-68, announcing all three floors of Trump's princely pad . Inside, staff members wear cloth slipcovers on their shoes, so as not to scuff the shiny marble or stain the plush cream carpets.\n\nThis is, in short, not a natural place to refine the common touch. It's gilded and gaudy, a dreamscape of faded tapestry, antique clocks and fresco-style ceiling murals of gym-rat Greek gods. The throw pillows carry the Trump shield, and the paper napkins are monogrammed with the family name. His closest neighbors, at least at this altitude, are an international set of billionaire moguls who have decided to stash their money at One57 and 432 Park, the two newest skyscrapers to remake midtown Manhattan. There is no tight-knit community in the sky, no paperboy or postman, no bowling over brews after work.\n\nBehind TIME's Person of the Year Cover\n\nAnd yet here Trump resides, under dripping crystal, with diamond cuff links, as the President-elect of the United States of America. The Secret Service agents milling about prove that it really happened, this election result few saw coming. Hulking and serious, they gingerly try to stay on the marble, avoiding the carpets with their uncovered shoes. On his wife Melania's desk , next to books of Gianni Versace's fashions and Elizabeth Taylor's jewelry, a new volume sits front and center: The White House: Its Historic Furnishings and First Families .\n\nFor all of Trump's public life, tastemakers and intellectuals have dismissed him as a vulgarian and carnival barker, a showman with big flash and little substance. But what those critics never understood was that their disdain gave him strength. For years, he fed off the disrespect and used it to grab more tabloid headlines, to connect to common people. Now he has upended the leadership of both major political parties and effectively shifted the political direction of the international order. He will soon command history's most lethal military, along with economic levers that can change the lives of billions. And the people he has to thank are those he calls \"the forgotten,\" millions of American voters who get paid by the hour in shoes that will never touch these carpets-working folk, regular Janes and Joes, the dots in the distance.\n\nIt's a topic Trump wants to discuss as he settles down in his dining room, with its two-story ceiling and marble table the length of a horseshoe pitch: the winning margins he achieved in West Virginia coal country , the rally crowds that swelled on Election Day, what he calls that \"interesting thing,\" the contradiction at the core of his appeal. \"What amazes a lot of people is that I'm sitting in an apartment the likes of which nobody's ever seen,\" the next President says, smiling. \" And yet I represent the workers of the world.\"\n\nThe late Fidel Castro would probably spit out his cigar if he heard that one-a billionaire who branded excess claiming the slogans of the proletariat. But Trump doesn't care. \"I'm representing them, and they love me and I love them,\" he continues, talking about the people of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the struggling Rust Belt necklace around the Great Lakes that delivered his victory. \"And here we sit, in very different circumstances.\"\n\nThe Last, Greatest Deal For nearly 17 months on the campaign trail, Trump did what no American politician had attempted in a generation, with defiant flair. Instead of painting a bright vision for a unified future, he magnified the divisions of the present, inspiring new levels of anger and fear within his country. Whatever you think of the man, this much is undeniable: he uncovered an opportunity others didn't believe existed, the last, greatest deal for a 21st century salesman. The national press, the late-night comics, the elected leaders, the donors, the corporate chiefs and a sitting President who prematurely dropped his mic-they all believed he was just taking the country for a ride.\n\nNow it's difficult to count all the ways Trump remade the game: the huckster came off more real than the scripted political pros. The cable-news addict made pollsters look like chumps. The fabulist out-shouted journalists fighting to separate fact from falsehood. The demagogue won more Latino and black votes than the 2012 Republican nominee.\n\nTrump found a way to woo white evangelicals by historic margins, even winning those who attend religious services every week. Despite boasting on video of sexually assaulting women, he still found a way to win white females by 9 points. As a champion of federal entitlements for the poor, tariffs on China and health care \"for everybody,\" he dominated among self-described conservatives. In a country that seemed to be bending toward its demographic future, with many straining to finally step outside the darker cycles of history, he proved that tribal instincts never die, that in times of economic strife and breakneck social change, a charismatic leader could still find the enemy within and rally the masses to his side. In the weeks after his victory, hundreds of incidents of harassment, many using his name-against women, Muslims, immigrants and racial minorities-were reported across the country.\n\nThe starting point for his success, which can be measured with just tens of thousands of votes, was the most obvious recipe in politics. He identified the central issue motivating the American electorate and then convinced a plurality of the voters in the states that mattered that he was the best person to bring change. \"The greatest jobs theft in the history of the world\" was his cause, \"I alone can fix it\" his unlikely selling point , \"great again\" his rallying cry.\n\nSince the bungled Iraq War faded into the rearview mirror, there has been only one defining issue in American presidential politics, spanning party and ideology. It's the reason Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren thunders that \"the system is rigged\" by the banks, and Vermont's Bernie Sanders got so much traction denouncing the greed of \"millionaires and billionaires.\" It's what Marco Rubio meant when he said, \"We are losing the American Dream,\" and why Jeb Bush claimed everyone has a \"right to rise.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama identified it early, back in 2005, as a newly elected Senator delivering a commencement speech at tiny Knox College in Galesburg, Ill. Obama's hymn to \"the forgotten\" was his ticket to the White House. \"You know what this new challenge is. You've seen it,\" he said. \"The fact that when you drive by the old Maytag plant around lunchtime, no one walks out anymore ... It's as if someone changed the rules in the middle of the game and no one bothered to tell these folks.\"\n\nAs Obama explained it, the American promise was being put up on cinder blocks, buttressed by massive economic forces. His vow, repeated in his final 30-minute-long television ad in 2008, was change for the struggling, help for those who needed it, security for the ones who felt themselves slipping. Four years later, he would return to the same playbook to defeat Mitt Romney, casting the Republican nominee as an obtuse private-equity moneybags aiming to bankrupt Detroit. A quote pulled from a focus group-\"I'm working harder and falling behind\"-became the watchwords of Obama's 2012 re-elect, hung on walls and placed atop PowerPoints. He had identified the issue, and as long as his name was on the ballot, no one could beat him.\n\nBut Obama never fully delivered the prosperity he promised. There was certainly help on the margins, slowing cost growth for health care and providing insurance to millions, for example. He started some pilot projects for manufacturing hubs, increased incomes marginally in the past couple of years and led the nation to recover from a vicious recession, with the federal government directly creating or saving millions of jobs. An unemployment rate that peaked at 10% in October 2009 has been halved to 4.6% now, at the end of his term. But the great weather systems of global change continued under his watch. Ultimately, he grew resigned to the fact that there was only so much he could do in office.\n\nThe most recently available data tells the remarkable story: between 2001 and 2012, the median incomes of households headed by people without college degrees-nearly two-thirds of all homes-fell as they aged, according to research by Robert Shapiro, an economist who advised Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. As American productivity and gross domestic product grew in the first decade of the new century, median wages for all Americans broke away, effectively flatlining. Most Americans making less than the median income, but not so little as to qualify for poverty benefits, suffered income losses of about 5% between 2007 and 2013, according to research by Branko Milanovic, a former World Bank economist.\n\nIf you lived in the nation's great cities or held a college degree, you probably didn't feel the full fury of these forces. Average income declines for top earners were closer to 1% during the postrecession years. Global change is tricky that way. It enriches those in the developed world who can handle bits and bytes, create something new or sell their work at a distance. And it elevates the fortunes of the global poor, largely in Asia, pushing about a billion people from poverty into the beginnings of a new China-led middle class.\n\nBut for the working men and women of developed countries, many of whom had made good livings in the 20th century, the price of others' success could be seen all around, in peeling house paint and closed storefronts, in towns that went belly-up when one of the two big employers closed shop. The pressures pushed across the Atlantic Ocean. The size of the middle classes, as measured by those who earn 25% above or below the median income, dropped in the U.S. from the 1980s to 2013. It also dropped in Spain and Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. It is no accident that all those countries now find themselves in the midst of political upheaval as well.\n\nThe reasons for the shifts are more complex than the simple offshoring of manufacturing plants to Mexico or China. Global trade and new technology also pressure wages on jobs beyond the assembly line. When combined with rising health-insurance costs and incessant shareholder demands, companies found themselves unable or unwilling to give raises. Automation also accelerated as factories turned to robots, checkout lines retooled with self-operated terminals, and engineers developed self-driving trucks and taxis. Political gridlock in Washington, and the mild austerity it created, weighed everything down.\n\n'I hoped for change and never saw it' But properly diagnosing the problem doesn't help much if you live in a place that has taken it on the chin. In Shiawassee County, Michigan, which sits like a pit stop between Flint and Lansing, Obama won comfortably in 2008 and by a narrow margin in 2012. Then Trump tromped to victory this year with a 20-point margin. Rick Mengel, a 69-year-old retired pipe fitter, was one of the union members who voted for the young Illinois Senator in 2008, after seeing him promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Obama once called \"devastating\" and a \"big mistake.\"\n\n\"I hoped for change and never saw it,\" Mengel says of the Obama years. \"I watched jobs go away, and any jobs that came in were at McDonald's. I'm not knocking McDonald's, but it's a starter job. It doesn't make the car or house payments.\" When a friend bought him a MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN hat this year, Mengel took to wearing it everywhere he went. He never believed the polls that said Hillary Clinton would carry Michigan, because he can't remember ever sitting down with a group of five or six people and finding more than one for her. \"Hillary came along and she just never said what she was going to do,\" Mengel explains. \"She just talked bad about Trump.\"\n\nFirst he needed to define the bad guys. then he needed to knock them over.\n\nSuch voices were easy to find in central Michigan, northeast Pennsylvania and western Wisconsin in the days after the election. Here were historically Democratic counties that Obama had won twice, only to see Trump then win comfortably. They are mostly white parts of the country, with struggling Main Streets and low college-graduation rates, where the local beauty salons do better business than the car dealers. They are places where people start their life stories by recounting the good-paying jobs their grandparents held, or the long-gone second homes up on the lake where they used to play as kids. In the 1970s, the bumper stickers on trucks in Prairie du Chien, Wis., would read LIVE BETTER. WORK UNION . Now the sign in the local Walmart says, SAVE MONEY. LIVE BETTER.\n\nJoseph Dougherty, a former Democratic mayor of Nanticoke, Pa. who manages an automotive paint store, switched his voter registration this year for Trump. He was one of many in Luzerne County, a gorgeous river valley of rolling hills and former coal mines, who had lost patience. Trump cleared 78,000 votes in these hills, 20,000 more than Romney. \"The Democratic Party forgot about its base. It's all less for us and more for someone else,\" Dougherty said, explaining how he could betray the party he was born into. \"People are tired of surviving. People want to go on vacation, improve their home, get a better car, invest in their children's future.\"\n\nEconomists looking at the voting patterns since Election Day have been able to draw clear correlations between the local effects of international trade and voter angst. In counties where Chinese imports grew between 2002 and 2014, the vote for Trump increased over the vote George W. Bush won in 2000. For every percentage-point increase in imports, the economists found an average 2-point increase for the Republican nominee.\n\nIn some places, the shift was even steeper. In Branch County, Michigan, near the Indiana border, about halfway between Detroit and Chicago, a 3% increase in Chinese imports coincided with an 11% bump for Trump over Bush. The message of renewed protectionism, new tariffs and scrapped trade agreements broke through. \"His approach was much more visceral,\" says David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, who co-authored the study. \"He seemed to say, 'We don't have to adapt to globalization. We can reverse it.'\"\n\nIt's hard to find any trained economist who believes that's possible, at least in the terms Trump uses. The supply chains are too broadly dispersed, the pricing efficiencies too embedded in our lives, the robots too cost-effective. Then there are the dangers of massive disruption, the unquantifiable costs of trade wars, or the actual wars that could follow.\n\nBut Trump's improvement on Obama's sales pitch was never about the details. He communicated on a deeper level, something he has done all his life. His was not a campaign about the effects of tariffs on the price of batteries or basketball shoes. He spoke only of winning and losing, us and them, the strong and the weak. Trump is a student of the tabloids, a master of television. He had moonlighted as a professional wrestler. He knew how to win the crowd. First he needed to define the bad guys. Then he needed to knock them over.\n\nThe Presidency as Improv On Dec. 1, just weeks after his victory, Trump traveled to Indiana to announce that United Technologies, the 45th largest company in the country, had agreed to his demands and would retain 800 Carrier manufacturing jobs in Indianapolis. This mostly fulfilled a campaign promise he had made after the factory became national news when video shot inside showed the despair of workers discovering their work was headed to Mexico. \"Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences,\" he declared at the plant.\n\nThree days earlier, Trump met with TIME in his towering dining room. The Carrier deal was basically done, thanks to a mixture of $7 million in state tax breaks, presidential threats and promises of tax and regulatory reform. But it was still a secret. His running mate, former Indiana governor Mike Pence, declined to discuss the deal when a reporter ran into him in Trump's high-rise kitchen. But Trump could not stop himself. \"I'm going to give you this off the record,\" he said. \"You can use it if they announce.\"\n\nFor both conservative and liberal ideologues, including Sarah Palin and Bernie Sanders, the deal Trump struck with Carrier was an abomination, an example of government using taxpayer money to pick winners and losers. But as Trump told the story in his tower, ideology had nothing to do with it. This was just another tale of a little guy getting his voice heard.\n\n\"So the other night, I'm watching the news,\" Trump began. NBC's Lester Holt had introduced a segment on the Carrier plant featuring a union representative and a plant worker talking in a bar. The man looked at the camera and spoke to Trump, saying, \"We want you to do what you said you were going to do.\" Trump claimed this shocked him: \"I said, I never said they weren't going to move, to myself.\"\n\nBut of course he had, as the news segment demonstrated. So Trump says he had no choice. He had to listen to his people. \"He energized me, that man,\" the President-elect explained. \"And I called up the head of United Technologies.\"\n\nShortly after he spoke those words, Reince Priebus, the next White House chief of staff, walked into the room. With the tape recorders rolling, Trump began to issue new instructions. \"Hey, Reince, I want to get a list of companies that have announced they're leaving,\" he called out. \"I can call them myself. Five minutes apiece. They won't be leaving. O.K.?\"\n\nHe was talking as if he had just realized-at that moment, in the middle of an interview-that he had the power to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail. But it was just a show. At that point, Trump had already had a similar talk with Bill Ford of Ford Motor Co., and he boasted of putting out three other calls out to corporations with outsourcing plans.\n\nThis is the presidency as improv, as performance art, with good guys, bad guys and suspense. It's a new thing for the United States of America. The reporters in the room, the voters who will read this article, the nation, the world-we are the audience. A quick study who grew up in Kenosha, Wis., Priebus is far too Midwestern to be mistaken for a showman. But he got what Trump was trying to do, and smiled. \"It worked for you last time,\" he told the boss.\n\nMissing the Message History will record that Clinton foresaw the economic forces that allowed Trump to win. What she and her team never fully understood was the depth of the populism Trump was peddling, the idea that the elites were arrayed against regular people, and that he, the great man, the strong man, the offensive man, the disruptive man, the entertaining man, could remake the physics of an election.\n\n\"You cannot underestimate the role of the backlash against political correctness-the us vs. the elite,\" explains Kellyanne Conway, who worked as Trump's final campaign manager. His previous campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, put it somewhat more delicately: \"We always felt comfortable that when people were criticizing him for being so outspoken, the American voters were hearing him too.\"\n\nIn June 2015, Clinton's pollster Joel Benenson laid out the state of the country in a private memo to senior staff that was later released to the public by WikiLeaks. The picture of voters was much the same as the one he had described to Obama in 2008 and 2012. \"When they look to the future, they see growing obstacles, but nobody having their back,\" Benenson wrote. \"They can't keep up; they work hard but can't move ahead.\" The top priority he listed for voters was \"protecting American jobs here at home.\"\n\nThat message anchored the launch of Clinton's campaign, and it was woven through her three debate performances. But in the closing weeks, she shifted to something else. No presidential candidate in American history had done or said so many outlandish and offensive things as Trump. He cheered when protesters got hit at his rallies, used sexist insults for members of the press, argued that an American judge should be disqualified from a case because of his Mexican heritage. He would tell an allegory about Muslim refugees entering the U.S. that cast those families fleeing violence as venomous snakes, waiting to sink their fangs into \"tenderhearted\" women. And he would match those stories with bloody tales of undocumented immigrants from Mexico who murdered Americans in cold blood. \"His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous,\" Clinton argued.\n\nHis rhetoric had in fact opened up a new public square, where racists and misogynists could boast of their views and claim themselves validated. And to further enrage many Americans, Trump regularly peddled falsehoods, without offering any evidence, and then refused to back down from his claims. He promised to sue the dozen women who came forward to say they had been sexually mistreated by him over the years. He said he might not accept the outcome of the election if it did not go his way. He described a crime wave gripping the country based on a selective reading of statistics.\n\nFor a Clinton campaign aiming to re-create Obama's winning coalitions, all of this proved too large a target to pass up. Clinton had proved to be a subpar campaigner, so with the FBI restarting and reclosing a criminal investigation into her email habits, her closing message focused on a moral argument about Trump's character. \"Our core values are being tested in this election,\" she said in Philadelphia, the night before the election. \"We know enough about my opponent. We know who he is. The real question for us is what kind of country we want to be.\"\n\nThe strategy worked, in a way. Clinton got about 2.5 million more votes than Trump, and on Election Day, more than 6 in 10 voters told exit pollsters that Trump lacked the temperament for the job of President. But the strategy also placed Clinton too far away from the central issue in the nation: the steady decline of the American standard of living. She lost the places that mattered most. \"There's a difference for voters between what offends you and what affects you,\" Conway helpfully explained after it was over.\n\nStanley Greenberg, the opinion-research guru for Bill Clinton in 1992, put out a poll around Election Day and found clear evidence that Clinton's decision to divert her message from the economy in the final weeks cost her the decisive vote in the Rust Belt. \"The data does not support the idea that the white working class was inevitably lost,\" Greenberg wrote, \"until the Clinton campaign stopped talking about economic change and asked people to vote for unity, temperament and experience, and to continue on President Obama's progress.\" Interestingly, Greenberg said turnout among young, minority and unmarried female voters also decreased when the economic message Obama had used fell away.\n\nAnecdote, Not Analysis The irony of this conclusion is profound. By seeking to condemn the dark side of politics, Clinton's campaign may have accidently validated it. By believing in the myth that Obama's election represented a permanent shift for the nation, they proved it was ephemeral. In the end, Trump reveled in these denunciations, which helped him market to his core supporters his determination to smash the existing elite. After the election, Trump's campaign CEO Stephen Bannon-the former head of a website known for stirring racial animus and provoking liberal outrage-explained it simply. \"Darkness is good,\" he told the Hollywood Reporter .\n\nThis is the method of a demagogue. The more the elites denounced his transgressions, the more his growing movement felt validated. Shortly after the campaign, Trump tweeted that 3 million votes had been cast illegally on Nov. 8, a false claim for which he has offered no hard evidence. But when asked about it in his penthouse, he seems eager to talk about the controversy he stirred. \"I've seen many, many complaints,\" he says. \"Tremendous numbers of complaints.\"\n\nIn the dining room, a TIME reporter reads to Trump one of Obama's oft-stated quotes about trying to appeal to the country's better angels and to fight its tribal instincts. Trump promptly stops the interview in its tracks. The human brain is wired for anecdote, not analysis, and Trump's whole career is a testament to this insight. Even when his business failures mounted, he could always boast about the ratings of his hit reality show, The Apprentice, or that time he finished construction on the Wollman ice rink outside his window. \"So let me go upstairs for one second and get you one newspaper article,\" he says. \"Do you mind if I take a one-second break?\" And then he disappears into his living quarters above.\n\nHe returns a few minutes later with that morning's copy of Newsday , the Long Island tabloid. The front-page headline reads, \"EXTREMELY VIOLENT\" GANG FACTION, with an article about a surge of local crime by foreign-born assailants. His point, it seems, is that the world is zero-sum, full of the irredeemable killers that Obama's idealism fails to see. The details are more compelling than any big picture. \"They come from Central America. They're tougher than any people you've ever met,\" Trump says. \"They're killing and raping everybody out there. They're illegal. And they are finished.\"\n\nA reporter mentions that what Trump is saying echoes the rhetoric of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has overseen the extrajudicial killing of thousands of alleged drug dealers and users in recent months. The President-elect offers no objection to the comparison. \"Well, hey, look, this is bad stuff,\" he says. \"They slice them up, they carve their initials in the girl's forehead, O.K. What are we supposed to do? Be nice about it?\"\n\nDays later, Trump will have a phone call with the Philippine President, who called President Obama the \"son of a whore\" a few months ago. A readout from the Philippine government subsequently announces that during the call, Trump praised Duterte's deadly drug crackdown as \"the right way.\"\n\nPopulism Takes Center Stage A year from now, when Trump travels to the U.N. to address the world's leaders, he is likely to find far more sympathy for this hard-edged populism than any thought possible in 2008. Trump is all but rooting for it. \"People are proud of their countries, and I think you will see nationalism,\" he says, before describing the growing backlash against Muslim migration in France, Belgium and Germany. \"A lot of people reject some of the ideas that are being forced on them. And that's certainly one of the reasons you had this vote, having to do not with the European Union but the same thing.\"\n\nIn this view, Trump will find common cause with Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian President of Russia who, like Trump, seeks to challenge diplomatic and democratic norms. For reasons that remain unclear, Trump still refuses to acknowledge the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Putin's agencies were responsible for stealing the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails released on WikiLeaks. \"I don't believe it. I don't believe they interfered,\" Trump says. Asked if he thought the conclusion of America's spies was politically driven, Trump says, \"I think so.\" Since the election, Trump has chosen not to consistently make himself available for intelligence briefings, say aides.\n\nHe has also so far refused to acknowledge established diplomatic boundaries. When the Pakistani government gave a long, apparently verbatim readout of its President's call with Trump, India's leaders reacted with strained nerves. Then Trump accepted a phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, intentionally discarding a policy enforced since Jimmy Carter, which prompted an official complaint from China. In response, he sent out a tweet suggesting that such formalities, a bow to Chinese sensibilities, were ridiculous. \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,\" it read.\n\nAs he proved in the campaign, there are sometimes few negative consequences in politics for offending or painting a false picture of reality. History suggests the same is less true in international relations, where the stakes are not just votes at the ballot box but also the movement of armies and the lives of citizens. Among the tight circle that has formed around Trump, one can sense some unease as they try to navigate a mercurial boss to a successful first term. There is talk of strategies for steering him when he is wrong, for appealing to his own intention to succeed. And Trump himself, true to his reality-show persona, has a history of allowing his staff to fight among themselves for his attention. \"If I had to describe his deliberating style, I would say that it's very similar to Socratic method, just like in law school,\" explains Priebus. \"He asks a lot of questions, he wants answers to those questions to be thorough and quick, and he relies on the people giving him the answers to be accurate.\"\n\nJust a day earlier, Conway had gone on television to suggest that picking Romney, an old Trump foe, for Secretary of State was a terrible idea. Some Trump aides told reporters that this amounted to a betrayal of the boss, who had not yet made up his mind. Trump seemed to enjoy the spectacle. \"I might not like it, but I thought it was fine,\" he says at the dining-room table. \"Otherwise I would have called her up.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump has tried to curtail some of his own bravado since the campaign. The day after the election, Priebus says, Trump told his aides in his apartment, \"Guys, I'm for everybody in this country.\" Last year, Trump boasted about the great instincts that led him to support forced deportation for all undocumented immigrants and a ban on Muslims from entering the country. He has since backed off both positions. \"I mean, I've had some bad moments in the campaign,\" he says. But then he notes that his poll numbers seemed to rise after several of them, including his insults of Arizona Senator John McCain's war service.\n\nTrump claims that his unpredictability will be his strength in office. It certainly has left the political world guessing. He has so far refused to describe how he will separate himself from the conflict of owning a company and employing his children who do regular business with foreigners. On the one hand, he supports a broad policy platform shared by conservatives in Congress: a reduction in regulations, lower taxes, a pull back from the fight against global warming, and a cabinet filled with free-market ideologues. On the other hand, he has signaled that he is willing to break from Republican doctrine. His designated Treasury Secretary, the former Goldman Sachs banker Steve Mnuchin, has said Trump would back off his campaign suggestion that he would give large net tax windfalls to the wealthiest. \"Any reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nWhile Trump offered public words of support for the Iraq War at the time, he sees George W. Bush's great adventure as a disaster now. He rejects wholesale the social conservative campaign to keep transgender people out of the bathrooms they choose, but promises to reward conservative ideologues with a Supreme Court Justice of their liking. And he has little patience for the organizing principle of the Tea Party: the idea that the federal government must live within its means and lower its debts. Instead, he seems to favor expensive new infrastructure spending and tax cuts as economic stimulus, much like Obama did in 2009. \"Well, sometimes you have to prime the pump,\" he says. \"So sometimes in order to get jobs going and the country going, because, look, we're at 1% growth.\" The next day, the third-quarter gross-domestic-product estimates would be released, showing an increase of 3.2%, up from 1.4% earlier in the year.\n\nHe also suggests that some stock analysts may have misread his intentions. The value of biotechnology stocks, for example, which enjoy large profit margins under current law, rose 9% in the day after Trump's election, a rally of relief that the price controls Clinton had proposed would not happen. But Trump says his goal has not wavered. \"I'm going to bring down drug prices,\" he says. \"I don't like what has happened with drug prices.\"\n\nAs for the people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as youths and now have work visas under Obama, Trump did not back off his pledge to end Obama's executive orders. But he made clear he would like to find some future accommodation for them. \"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud,\" he says, showing a sympathy for young migrants that was often absent during the campaign. \"They got brought here at a very young age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in never-never land because they don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nTrump's America, for Better and Worse The truth is no one really knows what is going to happen, up to and including the occupants of Trump Tower. \"It's a very exciting time. It's really been an amazing time,\" Trump says, as the country still tries to come to terms with what he accomplished. \"Hopefully we can take some of the drama out.\"\n\nThat's not likely to happen anytime soon. Following a President who prided himself on sifting drama through the sieve of careful consideration, Trump's methods, for better and worse, tend to be closer to the opposite. And this is now Trump's America to run, a victory made possible either because of historical inevitability or individual brilliance, or some combination of the two.\n\nIt's an America with rising stock markets despite the tremors of a trade war. A country where a few jobs saved makes up, in the moment, for the thousands still departing. This is a land where a man will stand up in a plane headed to Allentown, Pa., to demand allegiance to the new leader-\"We got some Hillary bitches on here? Come on man, Trump! He's your President, every goddamn one of you!\"-and then get banned by the airline from ever traveling again. It's where a hijab-wearing college student in New York reports being attacked and jeered at in the next President's name, where American-born children ask their citizen parents if Trump will deport them, where white supremacists throw out Nazi salutes in Washington meeting halls for their President-elect.\n\nIt's a country where many who felt powerless have a new champion, where much frustration has given way to excitement and where politics has become the greatest show on earth. Here men in combat helmets and military assault rifles now patrol the streets outside a golden residential tower in midtown Manhattan. And almost every day at about the same time they let pass a street performer who wears no pants, tight white underwear and cowboy boots, so he can sing a song in the lobby for the television cameras with Trump's name written in red and blue on his butt. It's an America of renewed hope and paralyzing fear, a country few expected less than a year ago. Because of Donald John Trump, whatever happens next, it will never be like it was before.\n\n- With reporting by Zeke J.

      "text": "How Far Trump Would Go\n\nThis feature was published in April 2024.\n\nDonald Trump thinks he's identified a crucial mistake of his first term: He was too nice.\n\nWe've been talking for more than an hour on April 12 at his fever-dream palace in Palm Beach. Aides lurk around the perimeter of a gilded dining room overlooking the manicured lawn. When one nudges me to wrap up the interview, I bring up the many former Cabinet officials who refuse to endorse Trump this time. Some have publicly warned that he poses a danger to the Republic. Why should voters trust you, I ask, when some of the people who observed you most closely do not?\n\nAs always, Trump punches back, denigrating his former top advisers. But beneath the typical torrent of invective, there is a larger lesson he has taken away. \"I let them quit because I have a heart. I don't want to embarrass anybody,\" Trump says. \"I don't think I'll do that again. From now on, I'll fire.\"\n\nSix months from the 2024 presidential election, Trump is better positioned to win the White House than at any point in either of his previous campaigns. He leads Joe Biden by slim margins in most polls, including in several of the seven swing states likely to determine the outcome. But I had not come to ask about the election, the disgrace that followed the last one, or how he has become the first former-and perhaps future-American President to face a criminal trial . I wanted to know what Trump would do if he wins a second term, to hear his vision for the nation, in his own words.\n\nBuy your copy of this issue here\n\nWhat emerged in two interviews with Trump , and conversations with more than a dozen of his closest advisers and confidants, were the outlines of an imperial presidency that would reshape America and its role in the world. To carry out a deportation operation designed to remove more than 11 million people from the country, Trump told me, he would be willing to build migrant detention camps and deploy the U.S. military, both at the border and inland. He would let red states monitor women's pregnancies and prosecute those who violate abortion bans. He would, at his personal discretion, withhold funds appropriated by Congress, according to top advisers. He would be willing to fire a U.S. Attorney who doesn't carry out his order to prosecute someone, breaking with a tradition of independent law enforcement that dates from America's founding. He is weighing pardons for every one of his supporters accused of attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, more than 800 of whom have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury. He might not come to the aid of an attacked ally in Europe or Asia if he felt that country wasn't paying enough for its own defense. He would gut the U.S. civil service, deploy the National Guard to American cities as he sees fit, close the White House pandemic-preparedness office, and staff his Administration with acolytes who back his false assertion that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nTrump remains the same guy, with the same goals and grievances. But in person, if anything, he appears more assertive and confident. \"When I first got to Washington, I knew very few people,\" he says. \"I had to rely on people.\" Now he is in charge. The arranged marriage with the timorous Republican Party stalwarts is over; the old guard is vanquished, and the people who remain are his people. Trump would enter a second term backed by a slew of policy shops staffed by loyalists who have drawn up detailed plans in service of his agenda, which would concentrate the powers of the state in the hands of a man whose appetite for power appears all but insatiable. \"I don't think it's a big mystery what his agenda would be,\" says his close adviser Kellyanne Conway. \"But I think people will be surprised at the alacrity with which he will take action.\"\n\nThe courts, the Constitution, and a Congress of unknown composition would all have a say in whether Trump's objectives come to pass. The machinery of Washington has a range of defenses: leaks to a free press, whistle-blower protections, the oversight of inspectors general. The same deficiencies of temperament and judgment that hindered him in the past remain present. If he wins, Trump would be a lame duck-contrary to the suggestions of some supporters, he tells TIME he would not seek to overturn or ignore the Constitution's prohibition on a third term. Public opinion would also be a powerful check. Amid a popular outcry, Trump was forced to scale back some of his most draconian first-term initiatives, including the policy of separating migrant families. As George Orwell wrote in 1945, the ability of governments to carry out their designs \"depends on the general temper in the country.\"\n\nEvery election is billed as a national turning point. This time that rings true. To supporters, the prospect of Trump 2.0, unconstrained and backed by a disciplined movement of true believers, offers revolutionary promise. To much of the rest of the nation and the world, it represents an alarming risk. A second Trump term could bring \"the end of our democracy,\" says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, \"and the birth of a new kind of authoritarian presidential order.\"\n\nTrump steps onto the patio at Mar-a-Lago near dusk. The well-heeled crowd eating Wagyu steaks and grilled branzino pauses to applaud as he takes his seat. On this gorgeous evening, the club is a MAGA mecca. Billionaire donor Steve Wynn is here. So is Speaker of the House Mike Johnson , who is dining with the former President after a joint press conference proposing legislation to prevent noncitizens from voting. Their voting in federal elections is already illegal, and extremely rare, but remains a Trumpian fixation that the embattled Speaker appeared happy to co-sign in exchange for the political cover that standing with Trump provides.\n\nAt the moment, though, Trump's attention is elsewhere. With an index finger, he swipes through an iPad on the table to curate the restaurant's soundtrack. The playlist veers from Sinead O'Connor to James Brown to The Phantom of the Opera. And there's a uniquely Trump choice: a rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" sung by a choir of defendants imprisoned for attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, interspersed with a recording of Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. This has become a staple of his rallies, converting the ultimate symbol of national unity into a weapon of factional devotion.\n\nThe spectacle picks up where his first term left off. The events of Jan. 6 , during which a pro-Trump mob attacked the center of American democracy in an effort to subvert the peaceful transfer of power, was a profound stain on his legacy. Trump has sought to recast an insurrectionist riot as an act of patriotism. \"I call them the J-6 patriots,\" he says. When I ask whether he would consider pardoning every one of them, he says, \"Yes, absolutely.\" As Trump faces dozens of felony charges, including for election interference, conspiracy to defraud the United States, willful retention of national-security secrets, and falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments, he has tried to turn legal peril into a badge of honor.\n\nIn a second term, Trump's influence on American democracy would extend far beyond pardoning powers. Allies are laying the groundwork to restructure the presidency in line with a doctrine called the unitary executive theory, which holds that many of the constraints imposed on the White House by legislators and the courts should be swept away in favor of a more powerful Commander in Chief.\n\nNowhere would that power be more momentous than at the Department of Justice. Since the nation's earliest days, Presidents have generally kept a respectful distance from Senate-confirmed law-enforcement officials to avoid exploiting for personal ends their enormous ability to curtail Americans' freedoms. But Trump, burned in his first term by multiple investigations directed by his own appointees, is ever more vocal about imposing his will directly on the department and its far-flung investigators and prosecutors.\n\nIn our Mar-a-Lago interview, Trump says he might fire U.S. Attorneys who refuse his orders to prosecute someone: \"It would depend on the situation.\" He's told supporters he would seek retribution against his enemies in a second term. Would that include Fani Willis , the Atlanta-area district attorney who charged him with election interference, or Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan DA in the Stormy Daniels case, who Trump has previously said should be prosecuted? Trump demurs but offers no promises. \"No, I don't want to do that,\" he says, before adding, \"We're gonna look at a lot of things. What they've done is a terrible thing.\"\n\nTrump has also vowed to appoint a \"real special prosecutor\" to go after Biden. \"I wouldn't want to hurt Biden,\" he tells me. \"I have too much respect for the office.\" Seconds later, though, he suggests Biden's fate may be tied to an upcoming Supreme Court ruling on whether Presidents can face criminal prosecution for acts committed in office. \"If they said that a President doesn't get immunity,\" says Trump, \"then Biden, I am sure, will be prosecuted for all of his crimes.\" (Biden has not been charged with any, and a House Republican effort to impeach him has failed to unearth evidence of any crimes or misdemeanors, high or low.)\n\nSuch moves would be potentially catastrophic for the credibility of American law enforcement, scholars and former Justice Department leaders from both parties say. \"If he ordered an improper prosecution, I would expect any respectable U.S. Attorney to say no,\" says Michael McConnell, a former U.S. appellate judge appointed by President George W. Bush. \"If the President fired the U.S. Attorney, it would be an enormous firestorm.\" McConnell, now a Stanford law professor, says the dismissal could have a cascading effect similar to the Saturday Night Massacre , when President Richard Nixon ordered top DOJ officials to remove the special counsel investigating Watergate. Presidents have the constitutional right to fire U.S. Attorneys, and typically replace their predecessors' appointees upon taking office. But discharging one specifically for refusing a President's order would be all but unprecedented.\n\nTrump's radical designs for presidential power would be felt throughout the country. A main focus is the southern border. Trump says he plans to sign orders to reinstall many of the same policies from his first term, such as the Remain in Mexico program, which requires that non-Mexican asylum seekers be sent south of the border until their court dates, and Title 42 , which allows border officials to expel migrants without letting them apply for asylum. Advisers say he plans to cite record border crossings and fentanyl- and child-trafficking as justification for reimposing the emergency measures. He would direct federal funding to resume construction of the border wall, likely by allocating money from the military budget without congressional approval. The capstone of this program, advisers say, would be a massive deportation operation that would target millions of people. Trump made similar pledges in his first term, but says he plans to be more aggressive in a second. \"People need to be deported,\" says Tom Homan, a top Trump adviser and former acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"No one should be off the table.\"\n\nFor an operation of that scale, Trump says he would rely mostly on the National Guard to round up and remove undocumented migrants throughout the country. \"If they weren't able to, then I'd use [other parts of] the military,\" he says. When I ask if that means he would override the Posse Comitatus Act-an 1878 law that prohibits the use of military force on civilians-Trump seems unmoved by the weight of the statute. \"Well, these aren't civilians,\" he says. \"These are people that aren't legally in our country.\" He would also seek help from local police and says he would deny funding for jurisdictions that decline to adopt his policies. \"There's a possibility that some won't want to participate,\" Trump says, \"and they won't partake in the riches.\"\n\nAs President, Trump nominated three Supreme Court Justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, and he claims credit for his role in ending a constitutional right to an abortion. At the same time, he has sought to defuse a potent campaign issue for the Democrats by saying he wouldn't sign a federal ban. In our interview at Mar-a-Lago, he declines to commit to vetoing any additional federal restrictions if they came to his desk. More than 20 states now have full or partial abortion bans, and Trump says those policies should be left to the states to do what they want, including monitoring women's pregnancies. \"I think they might do that,\" he says. When I ask whether he would be comfortable with states prosecuting women for having abortions beyond the point the laws permit, he says, \"It's irrelevant whether I'm comfortable or not. It's totally irrelevant, because the states are going to make those decisions.\" President Biden has said he would fight state anti-abortion measures in court and with regulation.\n\nTrump's allies don't plan to be passive on abortion if he returns to power. The Heritage Foundation has called for enforcement of a 19th century statute that would outlaw the mailing of abortion pills. The Republican Study Committee (RSC), which includes more than 80% of the House GOP conference, included in its 2025 budget proposal the Life at Conception Act, which says the right to life extends to \"the moment of fertilization.\" I ask Trump if he would veto that bill if it came to his desk. \"I don't have to do anything about vetoes,\" Trump says, \"because we now have it back in the states.\"\n\nPresidents typically have a narrow window to pass major legislation. Trump's team is eyeing two bills to kick off a second term: a border-security and immigration package, and an extension of his 2017 tax cuts. Many of the latter's provisions expire early in 2025: the tax cuts on individual income brackets, 100% business expensing, the doubling of the estate-tax deduction. Trump is planning to intensify his protectionist agenda, telling me he's considering a tariff of more than 10% on all imports, and perhaps even a 100% tariff on some Chinese goods. Trump says the tariffs will liberate the U.S. economy from being at the mercy of foreign manufacturing and spur an industrial renaissance in the U.S. When I point out that independent analysts estimate Trump's first term tariffs on thousands of products, including steel and aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines, may have cost the U.S. $316 billion and more than 300,000 jobs, by one account, he dismisses these experts out of hand. His advisers argue that the average yearly inflation rate in his first term-under 2%-is evidence that his tariffs won't raise prices.\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has tried to engineer a caucus of the compliant, clearing primary fields in Senate and House races. His hope is that GOP majorities replete with MAGA diehards could rubber-stamp his legislative agenda and nominees. Representative Jim Banks of Indiana, a former RSC chairman and the GOP nominee for the state's open Senate seat, recalls an August 2022 RSC planning meeting with Trump at his residence in Bedminster, N.J. As the group arrived, Banks recalls, news broke that Mar-a-Lago had been raided by the FBI. Banks was sure the meeting would be canceled. Moments later, Trump walked through the doors, defiant and pledging to run again. \"I need allies there when I'm elected,\" Banks recalls Trump saying. The difference in a second Trump term, Banks says now, \"is he's going to have the backup in Congress that he didn't have before.\"\n\nTrump's intention to remake America's relations abroad may be just as consequential. Since its founding, the U.S. has sought to build and sustain alliances based on the shared values of political and economic freedom. Trump takes a much more transactional approach to international relations than his predecessors, expressing disdain for what he views as free-riding friends and appreciation for authoritarian leaders like President Xi Jinping of China, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, or former President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.\n\nThat's one reason America's traditional allies were horrified when Trump recently said at a campaign rally that Russia could \"do whatever the hell they want\" to a NATO country he believes doesn't spend enough on collective defense. That wasn't idle bluster, Trump tells me. \"If you're not going to pay, then you're on your own,\" he says. Trump has long said the alliance is ripping the U.S. off. Former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg credited Trump's first-term threat to pull out of the alliance with spurring other members to add more than $100 billion to their defense budgets.\n\nBut an insecure NATO is as likely to accrue to Russia's benefit as it is to America's. President Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine looks to many in Europe and the U.S. like a test of his broader vision to reconstruct the Soviet empire. Under Biden and a bipartisan Congress, the U.S. has sent more than $100 billion to Ukraine to defend itself. It's unlikely Trump would extend the same support to Kyiv. After Orban visited Mar-a-Lago in March, he said Trump \"wouldn't give a penny\" to Ukraine. \"I wouldn't give unless Europe starts equalizing,\" Trump hedges in our interview. \"If Europe is not going to pay, why should we pay? They're much more greatly affected. We have an ocean in between us. They don't.\" (E.U. nations have given more than $100 billion in aid to Ukraine as well.)\n\nTrump has historically been reluctant to criticize or confront Putin. He sided with the Russian autocrat over his own intelligence community when it asserted that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Even now, Trump uses Putin as a foil for his own political purposes. When I asked Trump why he has not called for the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been unjustly held on spurious charges in a Moscow prison for a year , Trump says, \"I guess because I have so many other things I'm working on.\" Gershkovich should be freed, he adds, but he doubts it will happen before the election. \"The reporter should be released and he will be released,\" Trump tells me. \"I don't know if he's going to be released under Biden. I would get him released.\"\n\nAmerica's Asian allies, like its European ones, may be on their own under Trump. Taiwan's Foreign Minister recently said aid to Ukraine was critical in deterring Xi from invading the island. Communist China's leaders \"have to understand that things like that can't come easy,\" Trump says, but he declines to say whether he would come to Taiwan's defense.\n\nTrump is less cryptic on current U.S. troop deployments in Asia. If South Korea doesn't pay more to support U.S. troops there to deter Kim Jong Un's increasingly belligerent regime to the north, Trump suggests the U.S. could withdraw its forces. \"We have 40,000 troops that are in a precarious position,\" he tells TIME. (The number is actually 28,500.) \"Which doesn't make any sense. Why would we defend somebody? And we're talking about a very wealthy country.\"\n\nTransactional isolationism may be the main strain of Trump's foreign policy, but there are limits. Trump says he would join Israel's side in a confrontation with Iran. \"If they attack Israel, yes, we would be there,\" he tells me. He says he has come around to the now widespread belief in Israel that a Palestinian state existing side by side in peace is increasingly unlikely. \"There was a time when I thought two-state could work,\" he says. \"Now I think two-state is going to be very, very tough.\"\n\nYet even his support for Israel is not absolute. He's criticized Israel's handling of its war against Hamas, which has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians in Gaza, and has called for the nation to \"get it over with.\" When I ask whether he would consider withholding U.S. military aid to Israel to push it toward winding down the war, he doesn't say yes, but he doesn't rule it out, either. He is sharply critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, once a close ally. \"I had a bad experience with Bibi,\" Trump says. In his telling, a January 2020 U.S. operation to assassinate a top Iranian general was supposed to be a joint attack until Netanyahu backed out at the last moment. \"That was something I never forgot,\" he says. He blames Netanyahu for failing to prevent the Oct. 7 attack, when Hamas militants infiltrated southern Israel and killed nearly 1,200 people amid acts of brutality including burning entire families alive and raping women and girls. \"It happened on his watch,\" Trump says.\n\nOn the second day of Trump's New York trial on April 17, I stand behind the packed counter of the Sanaa Convenience Store on 139th Street and Broadway, waiting for Trump to drop in for a postcourt campaign stop. He chose the bodega for its history. In 2022, one of the store's clerks fatally stabbed a customer who attacked him. Bragg, the Manhattan DA, charged the clerk with second-degree murder. (The charges were later dropped amid public outrage over video footage that appeared to show the clerk acting in self-defense.) A baseball bat behind the counter alludes to lingering security concerns. When Trump arrives, he asks the store's co-owner, Maad Ahmed, a Yemeni immigrant, about safety. \"You should be allowed to have a gun,\" Trump tells Ahmed. \"If you had a gun, you'd never get robbed.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump uses crime as a cudgel, painting urban America as a savage hell-scape even though violent crime has declined in recent years, with homicides sinking 6% in 2022 and 13% in 2023, according to the FBI. When I point this out, Trump tells me he thinks the data, which is collected by state and local police departments, is rigged. \"It's a lie,\" he says. He has pledged to send the National Guard into cities struggling with crime in a second term-possibly without the request of governors-and plans to approve Justice Department grants only to cities that adopt his preferred policing methods like stop-and-frisk.\n\nTo critics, Trump's preoccupation with crime is a racial dog whistle. In polls, large numbers of his supporters have expressed the view that antiwhite racism now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than the systemic racism that has long afflicted Black Americans. When I ask if he agrees, Trump does not dispute this position. \"There is a definite antiwhite feeling in the country,\" he tells TIME, \"and that can't be allowed either.\" In a second term, advisers say, a Trump Administration would rescind Biden's Executive Orders designed to boost diversity and racial equity.\n\nTrump's ability to campaign for the White House in the midst of an unprecedented criminal trial is the product of a more professional campaign operation that has avoided the infighting that plagued past versions. \"He has a very disciplined team around him,\" says Representative Elise Stefanik of New York. \"That is an indicator of how disciplined and focused a second term will be.\" That control now extends to the party writ large. In 2016, the GOP establishment, having failed to derail Trump's campaign, surrounded him with staff who sought to temper him. Today the party's permanent class have either devoted themselves to the gospel of MAGA or given up. Trump has cleaned house at the Republican National Committee, installing handpicked leaders-including his daughter-in-law-who have reportedly imposed loyalty tests on prospective job applicants, asking whether they believe the false assertion that the 2020 election was stolen. (The RNC has denied there is a litmus test.) Trump tells me he would have trouble hiring anyone who admits Biden won: \"I wouldn't feel good about it.\"\n\nPolicy groups are creating a government-in-waiting full of true believers. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 has drawn up plans for legislation and Executive Orders as it trains prospective personnel for a second Trump term. The Center for Renewing America, led by Russell Vought, Trump's former director of the Office of Management and Budget, is dedicated to disempowering the so-called administrative state, the collection of bureaucrats with the power to control everything from drug-safety determinations to the contents of school lunches. The America First Policy Institute is a research haven of pro-Trump right-wing populists. America First Legal, led by Trump's immigration adviser Stephen Miller, is mounting court battles against the Biden Administration.\n\nThe goal of these groups is to put Trump's vision into action on day one. \"The President never had a policy process that was designed to give him what he actually wanted and campaigned on,\" says Vought. \"[We are] sorting through the legal authorities, the mechanics, and providing the momentum for a future Administration.\" That includes a litany of boundary-pushing right-wing policies, including slashing Department of Justice funding and cutting climate and environmental regulations.\n\nTrump's campaign says he would be the final decision-maker on which policies suggested by these organizations would get implemented. But at the least, these advisers could form the front lines of a planned march against what Trump dubs the Deep State, marrying bureaucratic savvy to their leader's anti-bureaucratic zeal. One weapon in Trump's second-term \"War on Washington\" is a wonky one: restoring the power of impoundment, which allowed Presidents to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. Impoundment was a favorite maneuver of Nixon, who used his authority to freeze funding for subsidized housing and the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump and his allies plan to challenge a 1974 law that prohibits use of the measure, according to campaign policy advisers.\n\nAnother inside move is the enforcement of Schedule F, which allows the President to fire nonpolitical government officials and which Trump says he would embrace. \"You have some people that are protected that shouldn't be protected,\" he says. A senior U.S. judge offers an example of how consequential such a move could be. Suppose there's another pandemic, and President Trump wants to push the use of an untested drug, much as he did with hydroxychloroquine during COVID-19. Under Schedule F, if the drug's medical reviewer at the Food and Drug Administration refuses to sign off on its use, Trump could fire them, and anyone else who doesn't approve it. The Trump team says the President needs the power to hold bureaucrats accountable to voters. \"The mere mention of Schedule F,\" says Vought, \"ensures that the bureaucracy moves in your direction.\"\n\nIt can be hard at times to discern Trump's true intentions. In his interviews with TIME, he often sidestepped questions or answered them in contradictory ways. There's no telling how his ego and self-destructive behavior might hinder his objectives. And for all his norm-breaking, there are lines he says he won't cross. When asked if he would comply with all orders upheld by the Supreme Court, Trump says he would.\n\nBut his policy preoccupations are clear and consistent. If Trump is able to carry out a fraction of his goals, the impact could prove as transformative as any presidency in more than a century. \"He's in full war mode,\" says his former adviser and occasional confidant Stephen Bannon. Trump's sense of the state of the country is \"quite apocalyptic,\" Bannon says. \"That's where Trump's heart is. That's where his obsession is.\"\n\nThese obsessions could once again push the nation to the brink of crisis. Trump does not dismiss the possibility of political violence around the election. \"If we don't win, you know, it depends,\" he tells TIME. \"It always depends on the fairness of the election.\" When I ask what he meant when he baselessly claimed on Truth Social that a stolen election \"allows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution,\" Trump responded by denying he had said it. He then complained about the \"Biden-inspired\" court case he faces in New York and suggested that the \"fascists\" in America's government were its greatest threat. \"I think the enemy from within, in many cases, is much more dangerous for our country than the outside enemies of China, Russia, and various others,\" he tells me.\n\nToward the end of our conversation at Mar-a-Lago, I ask Trump to explain another troubling comment he made: that he wants to be dictator for a day. It came during a Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity, who gave Trump an opportunity to allay concerns that he would abuse power in office or seek retribution against political opponents. Trump said he would not be a dictator-\"except for day one,\" he added. \"I want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill.\"\n\nTrump says that the remark \"was said in fun, in jest, sarcastically.\" He compares it to an infamous moment from the 2016 campaign, when he encouraged the Russians to hack and leak Hillary Clinton's emails. In Trump's mind, the media sensationalized those remarks too. But the Russians weren't joking: among many other efforts to influence the core exercise of American democracy that year, they hacked the Democratic National Committee's servers and disseminated its emails through WikiLeaks.\n\nWhether or not he was kidding about bringing a tyrannical end to our 248-year experiment in democracy, I ask him, Don't you see why many Americans see such talk of dictatorship as contrary to our most cherished principles? Trump says no. Quite the opposite, he insists. \"I think a lot of people like it.\" - With reporting by Leslie Dickstein, Simmone Shah, and Julia Zorthian\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Donald Trump\n\nShort List\n\nPerson of the Year\n\nThe Short List\n\nTHE SHORT LIST\n\nNO. 2\n\nPERSON OF THE YEAR 2018\n\nThe President is forging a legacy that may be as much about the resistance he engenders as the goals he pursues\n\nTHE SHORT LIST\n\nNO. 2\n\nPERSON OF THE YEAR 2018\n\nThe President is forging a legacy that may be as much about the resistance he engenders as the goals he pursues\n\nMolly Ball\n\nSome Presidents have plans to change the world. They execute their strategies step by step and are judged by how far they get. Donald Trump came to the presidency by surprise and has attended to its responsibilities erratically. And yet, just as he rewrote the rules of politics in 2016 and remade the presidency in 2017, Trump left his mark on the planet this year.\n\nHe played a role in virtually every one of the year's major trends, from the battle over social media's influence to the populist wave sweeping Europe to the new direction of the U.S. Supreme Court. But his greatest impact hasn't come through conventional actions: the articulation of a governing agenda, the management of international relationships, the championing of legislation. Instead, true to the unpredictability that thrilled so many voters and worried so many others, he has been a disrupter, stoking political divisions, breaking institutional norms and weakening the power of the federal government from within.\n\nTrump's moves have touched the lives of millions. By loosening the rules on everything from water safety to banking, he has changed the balance of power between businesses and consumers. Disavowing decades of U.S. strategy in Europe, the Middle East and northeast Asia, he has scrambled alliances and emboldened strongmen. He has upended American politics, darkening the tone of the public debate and spurring both parties to remake themselves in response to his provocations. Scholars have compared Trump to Andrew Jackson for his populist fervor and to Richard Nixon for his willingness to attack the justice system. But Trump is a singular figure. \"He is in a category of his own,\" says historian Michael Beschloss.\n\nFor all Trump's influence there is a crowning irony: his ultimate impact may be determined as much by the resistance he engenders as by the goals he pursues. In some fights, expected checks have never materialized: Republicans have amplified his attacks on the American voting process, on the press, on immigrants and refugees. Yet elsewhere he has been rebuffed: domestic institutions from the courts to the Cabinet have resisted presidential overreach. In November, the people imposed a check on his power, ushering in a new era of divided government.\n\nThis year brought forth the consequences of Trump's disruption. The deficit soared. The stock market trembled. The voters revolted. Special counsel Robert Mueller circled closer. Trump has tested the system and exposed its weaknesses, but also revealed its strength.\n\n***\n\nWhen visitors see President Trump in the Oval Office or at his desk aboard Air Force One, Trump likes to ask an aide to bring out what he calls \"the dots.\" It's a three-page, bullet-pointed summary of what Trump considers to be his Administration's greatest accomplishments. Trump touts \"4 million jobs created since election\" and more Americans employed than \"ever recorded before in our history.\" He boasts of ordering the creation of a military space force, canceling the \"job killing Clean Power plan\" and withdrawing from the \"horrible, one-sided Iran Deal.\"\n\nThe list is trademark Trump, equal parts exaggeration and self-aggrandizement. But it also highlights the nature of his impact. Presidents are traditionally judged chiefly by their laws and wars. In 2018, Trump's accomplishments took place mostly in the absence of both.\n\nTrump could not get Congress to fund his border wall or pass his restrictionist vision for immigration policy. Courts put on hold his attempt to rescind protections for Dreamers. But he pursued his divisive agenda through the Executive Branch. Enraged by the flow of undocumented immigrants over the southern border (which, by historical standards, is at a low ebb), he put in place a policy of separating migrant children from their parents in order to send a harsh message to potential border crossers. It was officially withdrawn after a public outcry in June, but hundreds of children may have been permanently traumatized or lost to deported relatives. Thousands now reside in detention camps, while thousands more wait in a squalid converted stadium in Tijuana for the chance to seek refuge in the U.S.\n\nUntil the recent market downturn, most U.S. economic indicators soared throughout the year. The tax cut the GOP passed in December 2017 fueled corporate profits. With the unemployment rate at historic lows, wages rose somewhat and businesses complained of a hiring crisis. Trump spurned fiscal conservatism, boosting spending toward a $1 trillion annual deficit and ballooning the national debt by $1.9 trillion. He also abandoned his populist economic promises, which included raising taxes on hedge-fund managers, providing universal health care, spending on public works and reining in prescription-­drug prices. The result: majorities of voters considered their economic situation satisfactory, but few believed the President's policies benefited them personally.\n\nWhere Trump did follow through was on his promise to change America's trade relationships. In 2018, he pursued a protectionist agenda with zeal. The tariffs started small last January, with duties on washing machines, then ramped up with steel and aluminum, then escalated into a broad range of levies affecting allies like Canada as much as economic foes like China. Agricultural exports were hit hard. The President's policies punished corn and soybean farmers in the rural areas that had buoyed him politically and exacerbated an ongoing dairy crisis. Small businesses complained of rising costs. Trump touted his renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, in which Mexico and Canada agreed to new terms ostensibly better for U.S. industry. But the agreement was a minor modification of the much maligned 1994 deal and has yet to be ratified.\n\nWatch: Why the Guardians Are the 2018 Person of the Year\n\nTrump and the GOP found new ways to attack and under­mine the Affordable Care Act. Regulators pared back the outreach programs intended to boost enrollment and help people find coverage, while expanding the industry's ability to sell low-cost plans with fewer protections. The Administration declined to defend the requirement to cover people's pre-existing health conditions against a multi­state lawsuit. It also paved the way for states to impose work requirements on Medicaid; five have already received federal approval to do so, and ­Arkansas has put a program in place. But these moves came at a political cost: Democrats embraced Obama­care's rising popularity and campaigned to protect its most popular provisions. \"The Affordable Care Act is still standing, in spite of efforts to undermine it,\" says Larry Levitt of the Kaiser ­Family Foundation.\n\nHealth care was just one area in which regulators sought to accomplish what legislators could not. The ­Education Department abandoned Obama-era efforts to crack down on diploma mills. It also moved to replace college sexual-assault rules that even some liberals criticized for infringing on the rights of the accused. The Environmental Protection Agency rolled back pollution rules. The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, founded as a clearinghouse for consumer complaints about financial services, halted its investigations of companies and collections of fines. The Department of Justice ceased overseeing troubled police departments around the country. Millions of lives were affected by these often unheralded regulatory changes.\n\nTrump and his GOP congressional allies moved dozens of judicial nominations; approximately one-sixth of all federal appellate judges are now Trump appointees. Most dramatically, Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, then stood behind him when it looked like the pick might be derailed by Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school. By cementing a 5-4 conservative majority on the court, Trump may have remade the American legal landscape for decades.\n\nTrump's most consequential moves may have come in his attacks on the U.S. justice system. In the spring, he reportedly ordered prosecutors to target Hillary ­Clinton for investigation, and in May he alleged the FBI had tried to infiltrate his presidential campaign for political purposes. He fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions for insufficient ­fealty in the Mueller investigation. He has publicly and privately pressured law-enforcement officials, commented on cases under way, teased the prospect of pardons and opined on witnesses' credibility, all actions that threaten the judicial system's independence and integrity.\n\n***\n\nThe first two weeks of March captured Trump's disruptive approach to foreign policy. On March 8 he fulfilled a long-delayed promise to impose tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. The same day, hearing that a delegation from South Korea was in the White House to meet with other officials, Trump summoned them to the Oval Office and stunned his aides by agreeing on the spot to an unprecedented face-to-face meeting with the reclusive North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un. On March 13 Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former oil executive whose cautious style he'd mocked. Two months later, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nAs 2018 progressed, Trump dismissed advisers who had previously constrained him on trade and diplomacy. In doing so, he scrambled the economic relationships that had held together the post-Cold War international order. Critics say he has made America less essential and more isolated on the world stage. \"I think this President has done enormous damage to the United States,\" says ­Nicholas Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and top State Department official under George W. Bush.\n\nTrump's June summit with Kim ended in warm handshakes and friendly rhetoric. But there was no formal agreement, and U.S. investigators say North Korea has continued to pursue its nuclear and missile programs. Kim was not the only dictator Trump cozied up to. In July, Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, talking without aides present for over two hours, then emerging to declare that Putin \"was extremely strong and powerful in his denial\" of meddling in the 2016 election. In November, Trump took the side of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who allegedly directed the murder and dismemberment of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The damage to America's moral standing, Trump's critics say, may be hard to repair. \"We grew up in a totalitarian state, seeing America as a hope,\" says Vladimir Milov, a Russian opposition leader and former Energy Minister. \"It represented a normal system, values, freedom. It is no longer.\"\n\nTrump's actions have real effects beyond matters of image and reputation. In November, for example, French President Emmanuel Macron called for the creation of a \"true European army,\" apparently in reaction to Trump's criticism of NATO and friendliness with Russia. Countries that were close allies with the U.S. have begun to seek partnerships with China instead. Meanwhile, Beijing has made incursions into disputed territory in the South China Sea, conducting \"training exercises\" that U.S. officials say are a cover for military buildup. Trump \"has created tremendous uncertainty, and that creates an opportunity for others to fill the void,\" says John Glenn, policy director of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition. \"China, especially, has taken advantage.\"\n\n***\n\nIn a democracy , accountability rests with the people, which can be a dicey proposition: the people, after all, have a tendency to be inattentive, irrational and mercurial. But they also possess the ability to send a message through the ballot box that their leaders have to heed.\n\nOn Nov. 6, in the nation's first major opportunity to register its verdict on the Trump era, the signal was unmistakable. After all the votes were counted, the Democratic Party's congressional candidates had won the largest proportion of the vote, 53%, since the post-Watergate landslide of 1974. They gained 40 seats in the House of Representatives, seven governorships and hundreds of seats in state legislatures.\n\nDemocrats campaigned mainly on pocketbook issues, telling voters they'd protect Social Security and the Affordable Care Act. But it was clear that Trump was the axis on which the election turned. Two-thirds of midterm voters told exit pollers they'd cast their ballots to send a message about the President. Independent voters swung hard toward the Democrats, and college-­educated women were particularly determined to show their disapproval. Democrats won the states that put Trump in the White House-­Pennsylvania, Michigan, ­Wisconsin-and took over suburban districts from Orange County, California, to Charleston, Atlanta and Oklahoma City. It was the largest midterm election turnout in more than a century. While a typical midterm draws only about half as many voters as a presidential election, the number of ballots cast for Democrats in 2018 reached 92% of the total Hillary Clinton received when she won the popular vote in 2016.\n\nThe President galvanized his party as well. He sent troops to the border in a brazen political stunt weeks before the vote, barnstormed rural strongholds and rallied Republicans to the polls with a divisive closing message. Most Presidents struggle to rouse their bases when they're not on the ballot, but Trump did, helping to limit GOP losses in parts of the country where he remains popular and powering his party to a two-seat gain in the ­Senate-a split decision that augurs even deeper political divides.\n\nTrump's pull on the GOP appears almost mesmeric. The party that once stood for free markets and moral values now stands for whatever Trump wants it to, whether it's antagonism to federal law enforcement, enthusiasm for Russia's authoritarian regime, the rejection of refugees or a belief in \"deep state\" conspiracy theories. This year's Republican primaries unfolded as loyalty competitions, and the winning candidates were generally those who professed their enthusiasm for the President most effusively: Florida's governor-elect beat a more experienced GOP contender with an ad that showed him teaching his infant daughter to read a Trump campaign sign. In the general election, Republican candidates largely abandoned talk of tax cuts and judicial appointments in favor of the President's preferred themes of illegal immigration and \"fake news.\"\n\nBut as much as Trump inspired his supporters, he inspired everyone else even more. Before Trump came along, political organizers tied themselves in knots trying to get more women to run for office, usually to little avail. In 2018, thousands of women decided to seek election, explaining that they had been spurred off the sidelines by the President. First-time candidates from diverse backgrounds won Democratic primaries: former Republicans, former CIA operatives, former mixed-martial-arts fighters-all driven by what felt to them like a national political emergency­.\n\nMillions more took political action on their behalf, protesting, canvassing, sending handwritten postcards to voters. The result is that a record 126 women will serve in the next Congress, nearly a quarter of the total-84% of them Democrats. The new face of the Democratic Party is the face of Trump's opposition: women, young people and people of color.\n\nThis is the next generation of American politics, and it's one Trump made. Democrats are already maneuvering for the 2020 presidential primaries, promising a roiling debate over the party's direction. But above all, that battle will be a competition about who can beat Trump.\n\n***\n\nTwo years into Trump's term , it's hard to gauge whether the result of his disruptions will be catastrophic or anticlimactic. In many cases Trump has spotlighted long-unaddressed problems. NATO countries have, in fact, under­funded the defense targets of the alliance. China has been cheating the U.S. on intellectual property for years and maintaining an advantage on trade. Global migration has put pressure on liberal democracies worldwide. Even Hillary Clinton recently said that European countries need to reform their immigration policies in response to resurgent right-wing parties.\n\nAmerican democracy can seem dysfunctional, with its gridlocked Congress and polarized public debate. But many ­institutions-the military, the justice system, the courts-have risen to resist Trump's attacks. Trump has tested the nation, and some pillars of American democracy have proved up to the challenge, says presidential historian Timothy Naftali. \"Trump is the first President to make undermining routinely our public institutions part of his brand,\" he says. \"Our judiciary is standing up to his Administration when it crosses a line. The Mueller investigation is going forward. Intimates of the President have been indicted. That wouldn't be happening if our institutions were falling apart.\"\n\nFor all the disruption, in other words, the American system is proving remarkably resilient. That too may be part of Trump's legacy. -With reporting by Brian Bennett/Washington"

      "text": "Donald Trump Photographs: Behind Greatest Portraits\n\nIt's an unprecedented match-up of familiar faces. The major-party presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have spent decades in the public eye as key figures of American culture. Their portraits have covered magazines, newspapers and websites.\n\nWe asked some of the greatest portrait shooters who have photographed Donald Trump to scour their archives and select their favorite photographs from these one-on-one sessions.\n\nHere are the stories, told by the photographers, behind these iconic portraits. -Tara Johnson, Chelsea Matiash and Paul Moakley.\n\nWilliam Coupon , portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for Manhattan,inc. in 1983: \"I shot Donald Trump twice. This is my favorite. Trump was offering his services as a 'peace negotiator' between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We thought: get the bird, which proceeded to leave droppings behind. Trump was amenable enough, but not at all happy. But ultimately, it was that something in his eyes. His eyes. Not the bird's.\"\n\nMichael O'Neill , portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for the New York Times Magazine in 1984: \"1984 - in many ways. Gilt, gold, pride... He loved the cover! It was his first for the New York Times Magazine .\"\n\nHarry Benson , photojournalist, who shot Trump in Atlantic City, N.J. for People in 1990: \"Shortly after the Taj Mahal opened in Atlantic City in 1990, I was there to photograph Donald Trump. He told me there was over a million dollars in the 'cage' in the casino where the money is kept. I told him I had never seen a million dollars. Donald proceeded to walk right in and pick up exactly a million dollars to hold for the photograph which caused quite a stir as it was totally against the rules of the casino. When some of the money started to fall off his lap, I found it was the most interesting photograph of the day.\"\n\nMax Vadukul , portrait photographer, who shot Trump at Mar-a Largo, Fla., for The New Yorker on May 19, 1997: \"This is one of many 'air' shots I did with Mr. Trump. There is a lot going in this image, it's complicated, sophisticated and strong in its power. I had shown Mr. Trump exactly what I wanted and he had that look that says, 'Oh I can do better than that.' And after just one effort - because it's a big effort physically to do this for 12 frames - he totally nailed it and went even further. What I like about this image, which is now an iconic shot, is the attitude, the elegance, the confidence. Of course, I did not know him at all at that time, but the personality came thru and today he is running for President. This image says a lot.\"\n\nTomo Muscionico , photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for Spiegel in September 1999: \"Looking back, I think it's a powerful portrait of a mogul whose body language shows his privilege, sexuality and arrogance. This subtle moment with him in a limousine says it all.\"\n\nPlaton , photographer, who shot Trump in New York for Fortune on August 21, 2003: \"I photographed Mr. Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan. It was a cathedral of gaudy, post-modern excess. I asked him to look straight into the camera, trying to get his head as symmetrical as possible. With a glint in his eye, he looked at me and said, 'No - this is my best side.' He turned to his right cheek, as if to present me with Trump Inc. on his terms. I thought about this moment many times since the picture, and for me, it says something fascinating about the character of this extraordinary, disrupting figure. For me, he understands the media. He's comfortable within his own skin. He's happy to play with the process of photography and film, and consequently is able to project his own brand of authenticity. I believe he has singlehandedly transformed the political and media landscape this year. Our presidential election has essentially been turned into a reality TV show. All media pundits and political opponents have been forced to play on Donald's terms.\"\n\nAndres Serrano , photographer, who shot Trump in 2004 for the series America : \"Shortly after Sept. 11, I started a series called America . I felt America had been attacked as the 'enemy' and I wanted to show who the 'enemy' was. I took over a hundred portraits of people from all walks of life over a three-year period. Donald Trump's portrait, taken in 2004, was the last one taken.\"\n\nChris Buck , photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for Philadelphia Magazine on March 29, 2006: \"Once we finished with the required set-ups that my client needed I brought out an 11×14\" print from a previous shoot that Donald Trump and I had done together. He asked, 'What is this?' I said, 'I'm giving you this print as a gift-to buy an extra set-up from you.' He shrugged and said, 'Okay,' and this is how I got him to pose for this picture. It's shot in the conference room for Trump's real estate business. With Trump now running for president I get a lot of comments on this photograph. Most people see 'the many faces of Donald Trump,' but I see it more as 'the broken man,' which may well be more a reflection of my state of mind, not his, as is the case for most of my portraits - they're about my discomfort, not the sitter's.\"\n\nMarco Grob , portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for TIME on April 5, 2011: \"I'm interested in faces beyond their genetics. I've spent a lifetime wondering why we wear the faces we have. Why do people desire power? What are their motives? Can you see these motives in their faces? Or in their gestures? What about their body language? I've met many people of power, and I don't attempt to provide the answer, but I strive to provide the question. I often wonder who else asks these questions? This frame really spoke to me as one where Trump was trying to connect with me behind the camera. That being said, his connection was ice cold, he was all business.\"\n\nPeter Yang , photographer, who shot Trump in New York for Rolling Stone in 2011: \"When I was commissioned to photograph Donald Trump in 2011, the first thing that came to mind was this gold-plated tree stump I'd been eyeing at a ritzy furniture store down the street from me. I had been to Trump's house before (to photograph Melania Trump) and noted the bevy of things gold. Gold leafing on all the walls, a gold front door, even a golden toilet. With the log in mind, the idea of Trump being the Thinker came next, and while I loved the idea, I was pretty sure he would nix it.\n\nOn the day of the shoot, I was told to work fast, real fast. His people said I had 10 minutes, which usually meant 5-7 before you're getting that thanks-and-goodbye handshake. Arnold Schwarzenegger once gave me one of those handshakes after 40 seconds or so. \"That's what I like about you\", he said, \"you're quick.\"\n\nI had three setups ready to go when Mr. Trump got there. There were two safe shots, then the Thinker. The first shot was Trump in front of the Manhattan skyline. Pretty standard stuff and it only took a minute. Trump was way more understated than I imagined he'd be, almost soft spoken. I'd mostly seen him firing people on The Apprentice , and I was glad I didn't get that guy. The second shot was a close-up portrait of him. It's always interesting to see famous folks up close, and when he, unprompted, pointed and yelled into the camera, I knew I got the shot.\n\nWe then walked over to the gold log. I took a deep breath and showed him a picture of the Thinker. Before I could say anything, he grabbed the paper out of my hand, studied it for a moment, and hit his mark on the log. I snapped a few frames, he shook my hand, and was quickly out the door.\"\n\nMartin Schoeller , photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for TIME in August 2015: \"I wanted to play on this idea that he thinks of himself as a great leader and savior of the American people. I thought what could be better than our national bird. It's the perfect symbol. Having worked with birds of prey in the past, I knew that it wouldn't be easy and there would be a lot of room for surprise. I thought those two attitudes colliding was the perfect match.\"\n\nNigel Parry , portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York for Esquire in November 2015: \"After being unable to fulfill the brief due to Mr. Trump insisting that I couldn't photograph his profile, I decided the only route was a confrontational photograph for a confrontational subject. I think this photo fits the bill.\"\n\nRead the Stories Behind the Best Portraits of Hillary Clinton\n\nFollow TIME LightBox on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\n\nYour browser is out of date.

      "text": "A TIME Exclusive: Donald Trump After Hours\n\nFrom where the 45th President works, eats and sleeps, everything is going just great. Now if only everyone else would see it that way.\n\nBY Michael Scherer and Zeke J. Miller\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY BENJAMIN RASMUSSEN FOR TIME\n\nIn a few minutes, President Donald Trump will release a new set of tweets, flooding social-media accounts with his unique brand of digital smelling salts-words that will jolt his supporters and provoke his adversaries.\n\nNearly a dozen senior aides stand in the Oval Office, crowding behind couches or near door-length windows. This is the way he likes to work, more often than not: in a crowd. He sits behind his desk finishing the tasks of the day, which have included watching new Senate testimony about Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election, by signing orders in red folders with a black Sharpie.\n\nWhen he held the job, Barack Obama tended to treat the Oval Office like a sanctum sanctorum, accessible only for a small circle of advisers to break its silence on a tightly regulated schedule. For Trump, the room functions as something like a royal court or meeting hall, with open doors that senior aides and ­distinguished visitors flock through when he is in the building.\n\nIn practice, it feels much like his old corner office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, minus all the clutter of memorabilia, a place to convene an audience, to broadcast his exceptionalism, to entertain, take photos, amaze and make deals. Some aides still call him \"Mr. Trump,\" and everyone turns to listen when he speaks. His presence always seems to consume the room.\n\nAnd the stream of visitors is constant. Just a few hours earlier, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster had stopped by with a foreign military delegation. Vice President Mike Pence brought by the Prime Minister of Georgia unscheduled for a photo. The New England ­Patriots got to take pictures behind the desk recently, and the President says the billionaire Ronald Lauder, a great collector of art, went crazy when he saw the painting of George Washington above the fireplace. \"Never had people,\" Trump likes to say of Obama's use of the space. \"I use the room. I use it a lot. I had the biggest people in the country here.\"\n\nBut right now, there is something else he wants to show. It's down the hall, in his private dining room in the West Wing, a few steps away. As is often the case when reporters come through, he has a plan, a story he wants to tell. Tonight, at dusk on May 8, he invites three TIME correspondents for a tour of his home and office, followed by a four-course dinner in the Blue Room, the oval-shaped parlor on the first floor of the executive mansion. The first three months of his presidency have been unsettling, a blur of confrontation, policy pivots and regulatory revolution. Financial markets have climbed, cruise missiles have fallen, and the world has watched with trepidation and confusion. In less than 24 hours, Trump will roil the nation again by announcing the firing of his FBI Director, James Comey, who is leading an investigation of his campaign's ties to Russia. It will set off yet another firestorm. But for now, it's showtime once again.\n\n\"You'll see something that is amazing. It just happened,\" he says as he stands up from the desk. \"Come on, I'll show you.\"\n\nTrump, with Pence, watches a replay of Senate hearings from a private dining room near the Oval Office\n\nEach president leaves his mark on the building, and Trump has wasted little time making his. The modern art favored by the Obama family is mostly gone, replaced with classic oils, including portraits of Trump's favorite predecessors, like Andrew Jackson and Teddy Roosevelt. Gold curtains have replaced the maroon ones in the Oval Office, and military-service flag stands have been added around the room, topped by battle ribbons and held in place by heavy brass bases that Trump praises to visitors.\n\nBut few rooms have changed so much so fast as his dining room, where he often eats his lunch amid stacks of newspapers and briefing sheets. A few weeks back, the President ordered a gutting of the room. \"We found gold behind the walls, which I always knew. Renovations are grand,\" he says, boasting that contractors from the General Services Administration resurfaced the walls and redid the moldings in two days. \"Remember how hard they worked? They wanted to make me happy.\"\n\nTrump says he used his own money to pay for the enormous crystal chandelier that now hangs from the ceiling. \"I made a contribution to the White House,\" he jokes. But the thing he wants to show is on the opposite wall, above the fireplace, a new 60-plus-inch flat-screen television that he has cued up with clips from the day's Senate hearing on Russia. Since at least as far back as Richard Nixon, Presidents have kept televisions in this room, usually small ones, no larger than a bread box, tucked away on a sideboard shelf. That's not the Trump way.\n\nA clutch of aides follow him, including McMaster, Pence and press secretary Sean Spicer. The President raises a remote and flicks on the screen, sorting through old recordings of cable news shows, until he comes to what he is after: a clip from the Senate hearing earlier in the day, as broadcast on Fox News. The first clip he shows is of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham speaking to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Graham asks if Clapper stands by his statement that he knows of no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Trump waits quietly, until Clapper admits that nothing has changed. Trump pantomimes a sort of victory.\n\n\"Yes. He was choking on that,\" the President chortles. \"Is there any record at all of collusion? He was the head of the whole thing. He said no. That's a big statement.\" Trump leaves unmentioned the fact that there is an ongoing FBI counter­intelligence investigation into possible collusion, which has not yet reached any conclusions. Nor does he note that Clapper, out of government for nearly four months, could not possibly know everything the FBI has learned, and likely would have not known all even when he was in office. Trump also leaves unmentioned that he had a meeting that day with his new Deputy Attorney General about firing Comey, the director of that investigation.\n\nBut for now, Trump is focused on his TV. He watches the screen like a coach going over game tape, studying the opposition, plotting next week's plays. \"This is one of the great inventions of all time-TiVo,\" he says as he fast-forwards through the hearing.\n\nThe next clip starts to play, this time showing Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley asking Clapper and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates if they ever requested that the names of Trump, his associates or members of Congress be identified by name, or unmasked, in a legal intelligence intercept. \"Watch them start to choke like dogs,\" Trump says, having fun. \"Watch what happens. They are desperate for breath.\"\n\nClapper, on the screen, pauses several beats to search his memory. \"Ah, he's choking. Ah, look,\" the President says. After a delay, Clapper finally answers, admitting that he had requested an unmasking, which would have been a routine occurrence in his former job. The running Trump commentary continues. \"See the people in the back, people are gasping,\" he says, though it's unclear who he is referring to on the screen. He also mentions the sound of photographers' cameras clicking on the television.\n\nMoments later, the President watches as both Clapper and Yates testify that they had reviewed intercepts containing the unmasked identities of Trump, his associates and members of Congress. This, to Trump, is yet another victory, the lead-lined proof of his still unproven claim that Obama surveilled him before he was sworn in. \"So they surveilled me,\" he says. \"You guys don't write that-wiretapped in quotes. They surveilled me.\"\n\nPresident Trump walking to the residence\n\nThe powers of the presidency are vast, but Trump has discovered in these first months in office that they do not include­ much influence over how his words and actions are consumed by the American people. Among the many frustrations, none seems to burn quite as much as the disrespect he feels he has received from the press, which has steadily failed to reflect his version of reality. The story he wants told is not the one the nation reads and sees.\n\nIn his view, the past months have included a steady string of successes, broken only by occasional missteps, which are invariably overplayed and misinterpreted. After a rough start, an Obamacare replacement passed the House. A red line against the use of chemical weapons has been re-established in Syria. Political prisoners have been released from Egypt.\n\nChina has offered new cooperation to prevent the further development of North Korea's nuclear arsenal. American companies have been arm-twisted into staying in the country, while Trump has personally inserted himself into a handful of negotiations over weapons systems and trade agreements to try to get Americans a better deal.\n\nBut the turmoil of his presidency has so far dominated the headlines, pushing out much of what he considers to be the good news he thinks he deserves. The press has focused on the disruption; his false statements in office; the fear and dislocation in immigrant communities; the many campaign promises, from eliminating the export-import bank to declaring China a currency manipulator, on which Trump has equivocated.\n\nOf the many firestorms he has had to fight, none has burned as brightly as the tweets he sent accusing Obama of wiretapping him at Trump Tower. The head of the FBI, Comey, whom he had discussed firing earlier that day, had testified that there is no evidence that this happened. So he has been arguing that the wiretapping he alleged could include routine surveillance, which was not directed by the White House, of legal surveillance targets who spoke with people in his campaign. That's why he cares so much about the \"unmasking\" testimony. He seeks vindication.\n\nAn elevator in the private residence\n\n\"The truth is, I got a raw deal,\" he says later in the evening, the frustration unmistakable for a man who has spent so much of his life grading himself by headlines. The détente with the press after the election that he had hoped for never came. \"It's gotten worse,\" he says. \"It's one of the things that surprises me.\"\n\nTo cope with this new reality, the President says he is trying a mindfulness trick: he has tried to tune out the bad news about himself. \"I've been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I've been able not to watch or read things that aren't pleasant,\" he will say later in the night, listing off the networks he tries to tune out and the newspapers he struggles to skim. Of course, as his public outbursts indicate, he does not always succeed, but he says he no longer feels a need to know everything said about him. \"In terms of your own self, it's a very, very good thing,\" he says. \"The equilibrium is much better.\"\n\nThe following day, the news of the Senate hearings will once again fail to comport with the meaning he derived from his TiVo. The focus instead will be on Yates' description of how she warned the White House about the apparent duplicity of Trump's first National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, who misled the Vice President about his contacts with Russia. Flynn is now facing an investigation into foreign payments that officials say he failed to report.\n\nTrump can't do anything about that, for the most part. But he can still tweet. So now he walks out of his dining room, followed by the same substantial entourage of senior aides. Back in the Oval Office, he checks in with his waiting staff. \"Did you get that stuff out?\" the President asks of the tweets he had prepared. \"The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax,\" one reads, \"when will the taxpayer funded charade end?\" Dan Scavino, his social-media director, is sitting on the couch. \"Yes, sir. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter. It's everywhere,\" he says.\n\n\"The real story is the surveillance,\" the President responds, before ribbing his staff. \"But my comms people can't get it out.\" They start laughing. But there are even more pressing matters. Trump turns to McMaster, who was the subject of a column on Bloomberg earlier in the day, quoting anonymous sources saying the President was unhappy with his performance. It's another story that Trump declares false. The President thinks he knows where the leak is coming from, which provides some comfort. But for now, he will counterprogram: \"I'm so happy with him,\" Trump says. \"I think he's wonderful.\" And with that, he decides, it is time to go home.\n\nPresident Trump walks down the Grand Staircase\n\nAll Presidents must contain multitudes. But for Trump, the situation is, as usual, bigger, bolder and more complex. At core, he has always been a transactional person. That means he reacts, often in the moment, to the information and people around him. He comes to office with no well-formed ideology and with an evolving understanding of history and government, and a clear goal of using his business acumen to help his most fervent supporters. He is extremely confident in his own judgment, often willing to act alone, to take risks, even when those around him plead caution.\n\nDuring the campaign, this proved to be an enormous asset, allowing him to dispatch more than a dozen opponents and remake the rules of presidential politics. Life in the White House, he has found, is somewhat more restrictive, with far greater stakes. Escalating conflict, which works so well on the campaign trail, has not always yielded results now that he is governing. And at several points, he has had to absorb the fact that the President isn't all-powerful, with his orders blocked by the courts, his wish lists discarded by Congress, a steady stream of leaks from the intelligence community sparking turmoil in his Administration and a media that writes and broadcasts as it pleases.\n\nFrom the Oval Office, it's a 60-yard stroll down the sloped colonnade to the Palm Room doors that lead into his ­government-funded mansion. An elevator operator is waiting for him off the ground-floor hallway. \"Stop up at the second floor, would you?\" asks the President. Then he turns to his guests. \"Did you ever see the Lincoln Bedroom?\" The Vice President, who has walked over as well, takes the stairs. As a matter of protocol, to ensure continuity of government, the two men do not share the same airplane or ride the same lift.\n\nTrump has lived most of these first months alone in his upstairs palace, inhabiting 20,000 square feet of the residence by himself most weeknights, catered to by a household staff that totals nearly 100, including a couple of valets and a handful of butlers. During the Obama years, the second and third floors of the executive mansion were treated as private housing, not a governing space. Obama's daughters and mother-in-law lived in a few of the extra bedrooms. The first time most staff ever got to see the place was the night Obamacare passed in March 2010, when the Obamas decided to throw a party.\n\nThe current President has taken a different tack, inviting staff up regularly for meetings; hosting dinners for old friends, staff and supporters; giving tours; calling foreign leaders from Lincoln's old desk in the Treaty Room, where he will also stay late into the night doing work with his longtime personal aide and bodyguard Keith Schiller. \"The phone system is so amazing here,\" Trump confides as he enters the space. \"This one phone, it splits the words\"-a reference to scrambling technology meant to disrupt eavesdropping.\n\nThe space is far larger than it looks from outside, with a long great hall, appointed with freshly cut yellow flowers. \"This is the kitchen here, a beautiful kitchen,\" he says. \"This is the dining room. Here is a room where we have a guest room.\" Trump shows off the Presidential Seal over the closed door to his suite and the Yellow Oval Room, which opens out onto the Truman Balcony, where Trump's security detail has discouraged him from spending too much time.\n\nIt is the Lincoln Bedroom, however, that for him holds the most symbolic value, with its display of the Gettysburg Address. \"Isn't this incredible?\" Trump asks. \"He was very tall, and this bureau was built for him, with a tall mirror.\" If there is a pressure from the office that he feels in this building, this is where it manifests. The current President talks sympathetically about Lincoln's struggles, the death of his 11-year-old son in this building, the ghosts that haunted him afterward. \"He was a great genius, but he had some difficulty,\" Trump explains. \"He was very distressed after his son died. They say melancholy.\"\n\nBut this is not something to dwell on. A few moments later he is back downstairs, gazing at the East Room. Presidents from Bill Clinton to Harry Truman have joked that the White House was a sort of prison. He doesn't feel that way, he says. \"You have to be a certain type of person,\" he explains. \"People have no idea the beauty of the White House. The real beauty of the White House.\"\n\nThe President has been studying White House history as he puts his personal touch on the building\n\nIn about four weeks , Trump expects his wife and youngest son to join him in the mansion, and when they arrive, life is almost certain to change. But tonight, it's all business, and the Blue Room has been lit with nearly a dozen votive candles, the table is set with yellow roses, and the Washington Monument is neatly framed in the South window.\n\nThe waiters know well Trump's personal preferences. As he settles down, they bring him a Diet Coke, while the rest of us are served water, with the Vice President sitting at one end of the table. With the salad course, Trump is served what appears to be Thousand Island dressing instead of the creamy vinaigrette for his guests. When the chicken arrives, he is the only one given an extra dish of sauce. At the dessert course, he gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream with his chocolate cream pie, instead of the single scoop for everyone else. The tastes of Pence are also tended to. Instead of the pie, he gets a fruit plate.\n\nTrump sees the dinner with TIME as a pitch meeting as much as anything else, with an audience that he does not entirely trust. He wants to go through his many accomplishments, regularly deflecting questions to keep on task. \"The big story is that we are doing a good job for the country,\" the President says. \"We're cutting costs, big, big costs.\" He runs through the tales of his renegotiations with Lockheed and Boeing on the F-35 and F/A-18 Super Hornet fighters. He speaks of asking Apple's Tim Cook to build new manufacturing plants in the U.S. He talks of his plans to renegotiate any future military contracts to make sure they have fixed prices.\n\nAt length, he discusses the small details of military procurement, including the reasons why the more costly digital catapult systems on new aircraft carriers don't work as well as the old steam-driven systems. \"Time and material means you're going to get your ass kicked,\" he says of the common government contracting method, which often leads to cost overruns. \"Who ever heard of time and material?\" He marvels at the technology behind the cruise missiles he launched on an airfield in Syria, noting their ability to maneuver to destroy planes hiding under concrete shelters. He even brings up his efforts to ensure that an African leader, from a country he declines to name, can buy American military equipment despite decades-old human rights concerns.\n\nThe President often gives tours of the mansion to dinner guests\n\nThis is the part of the job that he has clearly come to enjoy, playing businessman for the American people. He brags about the close relationships he believes he has formed with foreign leaders, complimenting Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel on inviting his daughter Ivanka to speak overseas. He boasts of convincing Egypt's leader, General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, to release several political prisoners, including an American­. He even runs through the many ways he has revised the rules of engagement in the war on the Islamic State. \"They keep coming to me, at weird times too,\" he says of requests for approval for drone strikes and Special Forces raids in his earliest days in office.\n\nHis priority was ensuring that the military didn't wait long for the operations to commence. \"I authorized the generals to do the fighting,\" he says. Trump has shifted the authority for final approvals from the White House back to combatant commanders. Other Obama-era restrictions, like strict force-management levels in Syria, proscribing the number of troops or vehicles that can be used at any one time, have been relaxed. As a result, the reliance on foreign contractors to support U.S. forces has ebbed. He mentions the recent death of a high-ranking Islamic State fighter and promises more to come.\n\nAs the dinner goes on, he loosens up, but only a little. He admits a few small mistakes, including a misstep in the fight in the House to repeal Obamacare. \"There was a mistake. We set a date,\" he says of the first deadline by which he hoped to get a vote on the floor in mid-March. \"And when we didn't vote, everyone says, 'Trump fails on health care.'\"\n\nHe joins Pence in describing the hours he spent on the phone with dozens of lawmakers, cajoling them from no to yes. Asked if dealmaking is any different in Washington than in real estate or entertainment, he has a quick answer. \"It's always the same,\" he says. \"You have to know your subject.\"\n\nLeft: President Trump walks along the Colonnade. Right: Trump gives a thumbs up\n\nThen there are the emotional costs of the job, he says. He describes his visit last month to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, just outside of Washington, where he met with wounded service members from Iraq and Afghanistan, as \"incredible and terrible.\" He met one wounded warrior who lost his leg but is learning to walk again with a prosthesis. \"All he wants to do is go back. It's amazing,\" Trump says. \"The spirit is so incredible.\"\n\nAnd for the man who centered his campaign around the notion of \"America first,\" he explains that he is deeply moved by the violence against children in Syria, particularly Bashar Assad's use of chemical weapons on his people. \"I mean, when he actually said they were child actors, who would even think of that?\" Trump says with disgust of the young bodies that were shown on television. \"I felt something had to be done.\"\n\nIt would be wrong to say that the presidency has softened Trump. His willingness to fight is unabated and unfiltered. But he is no longer tethered to a one-way strategy of disruption and conflict. He is willing to back down at times, to adjust course. His chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, who has argued for a dark, generational clearing away of old institutions, found himself effectively demoted, though he remains an important player. On a wide variety of policy issues, Trump has edged toward the center, most notably allowing Congress to negotiate a spending bill that left out a number of his priorities.\n\nWhen asked directly if he feels his Administration has been too combative, he makes a brief allowance. \"It could be my fault,\" he says. \"I don't want to necessarily blame, but there's a great meanness out there that I'm surprised at.\" The inner conflict is clearly evident. This is the same man who just a couple hours earlier had joked about former federal officials choking \"like dogs.\"\n\nSome evenings, Trump works the phones from his residence before retiring for the night\n\nOne senior White House official recently outlined the three rules of Trump for a group of reporters: When you're right, you fight. Controversy elevates message. And never apologize. All of these rules have survived his time in office, if in slightly more modest forms. After bringing new levels of combativeness to the political process, \"the only way you survive is to be combative,\" Trump says now. \"I'll read stories in the New York Times that are so one-sided. Hey, I know when I am successful. I know victory.\"\n\nBut that is not all he has to say. Before the dinner breaks up, the President begins to muse about an alternative world to the one he has helped create. \"It never made sense to me, the level of animosity,\" Trump says. \"All you want to do is, like, Let's have a great military. Let's have low taxes. Let's have good health care. Let's have good education.\"\n\nFor a moment, he seems to be proposing a more civil public space in American democracy, one the Trump campaign did little to foster and which the Trump Administration is unlikely to experience.\n\nIs this real introspection or just more performance for his guests? The answer isn't long in coming. Within a day of the plates being cleared away, Trump takes to Twitter to attack \"Cryin' Chuck Schumer,\" the Democratic Senate leader. He belittles Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal for once misrepresenting his military service-\"he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness.\" No truce is around the corner. President Trump fights on.\n\nYour browser is out of date. Please update your browser at http://update.microsoft.com"

      "text": "BY MICHAEL SCHERER\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY NADAV KANDER FOR TIME\n\nEven for Donald Trump , the distance is still fun to think about, up here in his penthouse 600 ft. in the sky , where it's hard to make out the regular people below. The ice skaters swarming Central Park's Wollman Rink look like old-television static, and the Fifth Avenue holiday shoppers could be mites in a gutter. To even see this view, elevator operators, who spend their days standing in place, must push a button marked 66-68, announcing all three floors of Trump's princely pad . Inside, staff members wear cloth slipcovers on their shoes, so as not to scuff the shiny marble or stain the plush cream carpets.\n\nThis is, in short, not a natural place to refine the common touch. It's gilded and gaudy, a dreamscape of faded tapestry, antique clocks and fresco-style ceiling murals of gym-rat Greek gods. The throw pillows carry the Trump shield, and the paper napkins are monogrammed with the family name. His closest neighbors, at least at this altitude, are an international set of billionaire moguls who have decided to stash their money at One57 and 432 Park, the two newest skyscrapers to remake midtown Manhattan. There is no tight-knit community in the sky, no paperboy or postman, no bowling over brews after work.\n\nBehind TIME's Person of the Year Cover\n\nAnd yet here Trump resides, under dripping crystal, with diamond cuff links, as the President-elect of the United States of America. The Secret Service agents milling about prove that it really happened, this election result few saw coming. Hulking and serious, they gingerly try to stay on the marble, avoiding the carpets with their uncovered shoes. On his wife Melania's desk , next to books of Gianni Versace's fashions and Elizabeth Taylor's jewelry, a new volume sits front and center: The White House: Its Historic Furnishings and First Families .\n\nFor all of Trump's public life, tastemakers and intellectuals have dismissed him as a vulgarian and carnival barker, a showman with big flash and little substance. But what those critics never understood was that their disdain gave him strength. For years, he fed off the disrespect and used it to grab more tabloid headlines, to connect to common people. Now he has upended the leadership of both major political parties and effectively shifted the political direction of the international order. He will soon command history's most lethal military, along with economic levers that can change the lives of billions. And the people he has to thank are those he calls \"the forgotten,\" millions of American voters who get paid by the hour in shoes that will never touch these carpets-working folk, regular Janes and Joes, the dots in the distance.\n\nIt's a topic Trump wants to discuss as he settles down in his dining room, with its two-story ceiling and marble table the length of a horseshoe pitch: the winning margins he achieved in West Virginia coal country , the rally crowds that swelled on Election Day, what he calls that \"interesting thing,\" the contradiction at the core of his appeal. \"What amazes a lot of people is that I'm sitting in an apartment the likes of which nobody's ever seen,\" the next President says, smiling. \" And yet I represent the workers of the world.\"\n\nThe late Fidel Castro would probably spit out his cigar if he heard that one-a billionaire who branded excess claiming the slogans of the proletariat. But Trump doesn't care. \"I'm representing them, and they love me and I love them,\" he continues, talking about the people of Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the struggling Rust Belt necklace around the Great Lakes that delivered his victory. \"And here we sit, in very different circumstances.\"\n\nThe Last, Greatest Deal For nearly 17 months on the campaign trail, Trump did what no American politician had attempted in a generation, with defiant flair. Instead of painting a bright vision for a unified future, he magnified the divisions of the present, inspiring new levels of anger and fear within his country. Whatever you think of the man, this much is undeniable: he uncovered an opportunity others didn't believe existed, the last, greatest deal for a 21st century salesman. The national press, the late-night comics, the elected leaders, the donors, the corporate chiefs and a sitting President who prematurely dropped his mic-they all believed he was just taking the country for a ride.\n\nNow it's difficult to count all the ways Trump remade the game: the huckster came off more real than the scripted political pros. The cable-news addict made pollsters look like chumps. The fabulist out-shouted journalists fighting to separate fact from falsehood. The demagogue won more Latino and black votes than the 2012 Republican nominee.\n\nTrump found a way to woo white evangelicals by historic margins, even winning those who attend religious services every week. Despite boasting on video of sexually assaulting women, he still found a way to win white females by 9 points. As a champion of federal entitlements for the poor, tariffs on China and health care \"for everybody,\" he dominated among self-described conservatives. In a country that seemed to be bending toward its demographic future, with many straining to finally step outside the darker cycles of history, he proved that tribal instincts never die, that in times of economic strife and breakneck social change, a charismatic leader could still find the enemy within and rally the masses to his side. In the weeks after his victory, hundreds of incidents of harassment, many using his name-against women, Muslims, immigrants and racial minorities-were reported across the country.\n\nThe starting point for his success, which can be measured with just tens of thousands of votes, was the most obvious recipe in politics. He identified the central issue motivating the American electorate and then convinced a plurality of the voters in the states that mattered that he was the best person to bring change. \"The greatest jobs theft in the history of the world\" was his cause, \"I alone can fix it\" his unlikely selling point , \"great again\" his rallying cry.\n\nSince the bungled Iraq War faded into the rearview mirror, there has been only one defining issue in American presidential politics, spanning party and ideology. It's the reason Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren thunders that \"the system is rigged\" by the banks, and Vermont's Bernie Sanders got so much traction denouncing the greed of \"millionaires and billionaires.\" It's what Marco Rubio meant when he said, \"We are losing the American Dream,\" and why Jeb Bush claimed everyone has a \"right to rise.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama identified it early, back in 2005, as a newly elected Senator delivering a commencement speech at tiny Knox College in Galesburg, Ill. Obama's hymn to \"the forgotten\" was his ticket to the White House. \"You know what this new challenge is. You've seen it,\" he said. \"The fact that when you drive by the old Maytag plant around lunchtime, no one walks out anymore ... It's as if someone changed the rules in the middle of the game and no one bothered to tell these folks.\"\n\nAs Obama explained it, the American promise was being put up on cinder blocks, buttressed by massive economic forces. His vow, repeated in his final 30-minute-long television ad in 2008, was change for the struggling, help for those who needed it, security for the ones who felt themselves slipping. Four years later, he would return to the same playbook to defeat Mitt Romney, casting the Republican nominee as an obtuse private-equity moneybags aiming to bankrupt Detroit. A quote pulled from a focus group-\"I'm working harder and falling behind\"-became the watchwords of Obama's 2012 re-elect, hung on walls and placed atop PowerPoints. He had identified the issue, and as long as his name was on the ballot, no one could beat him.\n\nBut Obama never fully delivered the prosperity he promised. There was certainly help on the margins, slowing cost growth for health care and providing insurance to millions, for example. He started some pilot projects for manufacturing hubs, increased incomes marginally in the past couple of years and led the nation to recover from a vicious recession, with the federal government directly creating or saving millions of jobs. An unemployment rate that peaked at 10% in October 2009 has been halved to 4.6% now, at the end of his term. But the great weather systems of global change continued under his watch. Ultimately, he grew resigned to the fact that there was only so much he could do in office.\n\nThe most recently available data tells the remarkable story: between 2001 and 2012, the median incomes of households headed by people without college degrees-nearly two-thirds of all homes-fell as they aged, according to research by Robert Shapiro, an economist who advised Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. As American productivity and gross domestic product grew in the first decade of the new century, median wages for all Americans broke away, effectively flatlining. Most Americans making less than the median income, but not so little as to qualify for poverty benefits, suffered income losses of about 5% between 2007 and 2013, according to research by Branko Milanovic, a former World Bank economist.\n\nIf you lived in the nation's great cities or held a college degree, you probably didn't feel the full fury of these forces. Average income declines for top earners were closer to 1% during the postrecession years. Global change is tricky that way. It enriches those in the developed world who can handle bits and bytes, create something new or sell their work at a distance. And it elevates the fortunes of the global poor, largely in Asia, pushing about a billion people from poverty into the beginnings of a new China-led middle class.\n\nBut for the working men and women of developed countries, many of whom had made good livings in the 20th century, the price of others' success could be seen all around, in peeling house paint and closed storefronts, in towns that went belly-up when one of the two big employers closed shop. The pressures pushed across the Atlantic Ocean. The size of the middle classes, as measured by those who earn 25% above or below the median income, dropped in the U.S. from the 1980s to 2013. It also dropped in Spain and Germany, the Netherlands and the U.K. It is no accident that all those countries now find themselves in the midst of political upheaval as well.\n\nThe reasons for the shifts are more complex than the simple offshoring of manufacturing plants to Mexico or China. Global trade and new technology also pressure wages on jobs beyond the assembly line. When combined with rising health-insurance costs and incessant shareholder demands, companies found themselves unable or unwilling to give raises. Automation also accelerated as factories turned to robots, checkout lines retooled with self-operated terminals, and engineers developed self-driving trucks and taxis. Political gridlock in Washington, and the mild austerity it created, weighed everything down.\n\n'I hoped for change and never saw it' But properly diagnosing the problem doesn't help much if you live in a place that has taken it on the chin. In Shiawassee County, Michigan, which sits like a pit stop between Flint and Lansing, Obama won comfortably in 2008 and by a narrow margin in 2012. Then Trump tromped to victory this year with a 20-point margin. Rick Mengel, a 69-year-old retired pipe fitter, was one of the union members who voted for the young Illinois Senator in 2008, after seeing him promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Obama once called \"devastating\" and a \"big mistake.\"\n\n\"I hoped for change and never saw it,\" Mengel says of the Obama years. \"I watched jobs go away, and any jobs that came in were at McDonald's. I'm not knocking McDonald's, but it's a starter job. It doesn't make the car or house payments.\" When a friend bought him a MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN hat this year, Mengel took to wearing it everywhere he went. He never believed the polls that said Hillary Clinton would carry Michigan, because he can't remember ever sitting down with a group of five or six people and finding more than one for her. \"Hillary came along and she just never said what she was going to do,\" Mengel explains. \"She just talked bad about Trump.\"\n\nFirst he needed to define the bad guys. then he needed to knock them over.\n\nSuch voices were easy to find in central Michigan, northeast Pennsylvania and western Wisconsin in the days after the election. Here were historically Democratic counties that Obama had won twice, only to see Trump then win comfortably. They are mostly white parts of the country, with struggling Main Streets and low college-graduation rates, where the local beauty salons do better business than the car dealers. They are places where people start their life stories by recounting the good-paying jobs their grandparents held, or the long-gone second homes up on the lake where they used to play as kids. In the 1970s, the bumper stickers on trucks in Prairie du Chien, Wis., would read LIVE BETTER. WORK UNION . Now the sign in the local Walmart says, SAVE MONEY. LIVE BETTER.\n\nJoseph Dougherty, a former Democratic mayor of Nanticoke, Pa. who manages an automotive paint store, switched his voter registration this year for Trump. He was one of many in Luzerne County, a gorgeous river valley of rolling hills and former coal mines, who had lost patience. Trump cleared 78,000 votes in these hills, 20,000 more than Romney. \"The Democratic Party forgot about its base. It's all less for us and more for someone else,\" Dougherty said, explaining how he could betray the party he was born into. \"People are tired of surviving. People want to go on vacation, improve their home, get a better car, invest in their children's future.\"\n\nEconomists looking at the voting patterns since Election Day have been able to draw clear correlations between the local effects of international trade and voter angst. In counties where Chinese imports grew between 2002 and 2014, the vote for Trump increased over the vote George W. Bush won in 2000. For every percentage-point increase in imports, the economists found an average 2-point increase for the Republican nominee.\n\nIn some places, the shift was even steeper. In Branch County, Michigan, near the Indiana border, about halfway between Detroit and Chicago, a 3% increase in Chinese imports coincided with an 11% bump for Trump over Bush. The message of renewed protectionism, new tariffs and scrapped trade agreements broke through. \"His approach was much more visceral,\" says David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, who co-authored the study. \"He seemed to say, 'We don't have to adapt to globalization. We can reverse it.'\"\n\nIt's hard to find any trained economist who believes that's possible, at least in the terms Trump uses. The supply chains are too broadly dispersed, the pricing efficiencies too embedded in our lives, the robots too cost-effective. Then there are the dangers of massive disruption, the unquantifiable costs of trade wars, or the actual wars that could follow.\n\nBut Trump's improvement on Obama's sales pitch was never about the details. He communicated on a deeper level, something he has done all his life. His was not a campaign about the effects of tariffs on the price of batteries or basketball shoes. He spoke only of winning and losing, us and them, the strong and the weak. Trump is a student of the tabloids, a master of television. He had moonlighted as a professional wrestler. He knew how to win the crowd. First he needed to define the bad guys. Then he needed to knock them over.\n\nThe Presidency as Improv On Dec. 1, just weeks after his victory, Trump traveled to Indiana to announce that United Technologies, the 45th largest company in the country, had agreed to his demands and would retain 800 Carrier manufacturing jobs in Indianapolis. This mostly fulfilled a campaign promise he had made after the factory became national news when video shot inside showed the despair of workers discovering their work was headed to Mexico. \"Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences,\" he declared at the plant.\n\nThree days earlier, Trump met with TIME in his towering dining room. The Carrier deal was basically done, thanks to a mixture of $7 million in state tax breaks, presidential threats and promises of tax and regulatory reform. But it was still a secret. His running mate, former Indiana governor Mike Pence, declined to discuss the deal when a reporter ran into him in Trump's high-rise kitchen. But Trump could not stop himself. \"I'm going to give you this off the record,\" he said. \"You can use it if they announce.\"\n\nFor both conservative and liberal ideologues, including Sarah Palin and Bernie Sanders, the deal Trump struck with Carrier was an abomination, an example of government using taxpayer money to pick winners and losers. But as Trump told the story in his tower, ideology had nothing to do with it. This was just another tale of a little guy getting his voice heard.\n\n\"So the other night, I'm watching the news,\" Trump began. NBC's Lester Holt had introduced a segment on the Carrier plant featuring a union representative and a plant worker talking in a bar. The man looked at the camera and spoke to Trump, saying, \"We want you to do what you said you were going to do.\" Trump claimed this shocked him: \"I said, I never said they weren't going to move, to myself.\"\n\nBut of course he had, as the news segment demonstrated. So Trump says he had no choice. He had to listen to his people. \"He energized me, that man,\" the President-elect explained. \"And I called up the head of United Technologies.\"\n\nShortly after he spoke those words, Reince Priebus, the next White House chief of staff, walked into the room. With the tape recorders rolling, Trump began to issue new instructions. \"Hey, Reince, I want to get a list of companies that have announced they're leaving,\" he called out. \"I can call them myself. Five minutes apiece. They won't be leaving. O.K.?\"\n\nHe was talking as if he had just realized-at that moment, in the middle of an interview-that he had the power to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail. But it was just a show. At that point, Trump had already had a similar talk with Bill Ford of Ford Motor Co., and he boasted of putting out three other calls out to corporations with outsourcing plans.\n\nThis is the presidency as improv, as performance art, with good guys, bad guys and suspense. It's a new thing for the United States of America. The reporters in the room, the voters who will read this article, the nation, the world-we are the audience. A quick study who grew up in Kenosha, Wis., Priebus is far too Midwestern to be mistaken for a showman. But he got what Trump was trying to do, and smiled. \"It worked for you last time,\" he told the boss.\n\nMissing the Message History will record that Clinton foresaw the economic forces that allowed Trump to win. What she and her team never fully understood was the depth of the populism Trump was peddling, the idea that the elites were arrayed against regular people, and that he, the great man, the strong man, the offensive man, the disruptive man, the entertaining man, could remake the physics of an election.\n\n\"You cannot underestimate the role of the backlash against political correctness-the us vs. the elite,\" explains Kellyanne Conway, who worked as Trump's final campaign manager. His previous campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, put it somewhat more delicately: \"We always felt comfortable that when people were criticizing him for being so outspoken, the American voters were hearing him too.\"\n\nIn June 2015, Clinton's pollster Joel Benenson laid out the state of the country in a private memo to senior staff that was later released to the public by WikiLeaks. The picture of voters was much the same as the one he had described to Obama in 2008 and 2012. \"When they look to the future, they see growing obstacles, but nobody having their back,\" Benenson wrote. \"They can't keep up; they work hard but can't move ahead.\" The top priority he listed for voters was \"protecting American jobs here at home.\"\n\nThat message anchored the launch of Clinton's campaign, and it was woven through her three debate performances. But in the closing weeks, she shifted to something else. No presidential candidate in American history had done or said so many outlandish and offensive things as Trump. He cheered when protesters got hit at his rallies, used sexist insults for members of the press, argued that an American judge should be disqualified from a case because of his Mexican heritage. He would tell an allegory about Muslim refugees entering the U.S. that cast those families fleeing violence as venomous snakes, waiting to sink their fangs into \"tenderhearted\" women. And he would match those stories with bloody tales of undocumented immigrants from Mexico who murdered Americans in cold blood. \"His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous,\" Clinton argued.\n\nHis rhetoric had in fact opened up a new public square, where racists and misogynists could boast of their views and claim themselves validated. And to further enrage many Americans, Trump regularly peddled falsehoods, without offering any evidence, and then refused to back down from his claims. He promised to sue the dozen women who came forward to say they had been sexually mistreated by him over the years. He said he might not accept the outcome of the election if it did not go his way. He described a crime wave gripping the country based on a selective reading of statistics.\n\nFor a Clinton campaign aiming to re-create Obama's winning coalitions, all of this proved too large a target to pass up. Clinton had proved to be a subpar campaigner, so with the FBI restarting and reclosing a criminal investigation into her email habits, her closing message focused on a moral argument about Trump's character. \"Our core values are being tested in this election,\" she said in Philadelphia, the night before the election. \"We know enough about my opponent. We know who he is. The real question for us is what kind of country we want to be.\"\n\nThe strategy worked, in a way. Clinton got about 2.5 million more votes than Trump, and on Election Day, more than 6 in 10 voters told exit pollsters that Trump lacked the temperament for the job of President. But the strategy also placed Clinton too far away from the central issue in the nation: the steady decline of the American standard of living. She lost the places that mattered most. \"There's a difference for voters between what offends you and what affects you,\" Conway helpfully explained after it was over.\n\nStanley Greenberg, the opinion-research guru for Bill Clinton in 1992, put out a poll around Election Day and found clear evidence that Clinton's decision to divert her message from the economy in the final weeks cost her the decisive vote in the Rust Belt. \"The data does not support the idea that the white working class was inevitably lost,\" Greenberg wrote, \"until the Clinton campaign stopped talking about economic change and asked people to vote for unity, temperament and experience, and to continue on President Obama's progress.\" Interestingly, Greenberg said turnout among young, minority and unmarried female voters also decreased when the economic message Obama had used fell away.\n\nAnecdote, Not Analysis The irony of this conclusion is profound. By seeking to condemn the dark side of politics, Clinton's campaign may have accidently validated it. By believing in the myth that Obama's election represented a permanent shift for the nation, they proved it was ephemeral. In the end, Trump reveled in these denunciations, which helped him market to his core supporters his determination to smash the existing elite. After the election, Trump's campaign CEO Stephen Bannon-the former head of a website known for stirring racial animus and provoking liberal outrage-explained it simply. \"Darkness is good,\" he told the Hollywood Reporter .\n\nThis is the method of a demagogue. The more the elites denounced his transgressions, the more his growing movement felt validated. Shortly after the campaign, Trump tweeted that 3 million votes had been cast illegally on Nov. 8, a false claim for which he has offered no hard evidence. But when asked about it in his penthouse, he seems eager to talk about the controversy he stirred. \"I've seen many, many complaints,\" he says. \"Tremendous numbers of complaints.\"\n\nIn the dining room, a TIME reporter reads to Trump one of Obama's oft-stated quotes about trying to appeal to the country's better angels and to fight its tribal instincts. Trump promptly stops the interview in its tracks. The human brain is wired for anecdote, not analysis, and Trump's whole career is a testament to this insight. Even when his business failures mounted, he could always boast about the ratings of his hit reality show, The Apprentice, or that time he finished construction on the Wollman ice rink outside his window. \"So let me go upstairs for one second and get you one newspaper article,\" he says. \"Do you mind if I take a one-second break?\" And then he disappears into his living quarters above.\n\nHe returns a few minutes later with that morning's copy of Newsday , the Long Island tabloid. The front-page headline reads, \"EXTREMELY VIOLENT\" GANG FACTION, with an article about a surge of local crime by foreign-born assailants. His point, it seems, is that the world is zero-sum, full of the irredeemable killers that Obama's idealism fails to see. The details are more compelling than any big picture. \"They come from Central America. They're tougher than any people you've ever met,\" Trump says. \"They're killing and raping everybody out there. They're illegal. And they are finished.\"\n\nA reporter mentions that what Trump is saying echoes the rhetoric of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who has overseen the extrajudicial killing of thousands of alleged drug dealers and users in recent months. The President-elect offers no objection to the comparison. \"Well, hey, look, this is bad stuff,\" he says. \"They slice them up, they carve their initials in the girl's forehead, O.K. What are we supposed to do? Be nice about it?\"\n\nDays later, Trump will have a phone call with the Philippine President, who called President Obama the \"son of a whore\" a few months ago. A readout from the Philippine government subsequently announces that during the call, Trump praised Duterte's deadly drug crackdown as \"the right way.\"\n\nPopulism Takes Center Stage A year from now, when Trump travels to the U.N. to address the world's leaders, he is likely to find far more sympathy for this hard-edged populism than any thought possible in 2008. Trump is all but rooting for it. \"People are proud of their countries, and I think you will see nationalism,\" he says, before describing the growing backlash against Muslim migration in France, Belgium and Germany. \"A lot of people reject some of the ideas that are being forced on them. And that's certainly one of the reasons you had this vote, having to do not with the European Union but the same thing.\"\n\nIn this view, Trump will find common cause with Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian President of Russia who, like Trump, seeks to challenge diplomatic and democratic norms. For reasons that remain unclear, Trump still refuses to acknowledge the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Putin's agencies were responsible for stealing the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails released on WikiLeaks. \"I don't believe it. I don't believe they interfered,\" Trump says. Asked if he thought the conclusion of America's spies was politically driven, Trump says, \"I think so.\" Since the election, Trump has chosen not to consistently make himself available for intelligence briefings, say aides.\n\nHe has also so far refused to acknowledge established diplomatic boundaries. When the Pakistani government gave a long, apparently verbatim readout of its President's call with Trump, India's leaders reacted with strained nerves. Then Trump accepted a phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, intentionally discarding a policy enforced since Jimmy Carter, which prompted an official complaint from China. In response, he sent out a tweet suggesting that such formalities, a bow to Chinese sensibilities, were ridiculous. \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call,\" it read.\n\nAs he proved in the campaign, there are sometimes few negative consequences in politics for offending or painting a false picture of reality. History suggests the same is less true in international relations, where the stakes are not just votes at the ballot box but also the movement of armies and the lives of citizens. Among the tight circle that has formed around Trump, one can sense some unease as they try to navigate a mercurial boss to a successful first term. There is talk of strategies for steering him when he is wrong, for appealing to his own intention to succeed. And Trump himself, true to his reality-show persona, has a history of allowing his staff to fight among themselves for his attention. \"If I had to describe his deliberating style, I would say that it's very similar to Socratic method, just like in law school,\" explains Priebus. \"He asks a lot of questions, he wants answers to those questions to be thorough and quick, and he relies on the people giving him the answers to be accurate.\"\n\nJust a day earlier, Conway had gone on television to suggest that picking Romney, an old Trump foe, for Secretary of State was a terrible idea. Some Trump aides told reporters that this amounted to a betrayal of the boss, who had not yet made up his mind. Trump seemed to enjoy the spectacle. \"I might not like it, but I thought it was fine,\" he says at the dining-room table. \"Otherwise I would have called her up.\"\n\nAt the same time, Trump has tried to curtail some of his own bravado since the campaign. The day after the election, Priebus says, Trump told his aides in his apartment, \"Guys, I'm for everybody in this country.\" Last year, Trump boasted about the great instincts that led him to support forced deportation for all undocumented immigrants and a ban on Muslims from entering the country. He has since backed off both positions. \"I mean, I've had some bad moments in the campaign,\" he says. But then he notes that his poll numbers seemed to rise after several of them, including his insults of Arizona Senator John McCain's war service.\n\nTrump claims that his unpredictability will be his strength in office. It certainly has left the political world guessing. He has so far refused to describe how he will separate himself from the conflict of owning a company and employing his children who do regular business with foreigners. On the one hand, he supports a broad policy platform shared by conservatives in Congress: a reduction in regulations, lower taxes, a pull back from the fight against global warming, and a cabinet filled with free-market ideologues. On the other hand, he has signaled that he is willing to break from Republican doctrine. His designated Treasury Secretary, the former Goldman Sachs banker Steve Mnuchin, has said Trump would back off his campaign suggestion that he would give large net tax windfalls to the wealthiest. \"Any reductions we have in upper-income taxes will be offset by less deductions,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nWhile Trump offered public words of support for the Iraq War at the time, he sees George W. Bush's great adventure as a disaster now. He rejects wholesale the social conservative campaign to keep transgender people out of the bathrooms they choose, but promises to reward conservative ideologues with a Supreme Court Justice of their liking. And he has little patience for the organizing principle of the Tea Party: the idea that the federal government must live within its means and lower its debts. Instead, he seems to favor expensive new infrastructure spending and tax cuts as economic stimulus, much like Obama did in 2009. \"Well, sometimes you have to prime the pump,\" he says. \"So sometimes in order to get jobs going and the country going, because, look, we're at 1% growth.\" The next day, the third-quarter gross-domestic-product estimates would be released, showing an increase of 3.2%, up from 1.4% earlier in the year.\n\nHe also suggests that some stock analysts may have misread his intentions. The value of biotechnology stocks, for example, which enjoy large profit margins under current law, rose 9% in the day after Trump's election, a rally of relief that the price controls Clinton had proposed would not happen. But Trump says his goal has not wavered. \"I'm going to bring down drug prices,\" he says. \"I don't like what has happened with drug prices.\"\n\nAs for the people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as youths and now have work visas under Obama, Trump did not back off his pledge to end Obama's executive orders. But he made clear he would like to find some future accommodation for them. \"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud,\" he says, showing a sympathy for young migrants that was often absent during the campaign. \"They got brought here at a very young age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in never-never land because they don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nTrump's America, for Better and Worse The truth is no one really knows what is going to happen, up to and including the occupants of Trump Tower. \"It's a very exciting time. It's really been an amazing time,\" Trump says, as the country still tries to come to terms with what he accomplished. \"Hopefully we can take some of the drama out.\"\n\nThat's not likely to happen anytime soon. Following a President who prided himself on sifting drama through the sieve of careful consideration, Trump's methods, for better and worse, tend to be closer to the opposite. And this is now Trump's America to run, a victory made possible either because of historical inevitability or individual brilliance, or some combination of the two.\n\nIt's an America with rising stock markets despite the tremors of a trade war. A country where a few jobs saved makes up, in the moment, for the thousands still departing. This is a land where a man will stand up in a plane headed to Allentown, Pa., to demand allegiance to the new leader-\"We got some Hillary bitches on here? Come on man, Trump! He's your President, every goddamn one of you!\"-and then get banned by the airline from ever traveling again. It's where a hijab-wearing college student in New York reports being attacked and jeered at in the next President's name, where American-born children ask their citizen parents if Trump will deport them, where white supremacists throw out Nazi salutes in Washington meeting halls for their President-elect.\n\nIt's a country where many who felt powerless have a new champion, where much frustration has given way to excitement and where politics has become the greatest show on earth. Here men in combat helmets and military assault rifles now patrol the streets outside a golden residential tower in midtown Manhattan. And almost every day at about the same time they let pass a street performer who wears no pants, tight white underwear and cowboy boots, so he can sing a song in the lobby for the television cameras with Trump's name written in red and blue on his butt. It's an America of renewed hope and paralyzing fear, a country few expected less than a year ago. Because of Donald John Trump, whatever happens next, it will never be like it was before.\n\n- With reporting by Zeke J.

      "text": "Read the Full Transcript of Donald Trump's 2024 Person of the Year Interview With TIME\n\nP resident-elect Donald Trump, TIME's 2024 Person of the Year , sat down for a wide-ranging interview at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., on Nov. 25.\n\nOver the course of the interview, Trump discussed his election victory , the economy , and the situations in Ukraine and the Middle East. He also spoke about his plans for a second term, including deporting millions of migrants and pardoning Jan. 6 defendants, as well as the future of the MAGA movement.\n\nTIME: You had an extraordinary year. You lived it and you know it. You cleared the field in the Republican campaign. You spent part of your campaign in a courtroom. You were almost shot to death on the trail. Your opponent dropped out, and then you won the swing states, which many people did not expect. What's one thing that we should know about your experience this year that we don't know?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think we ran a flawless campaign. It was, it was really quite something. I called it 72 Days of Fury. There were no days off. There were no timeouts. If you made a mistake, it would be magnified at levels that nobody's ever seen before. So you couldn't make a mistake. And I think we just really ran well. It was a drive to go through it. It started 72 days out. For some reason, it just seemed to be it. And I worked very hard. I've been, I've been given credit by, actually, the reporters that followed me, because it was, you know, just, it just was all the time, every day, and we said the right things. We said things that were on the minds of the country. I think the Democrats didn't get it. They just kept going back to the same old nonsense. And it was nonsense, especially in where we are right now. And we hit-we hit something that was very special. We hit the nerve of the country. They don't want to see jails emptied out into our country. They don't want to see people from mental institutions being dismissed from their institutions.\n\nMr. President, what did the Democrats not get? You just said \"they didn't get it.\" What did you mean by that?\n\nI don't think they got the feel of the country. The country was angry because of immigration, because of the people, you know, millions and millions of people. I was saying it could be 21 million people . They were saying a much lesser number, but it wasn't a much lesser number. But even if it was, it was irrelevant, because it was-they were allowing anybody to come into our country. They are right now. They opened it up again. You see what's going on? They're coming. They're pouring up through Mexico and other places. And they weren't using common sense. I said, We've become the party of common sense. As an example, they really don't want to see men playing in women's sports. You can have a-and this is one: They don't want to see, as another example, open borders. They want to see people come in. Everyone's okay with it, and I am certainly. I want to have a lot of people coming, because we're going to, we're going to bring back a lot of jobs. We'll bring record numbers of jobs, and we'll do it through good taxing policy, and, you know, using some basic business intelligence. But we're going to bring back record jobs. Record companies are going to come into our country. They're not going to be able to be able to steal our companies anymore. And I talked about that, but I differed, maybe, perhaps, from you people, I thought the economy was a big factor, especially the real economy, which is the economy of going out and buying groceries or buying a car or buying a house, which was, you know, between interest rates and between costs-as an example, the cost of a house is-a big chunk of the cost of the house is just the approval process and the regulations.\n\nThe economy was certainly a big factor in your victory-\n\nBut what was a bigger factor, I believe, was the border. I think the border and, you know, I won it in 2016 on the border, and I fixed the border , and it was really fixed, and they came in and they just dislodged everything that I did, and it became far worse than it was in 2016-\n\nI want to come back to immigration a little bit later. Let's start out on what's happening right now. You were elected on a promise to change Washington. By all accounts, the fight over that has already begun. One of your nominees was effectively blocked by the Senate. There are other senators who have expressed doubts about some of your other nominees. What are you going to do if the Senate continues to balk at your choices for these key cabinet positions?\n\nWell, I don't think they will. And he wasn't blocked. I had the votes if I needed them, but I had to work very hard. And you know, I'm not-there were numerous hard no's, all of whom agreed with me to do it.\n\nSo you decided to give up on Gaetz?\n\nNo, I didn't give up on him. I talked to him, and I said, you know, Matt, I don't think this is worth the fight. I had the-he was there when I convinced five people to go that were hard no's, but we want to speak to the President. And the beauty is that we won by so much. The mandate was massive. Somebody had 129 years in terms of the overall mandate . That's a lot of years, but people respected that. As an example, many places were thinking that they could go down and they could riot, make trouble, protest, on the election night. You know what happened? When the numbers started coming in, everyone just left. They left. I mean, you see signs of it, Washington, DC, where people were gathered.\n\nDid I hear you say that you met in person with Gaetz and the five hard-no Senators?\n\nNot with the senators there. No, I called the senators, and my relationship with the Senate is very good. Many of them I endorsed. Many of them I got elected. If I didn't get involved in those races, those Senators would have lost. We wouldn't have the majority.\n\nMr. President, will you use recess appointments to fill vacancies if you can't get them through?\n\nI really don't care how they get them approved, as long as they get them approved.\n\nSo you might do it?\n\nIt's up to the Senate. But I think I have a very good relationship with Senator Thune and the others, all of them. I think almost, almost everybody, many of them I was very instrumental in getting, if not this season, last season, the season before that, I would say more than half.\n\nWill you commit to honoring the Senate's authority to reject or confirm your nominees?\n\nWell, sure, I want them to do that. I think-I don't think there are too many. I don't think that- look, everybody has, that's why they have menus in restaurants. You have different choices. Some people love certain candidates. I'll tell you, I put up some that I thought would be a little more controversial, and they turned out not to be necessarily the ones that are controversial.\n\nOne of them who is controversial, who I just want to ask you a quick question about, is RFK Jr, who is a noted vaccine skeptic. If he moves to end childhood vaccination programs, would you sign off on that?\n\nWe're going to have a big discussion. The autism rate is at a level that nobody ever believed possible. If you look at things that are happening, there's something causing it.\n\nDo you think it's linked to vaccines?\n\nNo, I'm going to be listening to Bobby, who I've really gotten along with great and I have a lot of respect for having to do with food, having to do with vaccinations. He does not disagree with vaccinations, all vaccinations. He disagrees probably with some. But we'll have it. We're going to do what's good for the country.\n\nSo that could include getting rid of some vaccinations?\n\nIt could if I think it's dangerous, if I think they are not beneficial, but I don't think it's going to be very controversial in the end.\n\nDo you agree with him about the connection between vaccines and autism?\n\nI want to see the numbers. It's going to be the numbers. We will be able to do-I think you're going to feel very good about it at the end. We're going to be able to do very serious testing, and we'll see the numbers. A lot of people think a lot of different things. And at the end of the studies that we're doing, and we're going all out, we're going to know what's good and what's not good. We will know for sure what's good and what's not good.\n\nMr. President, some foreign officials have expressed concern about sharing intelligence with Tulsi Gabbard, given her positions in support of Russia and Syria. Would her confirmation be worth the price of some of our allies not sharing intelligence with us?\n\nI'm surprised to hear it, because I think she's, like, a really great American. Hey, look, they said I was friendly with Russia until they saw the tapes, and then they said, you know, he's not actually. He was the one that ended the Russian pipeline, Nord Stream 2. He was the one that put all the sanctions on Russia. And I get along with Russia. I get along with a lot of people that people would think I wouldn't get along with, but we get our way because I'm for this country, I'm not for other countries. By the way, do you want hors d'Oeuvres or anything?\n\nNo, that's generous, thank you.\n\nYou sure?\n\nYes, but thank you. If you learn that foreign officials are withholding intelligence because she is the head of your intelligence, would that change your calculus?\n\nI don't know. I'm surprised to hear it. I heard that the first time the other day. I mean, I think she's a great American. I think she's a person with tremendous common sense. I've watched her for years, and she has nothing to do with Russia. This is another, you know, a mini Russia, Russia, Russia scam. I think probably, if that's what's happening. No, I don't see it. Certainly, if something can be shown to me.\n\nDuring the campaign, you disavowed Project 2025, but so far at least five people you've appointed to top positions in your cabinet have ties to it. Doesn't that undermine what you told Americans on the campaign trail?\n\nNo look, I don't-I don't disagree with everything in Project 2025, but I disagree with some things. I specifically didn't want to read it because it wasn't under my auspices, and I wanted to be able to say that, you know, the only way I can say I have nothing to do with it is if you don't read it. I don't want-I didn't want to read it. I read enough about it. They have some things that are very conservative and very good. They have other things that I don't like. I won't go into individual items, but I had nothing to do with Project 2025. Now, if we had a few people that were involved, they had hundreds of them. This is a big document, from what I understand.\n\nMore than 800 pages.\n\nIt's a lot of pages. That's a lot of pages. I thought it was inappropriate that they came out with it just before the election, to be honest with you.\n\nReally?\n\nI let them know, yeah, I didn't think it was appropriate, because it's not me. Why would they do that? They complicated my election by doing it because people tried to tie me and I didn't agree with everything in there, and some things I vehemently disagreed with, and I thought it was inappropriate that they would come out with a document like that prior to my election.\n\nDid you express those frustrations with them?\n\nOh I did. It wasn't a frustration, it was a fact. It's totally inappropriate. They come up with an 800-page document, and the enemy, which is, you know, the other party, is allowed to go through and pick out two items, 12 items out of, you know, 800. No, I thought it was an open-I thought it was a very foolish thing for them to do.\n\nI understand, sir.\n\nThese are people that would like to see me win. And yet, they came out with this document, and they had some pretty ridiculous things in there. They also had some very good things in there.\n\nI understand, sir. Let's shift to a topic that I know you care quite a bit about: immigration. You recently said on Truth Social that you plan to use the military to deport migrants. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. What will you do if the military does not or refuses to carry out your orders?\n\nWell, it doesn't, it doesn't stop the military if it's an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country. We have criminals coming into our countries that we've never seen, we've never seen before. We have people coming in at levels and at record numbers that we've never seen before. And I'll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows. And I think in many cases, the sheriffs and law enforcement is going to need help. We'll also get National Guard. We'll get National Guard, and we'll go as far as I'm allowed to go, according to the laws of our country.\n\nIf you can't negotiate agreements with the receiving governments, and none seem receptive, will you of necessity have to hold these detained migrants in camps?\n\nI'll get them into every country, I'll get them into every country, or we won't do business with those countries.\n\nSo you won't need to build more detention facilities, sir?\n\nNo, because, look, we may have to do it anyway. Because, look, they brought in millions of people, and many of those people have been, you know, taken out of jails and prisons. You look at prison populations, what's happening all over the world, except here. No, they-I can't even conceive of why they would allow criminals, known criminals, people from jails that have tremendous records. Look, if you look at the 13,000-plus, 13,099 which was issued by border patrol, they said those people were murderers, and they allowed them into our country. Why would somebody do that? Why would somebody do that? And that's why the Democrats lost, because of many things like that. That's a bad one, by the way. You know that's a bad one, but there are many things that-\n\nSo you're saying there won't be new camps, more camps to hold detained migrants?\n\nWell, there might be. Whatever it takes to get them out. I don't care. Honestly, whatever it takes to get them out. Again, I'll do it absolutely within the confines of the law, but if it needs new camps, but I hope we're not going to need too many because I want to get them out, and I don't want them sitting in camp for the next 20 years. I want them out, and the countries have got to take them back, and if they don't take them back, we won't do business with those countries, and we will tariff those countries very substantially. When they send products in, they will have substantial tariffs, and it's going to make it very hard for them to do business with us.\n\nA question on the minds of a lot of Americans: Will you restore your policy of separating families?\n\nI don't think-I won't have to, because, first of all, it wasn't my policy. It was Obama's policy. I didn't build jail cells for children. He did. If you look at the 2014-\n\nI don't want to litigate the past. I'm just asking if you will do this-\n\nWell you said, your policy. This was a policy of the country. I don't believe we'll have to, because we will send the whole family back to the country.\n\nDeport them together?\n\nI would much rather deport them together, yes, than separate. By the way, when you talk about separation, we have 325,000 children here during Democrats-and this was done by Democrats-who are right now slaves, sex slaves or dead, and they were allowed. So I mean, those are the and what I will be doing will be trying to find where they are and get them back to their parents.\n\nMany of the people who voted for you, as you mentioned a moment ago, cited high prices, particularly of food and groceries. If you deport millions of migrant agricultural workers, won't the price of food rise sharply?\n\nNo, because we're going to let people in, but we have to let them in legally. We don't want people to come in from jails. We don't want the jails of Venezuela and many other countries, and not just South American countries. We don't want the jails to be opened up into our country. We're not accepting their prisoners. We're not accepting their murders. We're not accepting their people from mental institutions. We're not doing it.\n\nYour transition co-chair Howard Lutnick said your appointees would be vetted for loyalty. Are you going to ask your appointees to take a loyalty pledge?\n\nI don't think I'll have to. I think I will know who-I mean, look, all you can do is feel comfortable with people. There's always disloyal people, and every President's had them. I've had them, and every President has had them. But no, I think, I think I will be able to, for the most part, determine who's loyal. I want them to be loyal as to policy, as to the country. It's gotta be loyal.\n\nIf they don't follow your orders, will you fire them?\n\nIf I think it's appropriate, I'd fire them.\n\nDoes that go for civil servants as well, Mr. President, who work in the executive branch but aren't appointees?\n\nWell, it depends. We have some interesting things happening in rules and regulations, but we're going to see. But sure, if I'm allowed to do that, I would do that. If they're not following my policies, absolutely.\n\nYou've put Elon Musk in charge of DOGE, giving him the power to-\n\nAlong with-\n\nAlong with Vivek Ramaswamy, yes, absolutely. But on Musk specifically, giving him the power to oversee the agencies that regulate his companies. Isn't that a conflict of interest?\n\nI don't think so. Look, we have a country that is bloated with rules, regulations and with, frankly, people that are unnecessary to do. We are going to need a lot of people in a lot of other jobs. We're looking to get people into private sector jobs where they can do better and be more productive. We're going to see what happens. We have some interesting months coming up, at the beginning. We're going to see what happens. But this country is bloated.\n\nI think everybody agrees that there's waste in the federal government-\n\nWaste, fraud, and abuse.\n\nBut Elon Musk is talking about cuts that would directly affect NASA, which would then directly affect SpaceX, his company. Isn't that the textbook definition of a conflict of interest?\n\nI think that Elon puts the country long before his company. I mean, he's in a lot of companies, but he really is, and I've seen it. He considers this to be his most important project, and he wanted to do it. And, you know, I think, I think he's one of the very few people that would have the credibility to do it, but he puts the country before, and I've seen it, before he puts his company.\n\nWell, ultimately, Congress controls spending. Would you veto a budget or appropriations that does not comply with the Musk-Ramaswamy Commission, DOGE?\n\nI might. But there are many things you can do without Congress. When it comes to cutting, harder to get, but to cut, you can do a lot of things without Congress.\n\nWhat do you plan to do?\n\nI mean, I'll give you an example. We want to move the schools back to the states. We want to, you know, we're at the bottom of every list in terms of education, and we're at the top of the list in terms of the cost per pupil, and we want to move them back to the states, and we'll spend half the money on a much better product. We'll get-I believe we can compete with Norway and Denmark and Finland and other countries. And I will tell you, China is right at the top of the list too. Most lists.\n\nWhat does moving back to the states mean? Does that mean closing the Education Department?\n\nA virtual closure of Department of Education in Washington.\n\nVirtual closure?\n\nWell, you're going to need some people just to make sure they're teaching English in the schools. Okay, you know English and mathematics, let's say. But we want to move education back to the states. If you look at the states, if you look at some of the individual countries, Norway is a very strong educational country, but many. I think Iowa, and I think Indiana, and a lot of these states that are well-run states. We have a lot of them that are very well run. When they run their own educational program, I think it's going to, I think they'll be able to compete with anybody. Then you're going to have the badly run states, like a guy like Gavin Newscum [sic] in California, where he does a poor job, and he'll, but even in California, you'll give it to Riverside. You'll give it, you know, you'll give it to areas of California where I think they'll run a great school program.\n\nLast question on your transition, why have you declined to sign the ethics agreement as part of-\n\nI don't know anything about it.\n\nThe ethics document.\n\nI don't know. I would sign an ethics document.\n\nWill you disclose who the donors are to your transition?\n\nTo my campaign?\n\nNo-to paying for the transition.\n\nTaylor Budowich: There will be an announcement on that this week.\n\nI really, I have no problem disclosing anything.\n\nThat's great, Mr. President.\n\nJust so you know. I had heard this a couple of days ago. I have no problem. I'd rather disclose it right up front. I have no problem with it.\n\nI've got a question for you about the campaign. Was there a moment when you thought you might lose?\n\nI like not to think of that. The power of positive thinking, right? But there were some moments when, you know, there was, there was some bad things done in the campaign. There were a lot of fake polls. They were absolutely fake. Look at an example, a very good pollster was in Iowa, and I thought I was winning at the end. But it wasn't like she was a bad-she was great. For years, she was the best. She was the gold standard in Iowa. And then a couple of weeks before the election, she had me up four, and that brought it down way below the 18 or 19 that we thought we were, we were up with 18 or 19 points, which is, you know what I get, the farmers like me, but she did it in gradual steps. She did it up four. That was a big story, because I was only up four and then she did where I was down three, and that became headlines all over the place just before the election.\n\nWhen you saw that, did you think you were going to lose?\n\nI thought it was a wrong poll, because we had an Emerson poll that had us up 18 , you know.\n\nWhat was the darkest moment for you then in the campaign?\n\nBy the way, I'm just using that as an example. I didn't think I was going to lose. I thought it was a dishonest poll, and we're going to probably prove that because, you know, we're taking people to court because we think, I think, we have an obligation to. When 60 minutes interviews my opponent, and that's a news program, that's their most important news program, and she gave a really horrible answer. That was a bad answer. And they took that answer and replaced it , and this is her speaking, and they replaced it with another answer from a half an hour later in the interview that had nothing to do, but it was a much better answer. That's really dishonest.\n\nSpeaking of Kamala Harris. What do you think were her worst mistakes in the campaign?\n\nTaking the assignment. Number one, because you have to know what you're good at.\n\nDid she make any tactical mistakes you think that cost her?\n\nI think that when she wouldn't talk to anybody, it shone a light on her. In other words, if she would have gone out and just did interviews where they're comparable to Steve, if there is anybody comparable, would say, could you do an interview here? An interview there? You know, she didn't do anything. And people said, Is there something wrong with her? Why would they? I mean, I'm doing this interview with you. I did interviews with, if I had the time, anybody that would ask, I'd do interviews. I think the Joe Rogan interview, you know, that went on for almost three and a half hours.\n\nI watched the whole thing, sir, yes.\n\nOh good, I hope you liked it. But I found it to be a pleasure to do it, you know. He was an interesting guy. I wish I could have even done it longer. I had a rally that I was two and a half hours late for in Michigan. It was very cold. And, you know, we didn't lose anybody. But I explained to him, Listen, I just did an interview. We got to win this thing and-but I was two and a half hours late. I didn't know it was going to be three. I thought it was going to be an hour or something.\n\nYou had to wrap it up at the end.\n\nI had to say, listen, I have a rally where you have thousands of people that are standing. I think one of the big advantages I had is the rallies. I think, you know, nobody else gets the people we had. We had the biggest rallies. Nobody's ever seen rallies like that, and they were enthusiastic rallies. And when you see that, and then somebody else comes to town the following day, and they have a few hundred people, you would say, you have a big advantage. But, but it's an interesting question when you ask about her. I think they made a big tactical mistake by literally not talking to the press, even if a really friendly, I mean, and they had almost all friendly, somebody would come up with a really friendly-like you guys, maybe-but a friendly interview, and they turned everybody down. They wouldn't do the basic. And people, including me, would start to say, is there something wrong with her? What's wrong? Why wouldn't you do some basic interviews? And then she had some pretty failed interviews, and maybe it was highlighted more than it would. In other words, if she did those same interviews, but she did another 15 interviews, you know, you wouldn't have really noticed it that much.\n\nThe bad ones would have been drained out.\n\nShe put so much emphasis on interviews. Somebody thought there was something wrong, and I don't think she ever recovered from that.\n\nI'm going to shift to foreign policy. Have you spoken to Vladimir Putin since your election?\n\nI can't tell you. I can't tell you. It's just inappropriate.\n\nIf Ukraine doesn't agree to a peace deal that you have said you will broker, will you cut military, humanitarian, and intelligence assistance to them?\n\nThe reason that I don't like to tell you this is that, as a negotiator, when I sit down and talk to some very brilliant young people: young, young, young, young. Compared to me, you're very young. But when I talk to people-when I start I think I have a very good plan to help, but when I start exposing that plan, it becomes almost a worthless plan.\n\nWill you commit to protecting Ukrainian sovereignty, though, from Russia?\n\nI would like to see Ukraine-okay, ready? You have to go back a little bit further. It would have never happened if I were president. Would have never happened-\n\nBut it has happened. So the question people want to know is, Would you abandon Ukraine?\n\nIt makes it so bad. And I had a meeting recently with a group of people from the government, where they come in and brief me, and I'm not speaking out of turn, the numbers of dead soldiers that have been killed in the last month are numbers that are staggering, both Russians and Ukrainians, and the amounts are fairly equal. You know, I know they like to say they weren't, but they're fairly equal, but the numbers of dead young soldiers lying on fields all over the place are staggering. It's crazy what's taking place. It's crazy. I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that? We're just escalating this war and making it worse. That should not have been allowed to be done. Now they're doing not only missiles, but they're doing other types of weapons. And I think that's a very big mistake, very big mistake. But the level, the number of people dying is number one, not sustainable, and I'm talking on both sides. It's really an advantage to both sides to get this thing done.\n\nThe question that many Americans and many people around the world have is, Will you abandon Ukraine?\n\nI want to reach an agreement, and the only way you're going to reach an agreement is not to abandon. You understand what that means, right?\n\nRight. Well, no, tell me.\n\nWell, I just said it. You can't reach an agreement if you abandon, in my opinion. And I disagree with the whole thing, because it should have never happened. Putin would have never invaded Ukraine if I were president for numerous reasons. Number one, they drove up the oil price. When they drove up the oil price, they made it a profit-making situation for him, the oil price should have been driven down. If it was driven down, you wouldn't have had it wouldn't have started just for pure economic reasons. But when it hits $80, $85, and $90 a barrel. I mean, he made, he made a lot of money. I'm not saying it's a good thing, because he's also suffered, but they are moving forward. You know, this is a war that's been-this is a tragedy. This is death that's far greater than anyone knows. When the real numbers come out, you're going to see numbers that you're not going to believe.\n\nWell, another war with a high death toll is happening in the Middle East. You reportedly told Prime Minister Netanyahu that you wanted him to end the war in Gaza before you took office. What did he say?\n\nI think that, before I talk about that, I think that the Middle East is an easier problem to handle than what's happening with Russia and Ukraine. Okay, I just want to say that up front. The Middle East is going to get solved. The Middle East has been-it's a horrible thing. October 7 was a horrible thing. Everyone is forgetting conveniently about October 7, but that was a horrible day for the world, not for Israel, for the world. And I think the Middle East is going to get-as we speak, things are happening very productively on the Middle East. I think the Middle East is going to get solved. I think it's more complicated than the Russia-Ukraine, but I think it's, it's, it's easier to solve.\n\nDid Netanyahu give you assurances about when he would end the war?\n\nUm, I don't want to say that, but I think he feels confident that-I think he feels very confident in me, and I think he knows I want it to end. I want everything to end. I want, I don't want people killed, you know? I don't want people from either side killed, and that includes whether it's Russia, Ukraine, or whether it's the Palestinians and the Israelis and all of the, you know, the different entities that we have in the Middle East. There's so many different entities. But I don't want people killed.\n\nWhen you say productive things are happening, can you be more specific?\n\nNo, I can't. I mean, I'd love to be, I would so love to be, but I can't. I will be. We're going to sit down in a period of time, hopefully soon, and I'll tell you all the things that are happening. But there are some very productive things happening. I do think-okay, because I'm looking at two, two primary fronts, right? You have the Russia-Ukraine, and you have this, and there are other problems also. But look, when North Korea gets involved, that's another element that's a very complicating factor. And I know Kim Jong Un, I get along very well with Kim Jong Un. I'm probably the only one he's ever really dealt with. When you think about it, I am the only one he's ever dealt with. But you have a lot of very bad complicating factors there, but we'll sit down and we'll at the end of each of these, or both, maybe simultaneously, we'll sit down and I'll show you what a good job I did.\n\nYou mentioned the Palestinian people. In your first term, your administration put forward the most comprehensive plan for a two-state solution in a long time. Do you still support that plan?\n\nI support a plan of peace, and it can take different forms. When I did the Abraham Accords, that should have been loaded up with people, you know. I made a statement. I think they didn't add one country. Think of it. They didn't add one country to the Abraham Accords. We had the four countries, very important countries, but that should have been loaded up with Middle Eastern countries.\n\nDo you still support a two-state solution?\n\nI support whatever solution we can do to get peace. There are other ideas other than two state, but I support whatever, whatever is necessary to get not just peace, a lasting peace. It can't go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives.\n\nYour incoming ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, supports the settlement movement and Israel annexing the West Bank. The real question at the heart of this, sir, is, do you want to get a two-state deal done, outlined in your Peace to Prosperity deal that you put forward, or are you willing to let Israel annex the West Bank?\n\nSo what I want is a deal where there's going to be peace and where the killing stops.\n\nWould you tell Israel-Bibi tried last time and you stopped him. Would you do it again this time?\n\nWe'll see what happens. Yeah, I did. I stopped him. But we'll see what happens. October 7 was a very terrible day. You know, October 7. People are forgetting about it. They don't ever mention. It was a tragic day. The other thing that's happening are the hostages, where are the hostages, why aren't they back? Well, they could be gone. They could be gone. I think Hamas is probably saying, Wow, the hostages are gone. That's what they want.\n\nSo there's a scenario where you would allow Israel to annex the West Bank?\n\nI will-what I'm doing and what I'm saying again, I'll say it again, I want a long lasting peace. I'm not saying that's a very likely scenario, but I want a long lasting peace, a peace where we don't have an October 7 in another three years. And there are numerous ways you can do it. You can do it two state, but there are numerous ways it can be done. And I'd like to see, who can be happy? But I'd like to see everybody be happy. Everybody go about their lives, and people stop from dying. That includes on many different fronts. I mean, we have some tremendous world problems that we didn't have when I was president. You know, when I left, we had, we had an Iran that was not very threatening. They had no money. They weren't giving money to Hamas. They weren't giving money to Hezbollah.\n\nIran recently plotted to have you assassinated. What are the chances of going to war with Iran during your next term?\n\nAnything can happen. Anything can happen. It's a very volatile situation. I think the most dangerous thing right now is what's happening, where Zelensky has decided, with the approval of, I assume, the President, to start shooting missiles into Russia. I think that's a major escalation. I think it's a foolish decision. But I would imagine people are waiting until I get in before anything happens. I would imagine. I think that would be very smart to do that.\n\nDo you trust Netanyahu?\n\nI don't trust anybody.\n\nCan I ask, Did Elon Musk meet with the Iranians at your behest?\n\nI don't know that he met with them.\n\nReportedly he met with the Iranians.\n\nI don't know. He didn't tell me that.\n\nLet's shift back to some domestic issues. Will you vow that your FDA will not do anything to limit access to medication abortion or abortion pills?\n\nWell, we're going to take a look at all of that. That's why I'm here. We're going to take a look at all of that.\n\nSo it's possible they may?\n\nYou're talking about the abortion pill?\n\nI'm talking about the abortion pill. FDA approvals-\n\nIt's unlikely, very unlikely.\n\nBut possible? If they tried to, would you stop them?\n\nYou know my stance from a long campaign. A long and hard campaign. I was against that. I was against that. Strongly against.\n\nCan you be specific? Strongly against?\n\nStrongly against. You're talking about the abortion pill.\n\nYou're against the abortion pill?\n\nNo, I was against stopping it.\n\nRight. Okay, just to clarify.\n\nSo I don't see any reason why it changed, but somebody could come up with something that, you know, this horrible thing.\n\nYou won't rule it out, though?\n\nLook, I've stated it very clearly and I just stated it again very clearly. I think it would be highly unlikely. I can't imagine, but with, you know, we're looking at everything, but highly unlikely. I guess I could say probably as close to ruling it out as possible, but I don't want to. I don't want to do anything now. I want to do it at some point. There will be a time in the future where people are going to know everything about subjects like that, which are very complex subjects for people, because you have other people that, you know, they feel strongly both ways, really strongly both ways, and those are the things that are dividing up the country. But you know my stand from a very long, hard thing, and I think it's highly unlikely that I ever change that. Is it 100% unlikely that I change or that I stay-\n\nI think what the women of America want to know is, Are you committed to making sure that the FDA does not strip their ability to access abortion pills?\n\nThat would be my commitment. Yeah, it's always been my commitment.\n\nCan I shift to the transgender issue? Obviously, sort of a major issue during the campaign. In 2016, you said that transgender people could use whatever bathroom they chose. Do you still feel that way?\n\nWhen was that?\n\nIn 2016.\n\nI don't want to get into the bathroom issue. Because it's a very small number of people we're talking about, and it's ripped apart our country, so they'll have to settle whatever the law finally agrees. I am a big believer in the Supreme Court, and I'm going to go by their rulings, and so far, I think their rulings have been rulings that people are going along with, but we're talking about a very small number of people, and we're talking about it, and it gets massive coverage, and it's not a lot of people.\n\nBut on that note, there's a big fight on this in Congress now. The incoming trans member from Delaware, Sarah McBride, says we should all be focused on more important issues. Do you agree?\n\nI do agree with that. On that-absolutely. As I was saying, it's a small number of people.\n\nIt was a big issue, though, on the campaign. I mean, one of the ads that your campaign put the most money behind was the: Trump is for us and Harris is for they / them.\n\nWell, it's true, Trump is for us.\n\nRight. It obviously strikes a chord.\n\nI mean, Trump is definitely for us, okay? And us is the vast, vast majority of people in this country. And also, I want to have all people treated fairly. You know, forget about majority or not majority. I want people to be treated well and fairly.\n\nLast question on the trans issue. Will you reverse Biden's protections for trans kids under Title Nine?\n\nI'm going to look at it very closely. We're looking at it right now. We're gonna look at it. We're gonna look at everything. Look, the country is torn apart. We're gonna look at everything.\n\nDo you plan to fire your hand-picked FBI director, Christopher Wray?\n\nI'll be announcing something in the future. I'm looking at people, and we'll make a decision in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAre you considering Kash Patel as a replacement?\n\nYes, I am. One of the people, yeah.\n\n[Editor's note: On Nov. 30, Trump announced he intends to nominate Patel to be FBI director.]\n\nHave you decided yet whether you're going to pardon all of the January 6 defendants?\n\nYes.\n\nYou're going to do all of them?\n\nI'm going to do case-by-case, and if they were non-violent, I think they've been greatly punished. And the answer is I will be doing that, yeah, I'm going to look if there's some that really were out of control.\n\nSo you will not include those who committed violent acts?\n\nWell, we're going to look at each individual case, and we're going to do it very quickly, and it's going to start in the first hour that I get into office. And a vast majority of them should not be in jail. A vast majority should not be in jail, and they've suffered gravely. And I say, why is it that in Portland and in many other places, Minneapolis, why is it that nothing happened with them and they actually caused death and destruction at levels not seen before? So you know, if you take a look at what happened in Seattle, you had people die, you had a lot of death, and nothing happened, and these people have been treated really, really badly. Yeah, it's an important issue for me. They've suffered greatly, and in many cases they should not have suffered.\n\nWe're sitting here moments after Jack Smith dropped the case against you. Over the course of the campaign, you vowed to or suggested prosecuting a long list of political rivals, whether it's Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Jack Smith, Alvin Bragg, Adam Schiff, Mark Milley. Did you raise these prosecutions of these people with Pam Bondi?\n\nNo.\n\nYou haven't spoken to her about it?\n\nNo.\n\nHow do you expect her to proceed?\n\nI think she's going to be fair to everybody. She's very respected. She's a very, very smart and even brilliant person. She was a successful at the highest level Attorney General-\n\nAre there going to be investigations of these subjects, of these people?\n\nThat's up to her. That'll be up to her.\n\nSteven Cheung: We're coming up on 45 minutes.\n\nIs there anything positive we can talk about?\n\nActually we do, but it's a complicated world. Let's do some rapid fire questions-\n\nI did win the greatest election that a lot of people say we had in hundreds of years.\n\nWell, here's something we can talk about. The GOP will have full control of Congress. You're gonna have a governing trifecta after you won. What are your first priorities in Congress?\n\nWell, my first priorities are, I don't really need Congress for it, frankly, securing the border and drilling for oil.\n\nAre you going to push for any major legislation in your first year in office?\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nWhat will that be?\n\nWell, we have to extend the tax cuts, very importantly. I think it's a very important thing, but, and our Secretary of Treasury has been really well received, as you see by the stock market, et cetera, but very important, we have to extend the tax cuts. But you know, a lot of the things when, when the Democrats were saying, you know, they need Congress to secure the border. They don't need Congress. All you have to do is say, I want the border secured. I had the most secure border we've ever had , and I never had to go to Congress for it.\n\nDo you think Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito should resign in the next two years so you can appoint younger successors?\n\nI think they're incredible, actually. So that's up to them, but I think they're incredible. I think they've been great justices.\n\nEveryone across the political spectrum recognizes the nature of your comeback, the historical nature of comeback, your resilience. What do you understand about the American psyche that your opponents do not?\n\nSee, I don't view it as a comeback. And people have said it was the greatest comeback in political history, and beyond even political history plus. They said, add sports and add everything else. But I don't view it that way. I think I ran a great campaign. I think I was popular. I think I did a very good job the first term. We got hit by COVID at the end. But even with COVID, we did a very, very good job that people are starting to recognize. But you take a look at those first few years, we've never had an economy even even close to that. So I don't, I don't view it as a comeback. I know it's considered that. I should allow it to be that, and I will allow it to be that. But, you know, come back from what? I've always been here, you know.\n\nI think more the point that sort of the question was driving at is, you know, you've won twice now.\n\nRight.\n\nYou've realigned both political parties, you've changed America. There's got to be something that you understand about winning votes or the American people that your opponents maybe don't give you credit for. And I guess I'm curious what that is.\n\nIt's, you know, I think people want to lead a good life. I think they want to be able to buy groceries at a reasonable price and not have to turn off their heat in order to buy two apples. I think that, I think that people want security. I don't think people want to have our borders rushed by-it's really an invasion of our country by foreign countries, and not just South America. I mean, these are countries all over the world. It's really, I think our people want common sense applied to their life, and they don't want to see a girl be beat up in a boxing ring by a man, as happens. They don't want to see somebody in a weight lifting contest, a woman against a man. It makes no sense. They don't want to see, you know, men playing in women's sports. They don't. They don't want to see all of this transgender, which is, it's just taken over. And then you take a look, and not very many years after the person who went through this process is saying, Who did this to me? As you know, it's a very high percentage . I really think that the people of this country have tremendous hearts. They understand and they want common sense applied to their lives. Most of the things I talk about are common sense. They don't want to see their food prices go up by 57% in a short period of time. And I think that's why I won. I think-I think that's why I won. The Republican Party has become the party of common sense, and it's so many of the things I mentioned, and other things too. They don't want to have all electric cars. They might want an electric car. Electric cars are great, but they're not for everybody. They also want gasoline-powered cars or hybrids or anything else that happens to come out. They don't want to have a mandate on cars where they're forced to buy a car that they don't want. There are so many things. I mean, they're too innumerable. There's too many to mention. I could go on all day long giving you crazy, crazy stats-\n\nBut your appeal pre-exists a lot of this stuff-\n\nYeah, Eric, but in the end, they want to see our country run with common sense. They don't want to be invaded by 100 and 182 at this moment. We've had during the course of the last three years-182, people don't realize how many countries there are. There are a lot of countries, 182 is not even close to the number, okay, but we had 182 countries where people invaded our country, essentially invaded our country. We don't know who they are, we don't know where they are. We don't know anything about them. They just walk into our country and they take over. You see what's happening with the Venezuelan gangs. They're in all-they're in many different states. They're in like 12 states as of this moment, and they are causing tremendous havoc and violence. People don't want that.\n\nI know that obviously you're only about to enter office, but I'm sort of curious about kind of the legacy component. Lindsey Graham says Trump's policies don't work without Trump. You said that you believe in some ways that's true. If that's the case, how does MAGA endure as a political movement after you leave office in four years?\n\nWell, my policies-I heard that statement. I thought it was actually a very interesting statement. We can use the same words, but maybe it's a look in your eye that works. You know, for a country like Mexico, we're not going to allow Mexico to continue to invade our country by allowing people to be dropped off in Mexico and come into the United States. We're not going to allow that to happen. And I will say it to Mexico one way, and somebody will say the same thing to Mexico another way, and maybe my way is accepted, and somebody else, with the same words, it's not accepted. So I sort of agree with him, but there are others that maybe can do it, maybe they can't do it as well, but my policies work. I mean, my policies work. We have to be-what's happening with the people coming through Mexico and Canada also, you know, we can't forget Canada. We have tremendous illegal immigration coming in through Canada. Drugs are coming in through Canada in large numbers. We're not going to allow that to happen. And I'll take action against Canada and Mexico. We're not going to allow this to happen.\n\nYou have galvanized a social and political movement that has transformed this country. What do you think will happen to the MAGA movement when you leave office or when you are no longer on the scene?\n\nWell, I hope when I leave office, I'll be able to also leave people that are extremely competent and get it. And we do have those people. We have far more than you think. We have some great warriors. We have some great people that want to see this country take care of-\n\nDo those people include members of your family?\n\nSay it.\n\nDo those people include members of your family?\n\nI think, yeah, I have some very competent members of my family. My kids are very competent. I don't know that they're going to choose to go through this. They've been treated very badly. I mean, my son Don has spent hours and hours in front of, essentially, grand juries and Congress over something he never had anything to do with: Russia. He'd come back and say, \"Dad, I have nothing to do with Russia.\" He didn't know anything about Russia, and it would turn out to be a hoax.\n\nHe's very politically active.\n\nHe is.\n\nDo you think he might have a future in politics?\n\nI think he'd do well, especially in certain areas. I think he'd do very well. I think he's a very capable guy. Eric is very capable, and a very different type. Lara. You look at some of these people. Ivanka would be, if she wanted to be, would be a superstar in politics. I think she, she, she's a great person. I think she probably, she's so family-oriented, Ivanka, and I understand that also it makes it more difficult. It makes it definitely more difficult. But, you know, they're very capable people. Well, they have a name, which seems to be a very good name.\n\nDo you think there will be a Trump dynasty?\n\nI think there could be, yeah. I see the people we're talking about. Lara has been amazing. Look, she was the head of the Republican Party. She's a young, a young woman, and she was the head of the Republican Party. And look at the job we did. This cheating would have been breathtaking, breathtaking. And we, we, we got it down to a minimum. And they cheat, but we got it down to a minimum. They were very effective. The RNC was very, very effective.\n\nWhat would your father think of your political comeback?\n\nI think he maybe would not call it a comeback. He would have said it's just Donald.\n\nBut what would he think of your political career?\n\nOh, he would have been amazed, yeah. My father would have been amazed, because my father didn't make speeches. He didn't make, you know, it wasn't, he probably could have done it well, but it wouldn't have been his thing. I don't think it would have been his thing. It's sort of a combination of both the mother and the father. You needed a lot of energy to do that. You know, I did, I did rallies. We did, what, 12 rallies in three days, and these were full rallies. Because, you know, when people are waiting for two days and three days to get in, you can't do-people say, Well, maybe you keep it down to 25 minutes or 15 minutes. If I ever went up for 15 minutes, they're waiting for days. You know, they have tents. We had many people that followed the rallies. They followed it and it'll never happen again. It's sad in a way. It will never happen again.\n\nYou get some things from your father. What do you get from your mother?\n\nSo my mother was a woman. She was born in Scotland. She had great respect for the queen, Queen Elizabeth. It was a long time. She was there for 75 years. And she liked the pomp and ceremony. She thought it was a good thing, not a bad thing. But she was glamorous and my father was hard nosed. It's sort of an interesting combination. Maybe there's a combination. Here we sit in Mar a Lago. Maybe there's a combination of that.\n\nWill the First Lady be joining you at the White House for this term?\n\nOh yes. She was, she was very, she actually became very active towards the end, as you saw with interviews. And she does-she does them well. People really watch. She's very beloved by the people, Melania. And they like the fact that she's not out there in your face all the time for many reasons. Many political people have that, you know. But she's, she's really, they really like her. They really love her. Actually, in many ways, when I make speeches, we love our First Lady.  they have signs, we love our First Lady. No, she'll be-she'll be active, when she needs to be, when she needs to be.\n\nI've been keeping a list, Mr. President, of things you mentioned that you intend to do early in your administration. It sounds like a reasonable number of things: turning the Department of Education virtual.\n\nWell, virtual, turning it back to the states.\n\nJ6 pardons. Do you have in mind what the first 24 to 48 hours will look like?\n\nI'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes. I'll be looking at oil prices bringing down, you know, coming down very substantially-meaning energy, energy costs coming down. And with energy comes everything else. See, they really hurt themselves. It went away from my energy policies, totally. It was going to crash. The numbers were through the roof. And then they went back to them. They said, Okay, just let it be. That was the difference between the energy, what they did on energy, and what they did at the border. At the border, they just opened it up to the world. They didn't stop it. You know, we had Remain in Mexico. We had-that border was in was in great shape. Not easy to do. But on that one, they just said, open it up. And they didn't change. They just did that. With energy, they opened, you saw what was going on. The energy was going through the roof. And then they said, just go back to Trump's policy. And they went back. Now the difference is that I would have had three times as much now. They have essentially, sort of, they tried to get to equal but if they didn't do that, you'd have energy, you'd have you'd have inflation that would have been much worse than it is. And it already was probably the worst this country has ever had. We've had the inflation. They lost on inflation, they lost on immigration, they lost on-as a part of immigration, I think a very big part is the border, the border itself. You know, if you can self subdivide the word immigration. They lost on the economy. But it was a different kind of-it was the economy as it pertains to groceries and small things that are actually big things for a family.\n\nIf the prices of groceries don't come down, will your presidency be a failure?\n\nI don't think so. Look, they got them up. I'd like to bring them down. It's hard to bring things down once they're up. You know, it's very hard. But I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down. I think a better supply chain is going to bring them down. You know, the supply chain is still broken. It's broken. You see it. You go out to the docks and you see all these containers. And I own property in California, in Palos Verdes. They're very nice. And I passed the docks, and I've been doing it for 20 years. I've never seen anything like it. You know, for 17 years, I saw containers and, you know, they'd come off and they'd be taken away-big areas, you know, you know, in that area, you know, where they have the big, the big ships coming in-big, the port. And I'd see this for years as I was out there inspecting property and things, because they own a lot in California. And I look down and I see containers that are, that are 12, 13, 14 containers. You wouldn't believe they can hold each other. It's like crazy. No, the supply chain is is broken. I think a very bad thing is this, what they're doing with the cars. I think they lost also because of cars. You know, there are a lot of reasons, but the car mandate is a disaster. The electric, the EV mandate.\n\nAnd does Elon agree with that?\n\nOh, it's very interesting. I tell people that Elon is a friend of mine. He's a great guy. Gave me the best endorsement you could ever have. And here I am talking against the electric car. Think of that. But see, I'm not really talking against the electric car, because the electric car, I think, is fantastic for some people, for a slice of the audience, but not for 100% and, you know that Elon, a big part of his business is the Tesla, which is a great car, but Elon has never once, it's actually hard to believe. He's never once even talked about the subject. He'll hear me speaking, you know, speaking, \"We must stop. I will immediately terminate the mandate.\" Because I think he thinks I'm right. I'm a big fan of the electric car, but not for everyone.\n\nSome people say his competitors benefit from the mandate. He's got the head start.\n\nHe makes a great product.\n\nBut I do think it's interesting, because when he talks about how he came to be such a full-throated supporter of yours, it's cultural issues that are core to that. And I think that when you kind of give your taxonomy of the reasons why you won that-I mean, you did, you mentioned the trans issues, but I feel like it's one that also was, was integral in a lot of ways, it seemed.\n\nSo he was not, he wasn't a-\n\nNo, he described himself like, basically, a moderate Democrat, a centrist, more or less.\n\nHe was a Democrat. And I think over time-you know, something happened when I got shot. I got called by people that weren't fans, and they became fans. And I don't view it as bravery. I view it as whatever it was that it was, you know, but, but something happened, and I think that sped up. I think Elon was getting there, but I think it sped up the process a lot with him and many other people. Mark Zuckerberg-\n\nBudowich: It's now five a clock. We've got about 12 meetings left.\n\nI'm curious. You have control of Congress, both houses. Much of your agenda is executive driven. Why?\n\nUm...\n\nYou have the power to do things legislatively.\n\nYeah?\n\nSo why is so much of your agenda executive driven?\n\nI don't know what you mean by that.\n\nWell, you said lots of what you can do is without-\n\nOh, like executive orders.\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, I think that Congress should have behaved differently when it came to the border. I ended up taking the money. You know, I built, you know, hundreds of miles of wall, but I took it from the military because I considered it an invasion. I got-look, I passed the biggest tax cuts ever, bigger than the Reagan tax cuts. I passed a lot of things in Congress, but I also did a lot of executive orders. I think that this Congress is going to be a better Congress for me. I didn't get along with Paul Ryan. I didn't like him. I didn't respect him. I didn't get along with Mitch McConnell, and I thought it was-I thought some of the things that he did were terrible. The way he was handing out money for the Green New Deal was just terrible. I do get along with, I mean, it's a new relationship, essentially, because we didn't really know each other very well. But I do get along with Sen. Thune. I do get along with Mike Johnson. I think, you know, Mike is doing a really good job. Both of them are doing a good job. If I have, if I have even a little bit of trouble, I go to an executive order because I can get it done. And some of the things I did as an executive order, I had them approved then later on through Congress. In other words, I'd get it done now and get it-look, the great thing about an executive order is you can do it, get it done immediately. The bad thing, or the good thing, depending on where you're coming from, is you can undo it. Look, I can undo almost everything Biden did, he through executive order. And on day one, much of that will be undone.\n\nDo you support ending the filibuster?\n\nI want to leave the Supreme Court the way it is, most importantly. The filibuster is a mechanism that you're not going to totally overturn every single thing that was ever done. You know, it makes it very difficult in the Senate. It makes it very, very difficult to overturn things. Now, in one way, that's good. In another way, maybe you'd say it's bad. But you know, some of the things-I have great respect for Manchin and for Sinema, for the fact that they really held out. Look, she lost her career because of it. And you could say he maybe lost his career because of it. Actually, he became hotter because of it. And then he made the mistake of going for the Inflation Creation Act-which is my nickname, by the way, for the Inflation Reduction Act. Had he not gone for that because he was very popular. But no, I-and I think we have to do, we have. Our Supreme Court was under siege, and perhaps it still is, but now they don't have, now the other side doesn't have the power to do. I mean, I've heard as many as 25 justices, and they were all psyched. They were going to do a number on our Supreme Court that now it's not going to happen.\n\nCheung: Let me just interject here. But we've got to make this the last question.\n\nSo I have respect for the filibuster.\n\nYou'd want to keep it in place?\n\nYes.\n\nI want to go back to that moment you talked about, Mr. President, how people changed when you were shot. I'm curious how you changed.\n\nI try not to think about it. That was a big moment. It was a big moment. I had a big crowd. We had 55,000 people RSVPed. We had 107,000 when we had the memorial a few weeks later, but we had a few months later actually. When you think, late October, yeah. We had, I think it was a very big moment. I think a lot of people changed with that moment. I think a lot of people became much more religious in that moment.\n\nIs that true of you?\n\nI think I have family members that became more of a believer than they would have been. A lot of people, a lot of people change. That was-that was a horrible day, it was a horrible moment in our country, but I think it, it did change a lot of a lot of minds.\n\nThank you so much, Mr. President.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "How do Americans feel about President Trump? What approval ratings show after 2 busy months\n\n(Story has been updated to add more information.)\n\nThursday marked two months since President Donald Trump was sworn into office for his second term.\n\nWhile Trump's net approval ratings came out of the gates higher than in 2017, though still lower than those of any other president in modern history, recent polls show public sentiment more split, or in some cases more negative.\n\nBy late February, just one month into his term, his net approval rating - which is calculated as the difference between a president's approval and disapproval polling averages - had shrunk to nearly even.\n\nSince then, Trump has marched on with federal agency cuts and has continued to feature Elon Musk in a central role in his administration, both of which are controversial with voters, multiple polls have shown.\n\nMany modern presidents have seen their approval ratings gradually dip throughout their first year in office as they exit the so-called \"honeymoon period.\"\n\nHere is what polls tell us about how Americans approve of Trump's second presidency so far.\n\nTwo months later, Trump's approval ratings did not show a major shift from the beginning of his term or compared with his first term, according to Costas Panagopoulos, head of political science at Northeastern University.\n\nBut he also said voters may continue to have reservations about the administration's priorities as the early policies unfold, especially as inflation continues and the stock market tries to recover from a tumble that started in February.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who dismissed other claims and comments that he made during the campaign because they expected that his priorities would be in line with things that they wanted,\" he told USA TODAY in an interview Thursday, mentioning the economy and inflation as examples. \"Now they're seeing well that might not be the case.\"\n\nBut crucial to understanding Trump's approval ratings, Panagopoulos says, is the Republican and Democratic parties, because Trump's approval ratings come from an already polarized electorate.\n\nWhile Democrats are fragmented, Republicans are putting forward a \"united front\" in supporting Trump, according to Panagopoulos.\n\n\"At least for now, that might be artificially inflating Trump's approval numbers overall, but specifically among Republicans,\" he said. \"People are not going to move away from Trump until they have an alternative they can move towards.\"\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nNBC News:\n\nEconomist/YouGov :\n\nMorning Consult :\n\nRMG Research/Napolitan News Service :\n\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Trump admin no longer requires ban on segregated facilities in government contracts\n\nThe Trump administration is no longer requiring an explicit prohibition of segregated facilities in new government contracts.\n\nThe Feb. 15 memo from the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) was first reported by NPR Tuesday.\n\nSegregation is still illegal in the U.S. and the memo states contractors are still subject to laws on civil rights and nondiscrimination.\n\nBut the directive from the GSA, which manages federal property and sources contracting options for other agencies, came in response to one of President Donald Trump 's executive orders aimed at rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion in the federal government. Here is what to know about the order:\n\nThe memo states that the changes to contract and solicitation terms for federal agencies are necessary after Trump's Jan. 21 executive order titled \"Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.\"\n\nAlong with other programs Trump considered under the diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility umbrella, the order revoked the 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity executive order signed by former President Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson's order required government contracts to include nondiscrimination language.\n\nIn its place, as the memo lays out, contracts \"do not include\" provisions including 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities , which includes restrooms, drinking fountains and transportation.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump posted on X about the measure, saying, \"this change sends a CLEAR message.\"\n\nMuslim civil rights and advocacy organization Council on American-Islamic Relations also criticized the measure.\n\n\"As our nation unfortunately becomes more divided and polarized, the last thing we need is any effort that could be perceived as allowing racial segregation,\" said CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper in an emailed statement. \"We must not turn back the clock to a time in our nation's history when racism and white supremacy were written into laws and contracts.\"\n\nBut GSA spokesperson Stephanie Joseph defended the measure saying that duplicative regulations in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the regulation standard for government suppliers, put an \"unnecessary burden\" on American companies working with the government.\n\n\"This is why reforming the (Federal Acquisition Regulation) is such a high priority for GSA and this administration,\" Joseph said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"We are moving at the speed of need to quickly undo the damaging policies of the past administration.

      "text": "Donald Trump approval rating today: Here's what polls say after two months on the job\n\nPresidential approval ratings provide a glimpse of how Americans really feel on any given day , often times driven by his handling of the issues at hand . Here's how Trump is polling after his first two months in office.\n\nDespite the chaotic start to his second term, mired with the high price of eggs , mass firings of government workers, the onslaught of tariffs and trade wars , and the Zelensky meeting fiasco , and mounting fears of a recession, Trump's presidential approval rating have overall remained steady and in some cases - his highest rating yet.\n\nAccording to this week's most current polls, Fox News reported that 49% approve of Trump's job performance compared to 51% that do not. Among Democrats polled, a whopping 92% disapproved compared to 8% that did approve. The exact opposite showed from Republicans with a 92% favorability.\n\nIt may be most noteworthy that among independents in this poll , 38% approve of Trump's presidential job performance compared to 61% that do not.\n\nThe poll also found that 68% of Americans are concerned about Trump's use of executive orders - over 90 in the first two months - compared to 31% that were not.\n\nAnother faction of the poll showed Vice President JD Vance's approval ratings at 45% compared to 53% that disapproved. DOGE architect Elon Musk had a 40% approval rating compared to 58% that disapproved and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was even with a 47% rate of approval and 47% rate of disapproval.\n\nHere's what the most current polls show about Trump's presidential ratings right now.\n\nThe national NBC News poll shows Trump's approval rating at 47% with more registered voters seeing the US as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004. Albeit, the majority of Americans still say the country is on the wrong track and he holds a higher rate of 51% that disapprove of his performance as president right now, according to the report.\n\nThe poll shows that despite the slightly higher disapproval numbers over Trump's overall presidential job performance, the margin is closer than at any other point during his first term. Other noteworthy results of the poll include an increased number of Republicans identifying with MAGA, more Americans \"have come around\" on his deportation-focused immigration policies and they like the general concept behind the Department of Government Efficiency and Trump's efforts to cut government jobs and spending.\n\nOne poll result in particular showed that voters are quite evenly split on the future 2026 midterm elections as a divided Democratic party, facing record-low popularity , is trying to figure how to respond to Trump. That record low shows just 27% of registered voters viewing the Democratic party positively, among a total that included 59% of self identified Democrats.\n\nThe most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll , shows that despite a steady 44% approval rating since taking office, other areas of his job performance have changed. Americans' view on his handling of the economy, for example, have gone from 43% in late January to 39% this week.\n\nWhen questioned whether Trump's moves to shake up the economy were too erratic, the polls show 57% concurred. When questioned on tariffs, 32% thought they were a good idea versus 53% who thought they were bad. And 53% of those polled felt that tariffs will do more harm than good, while 31% didn't.\n\nIn a SSRS/CNN poll , 45% approve of his job as president versus 54% who disapprove. There was some notable difference in approval on more specific topics, such as 51% approved of his immigration handling, 48% approved of his handling of the federal budget and 45% approved of how he was handling the economy.\n\nTrump's struggle in the poll showed up in his handling of tariffs with a 39% approval versus 61% that disapproved.\n\nRealClear Polling which encompasses 13 different pollsters, including those mentioned above, shows Trump favorability at 47.9% versus 48.8% that disapprove, as of today.\n\nNote: Polls are constantly changing and different pollsters ask different varieties of the population. These numbers were reflected as of Monday, March 21, 2025 at 9 a.m."

      "text": "Trump orders shift on student loan management to Small Business Administration\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday he has decided that the Small Business Administration will handle student loans, taking it out of the Education Department immediately.\n\n\"They are all set for it, they are waiting for it. It'll be serviced much better than it has in the past,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump ordered his administration to dismantle the Department of Education , looking to achieve a top campaign promise even though the White House acknowledged the agency can't ‒ and won't - entirely be dissolved without an act of Congress .\n\nTrump also announced that Health and Human Services will take over \"handling special needs and all of the nutrition programs and everything else.\"\n\nIn 2024, student loan debt in the United States totaled $1.777 trillion and was held by 42.7 million borrowers, according to the Education Data Initiative.\n\nTrump's executive order instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities.\" The department has already laid off about half of it's staff .\n\nIt is unclear when and how the relatively small agency will take over managing the country's massive student loan portfolio, and how much disruption borrowers might experience while the transition takes place. Colleges and universities are already reporting a backlog after hundreds of employees in the department's Federal Student Aid office were laid off .\n\nHigh school students across the country are still finding out which colleges they've been accepted to and in the process of applying for federal student aid.\n\nThe SBA was established in 1953 to administer small business and disaster recovery loans. It played a crucial role during the pandemic, helping distribute small business aid.\n\nShortly before Trump's announcement, the Small Business Administration announced in a news release it will cut its workforce by 43%, eliminating approximately 2,700 positions out of a total active workforce of nearly 6,500.\n\nThe Education Department's Federal Student Aid office had about 1,500 employees to handle questions, applications and problems.\n\nThe Small Business Administration was criticized for large amounts of fraud and misuse of COVID-related relief loans during the pandemic. The agency's Inspector General estimated in 2023 that the agency disbursed over $200 billion in potentially fraudulent loans equaling 17% of all loans distributed.\n\nTrump told reporters in the White House on March 6 that he was weighing bringing student loans under the jurisdiction of the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or the Small Business Administration."

      "text": "Donald Trump's approval ratings: Here's what polls say now about the president\n\nDonald Trump's presidential approval ratings held steady during his first month in office, despite the chaotic start that included mass firings of government workers, soaring egg prices, a volatile stock market and the growing tariff wars being waged on countries around the world.\n\nTrump imposed a sweeping 25% tariff on steel and aluminum on Wednesday in what he claims are efforts to correct or level the field of trade imbalances and re-igniting domestic industry; Canada and Europe quickly retaliated with billions in retaliatory tariffs .\n\nIn his recent address to Congress, Trump admitted his presidency was off to a \"swift and unrelenting\" start. He discussed and defended many of his administration's controversial actions such as drastic government cuts and mass layoffs, eradicating wokeness and diversity initiatives in the workforce and schools, the 25% tariffs he imposed on neighboring trade partners, Canada and Mexico, and his continued crackdown on immigration and border control.\n\nAccording to the most recent Gallup poll , Trump's job approval rating was averaging 46% since he took office in this second term. His first term overall average was a 41% approval rating. At any given time during both terms thus far, his lowest to highest approval ratings have ranged between 34%-49%.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll reported that 44% of those surveyed gave him a favorable approval rating of his first month performance in office. There's also reporting that public approval of his current job so far has remained higher than his first term in office and higher than former President Joe Biden overall.\n\nThe Reuters poll broke down a 47% favorability rating on his approach over immigration, compared to 42% who did not support his immigration policy.\n\nThe ABC News project538 poll showed a 47.7% favorability of Trump's presidential performance as of Friday morning, and the same polls showed 54.4% of Americans disapprove of Congress. It shows Vice President JD Vance had a slightly higher disapproval rating of 42.8%, compared to 40.8% that viewed him favorably.\n\nTrump's approval ratings were bound to be swayed by newly imposed tariffs and the volatile losses in the stock market. Here's how Americans feel about Trump, according to the most recent polls.\n\nIn a SSRS/CNN poll released Wednesday, 45% approve of his job as president versus 54% who disapprove. There was some notable difference in approval on more specific topics, such as 51% approved of his immigration handling, 48% approved of his handling of the federal budget and 45% approved of how he was handling the economy.\n\nTrump's struggle in the poll showed up in his handling of tariffs with a 39% approval versus 61% that disapproved.\n\nAn Emerson College Polling survey , released after Trump's 50-day mark in office, found 47% of voters approved of his job performance and 45% disapproved. This was a drop from the 49% approval and 41% disapproval rating at the beginning of his second term.\n\nNote: Polls are constantly changing and different pollsters ask different varieties of the population.

      "text": "Trump administration to give countries new tariff 'number' on April 2: Updates\n\nThe Trump administration will give countries a proposed tariff rate based on their own rates, non-tariff trade barriers and other factors while also providing an opportunity to negotiate around the \"tariff wall,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.\n\n\"On April 2, each country will receive a number that we believe represents their tariffs,\" Bessent told Fox Business Network . \"For some countries, it could be quite low. For some countries, it could be quite high.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said the \"reciprocal tariffs\" taking effect April 2 will offset trade practices his administration deems unfair. Bessent said the tariffs are designed to protect the U.S. economy, its workers and industries.\n\n\"We are going to go to them and say, 'Look, here's where we think the tariff levels are, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, unfair funding, labor suppression, and if you will stop this, we will not put up the tariff wall,'\" Bessent said of trading partners.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ In an extremely rare public rebuke , Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement  \"impeachment is not an appropriate response'' after Trump called for such an action against a federal judge who ruled against the administration's efforts to immediately deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.\n\n∎ In another court setback for the Trump administration, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., temporarily prevented enforcement of the president's executive order barring transgender people from the military while the measure is challenged by 20 current and prospective service members.\n\n∎ Trump fired the two Democratic commissioners at the Federal Trade Commission, Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, another move that tests the independence of regulatory agencies and may be challenged in court much like similar recent executive actions. Bedoya and Slaughter said the firings are illegal.\n\n∎ Trump signed a memorandum Tuesday to prevent any government hiring for foreign policy positions based on diversity, equity and inclusion, according to the White House.\n\n∎ The reduction in funding for global health projects from countries like the U.S., which has paused foreign aid under Trump, may jeopardize vaccination programs against deadly diseases such as measles and AIDS, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the WHO on his first day back in office.\n\nA federal judge in Maryland said Tuesday that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency likely acted unconstitutionally \"in multiple ways'' when it abruptly shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development, and he barred the cost-cutters from firing any more USAID employees or terminating USAID contracts.\n\nJudge Theodore D. Chuang wrote that the accelerated layoffs and contract terminations \"deprived the public's elected representatives in Congress of their constitutional authority to decide whether, when, and how to close down an agency created by Congress.\"\n\nMore than two dozen former employees or contractors of USAID filed a civil lawsuit against Musk and DOGE challenging their terminations. Chuang ordered Musk and DOGE to reinstate access to email and payment systems for all current USAID employees as he continues to consider the case before issuing a final ruling.\n\n- Aysha Bagchi\n\nAn independent nonprofit that's funded by Congress to promote conflict prevention and resolution internationally is now in the middle of a struggle with Trump and Musk's DOGE.\n\nDOGE staffers with support from the Washington Metropolitan Police Department made their way into the U.S. Institute of Peace building Monday in a dramatic confrontation after being denied entry Friday and told the agency is not part of the executive branch.\n\nTrump has sought to dismantle the institute, which was founded by Congress in 1984 with the purpose of \"protecting U.S. interests by helping to prevent violent conflicts and broker peace deals abroad,'' its website says.\n\nWhen the DOGE personnel returned Monday with law enforcement agents and evicted USIP officials, its employees called police and reported a break-in. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said USIP had not complied with Trump's reduction order from February.\n\nMost of the USIP board and CEO George Moose were fired by the Trump administration, a termination Moose is contesting. He told reporters his organization has been speaking with administration officials for weeks and making clear the agency is not under their jurisdiction.\n\n\"We are a private, nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia and therefore not a federal agency, and therefore the federal government has no entitlement to come in and take over our building,'' Moose said.\n\nTrump administration officials recently considered but rejected a plan to simplify the protocols for setting new tariff rates for hundreds of nations by sorting them into three tariff tiers, the Wall Street Journal reported .\n\nThe Journal, citing people close to policy discussions, said duty levels with low, medium and high rates were discussed Thursday at a meeting that included Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\nHowever, the protocols remain fluid as Trump's team tries to sort how to individualize a rate for each nation, the Journal reported, adding that developing reciprocal tariffs unique to each country could take six months or more.\n\nThe federal government has begun the process of reinstating more than 24,000 probationary employees who were fired before a federal judge ruled the sweeping effort to shrink the government was illegal.\n\nDistrict Judge James K. Bredar granted a temporary restraining order last week demanding the Trump administration reinstate federal probationary employees terminated on or after Jan. 20. Bredar said officials failed to follow proper rules for the layoffs and weren't truthful in claiming workers were fired for \"performance\" reasons . The case was filed by attorneys general in 19 states and the District of Columbia, all Democrats.\n\nA filing late Monday in a federal court in Maryland said the reinstatement process was underway for the workers despite the \"substantial burdens\" the process creates for the agencies and employees. The filing said all the employees brought back would be required to go through the lengthy onboarding process. Many of the reinstated workers have been placed on paid administrative leave.\n\nThe Treasury Department leads all departments with 7,613 probationary workers being brought back; the Internal Revenue Service accounts for 7,315 of them. It is followed by the Department of Agriculture, which is reinstating 5,714 previously fired workers, and the Department of Health and Human Services, which is bringing back 3,248 employees\n\nDespite the setback, Trump and the Musk-led DOGE are continuing their efforts to trim the federal payroll - which now numbers more than 2 million employees - by eliminating the Education Department and gutting many federal agencies.\n\nTrump pledged to encourage production of electricity at U.S. coal plants as he continued his push for cheap energy to combat inflation while dismissing environmental concerns.\n\n\"After years of being held captive by Environmental Extremists, Lunatics, Radicals, and Thugs, allowing other Countries, in particular China, to gain tremendous Economic advantage over us by opening up hundreds of all Coal Fire Power Plants, I am authorizing my Administration to immediately begin producing Energy with BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL,\" Trump said in a social media post late Monday.\n\nTrump said during a recent speech he would consider a plan to pay out $5,000 stimulus checks to taxpayers in the form of a \"DOGE dividend, which would come from 20% of the savings identified by DOGE . The idea was floated by Azoria investment firm CEO James Fishback on Musk's social media platform X, to which Musk replied, \" Will check with the President. \"\n\nIn a recent interview with NewsNation , Fishback said it was not enough to identify waste and fraud, saying the government should \"refund the taxpayer their hard-earned money when their money was wasted and misused.\" He wants checks sent only to households that are net-income taxpayers - people who pay more in taxes than they get back. Read more here .\n\n- Maria Francis\n\nTrump also said this week that the U.S. isn't anticipating any exemptions on major tariffs set to go into effect next month despite fears the tariffs could drive up prices, fuel a recession and push stock prices lower. Trump said recently that 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imported into the U.S. that went into effect last week are here to stay, adding that additional tariffs will kick in on April 2.\n\nWhile stocks have been volatile in the last few weeks, they rallied for a second straight session Monday, shrugging off concerns of a recession even though Bessent wouldn't rule one out . Bessent's comments came after Trump himself declined to weigh in on the possibility of a recession this year, telling Fox's Maria Bartiromo earlier this month: \"I hate to predict things like that.\"\n\nA tariff is a form of tax imposed on imports from another country. Economists generally agree that trade barriers raise consumer prices and negatively impact economic output and income, according to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax policy nonprofit.\n\nTariffs create more demand for domestic manufacturers, but those companies are also part of the global supply chain and therefore also are affected by tariffs .\n\nTrump has said his motivation for implementing tariffs is to get help from China, Canada and Mexico to curb the flow of migrants and illegal drugs into the U.S. The president has insisted the countries have not done enough to help address what he sees as core issues for his administration.\n\n- Kinsey Crowley and Jonathan Limehouse\n\nTrump won't say whether he thinks his sweeping tariff plan could help push the country into a recession . But the threat of tariffs and the already-increasing costs of everyday items are raising concerns about where the economy is headed.\n\nA recession could happen if more people are out of work , large companies see lower profits , the stock market slips and home prices tumble , according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nGenerally, a recession is marked by an extended period of many months or more of economic downturn. And even when a recession is acknowledged by experts and officials, not everyone agrees on when it started or when it ends.\n\n- Damon C.

A quick bio\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is known for his real estate empire in New York City, his lavish Mar-a-Lago estate in southern Florida, and his globally recognized branded properties - but where was he born and raised?\n\nTrump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York, to real estate developer Fredrick Trump, Sr., and Scottish immigrant Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. They raised their five children, Maryanne, Elizabeth, Fred Jr., Donald, and Robert , in a five-bedroom, Tudor-style home in the Jamaica Estates section of Queens, a borough of New York City.\n\nThe second youngest son had a history of trouble at school and was sent by his father to the New York Military Academy in Cornwall, New York, about 60 miles north of NYC, at the age of 13, according to the Washington Post. After graduation, he attended Fordham University in the Bronx for two years and then transferred to the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1968.\n\nTrump entered the business world in 1971, taking over his father's real estate company and renaming it the Trump Organization to focus on skyscrapers, hotels, casinos and golf courses. His book Art of the Deal was published in 1987, and his rise to national prominence was partly due to his role on the reality television show The Celebrity Apprentice , which ran from 2004 to 2015.\n\nThe businessman-turned-politician moved into the White House after winning the 2016 presidential election but still considered NYC home.\n\nAfter living for decades in Trump Towers in midtown Manhattan, the native New Yorker filed a \"declaration of domicile\" on Oct. 4, 2019, moving from the Empire State to the Sunshine State and listing the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, as his primary residence.\n\n\"Despite the fact that I pay millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year, I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state,\" Trump posted on social media on Oct. 31, 2019. \"In the end, it will be best for all concerned.\"\n\nSoon after, then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo , another politician from Queens, issued a farewell note of sorts on Twitter: \"It's not like @realDonaldTrump paid taxes here anyway; he's all yours, Florida.\"\n\nCy Neff reports on Wyoming politics for USA TODAY.

      "text": "USA TODAY's Editorial Board: Trump is 'unfit for the presidency'\n\nIn the 34-year history of USA TODAY, the Editorial Board has never taken sides in the presidential race. Instead, we've expressed opinions about the major issues and haven't presumed to tell our readers, who have a variety of priorities and values, which choice is best for them. Because every presidential race is different, we revisit our no-endorsement policy every four years. We've never seen reason to alter our approach. Until now.\n\nThis year, the choice isn't between two capable major party nominees who happen to have significant ideological differences. This year, one of the candidates - Republican nominee Donald Trump - is, by unanimous consensus of the Editorial Board , unfit for the presidency.\n\nFrom the day he declared his candidacy 15 months ago through this week's first presidential debate, Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the temperament, knowledge, steadiness and honesty that America needs from its presidents.\n\nWhether through indifference or ignorance, Trump has betrayed fundamental commitments made by all presidents since the end of World War II. These commitments include unwavering support for NATO allies, steadfast opposition to Russian aggression, and the absolute certainty that the United States will make good on its debts. He has expressed troubling admiration for authoritarian leaders and scant regard for constitutional protections.\n\nMike Pence: Donald Trump is ready to lead\n\nWhy we're breaking tradition: Our view\n\nWe've been highly critical of the GOP nominee in a number of previous editorials. With early voting already underway in several states and polls showing a close race, now is the time to spell out, in one place, the reasons Trump should not be president:\n\nHe is erratic. Trump has been on so many sides of so many issues that attempting to assess his policy positions is like shooting at a moving target. A list prepared by NBC details 124 shifts by Trump on 20 major issues since shortly before he entered the race. He simply spouts slogans and outcomes (he'd replace Obamacare with \"something terrific\") without any credible explanations of how he'd achieve them.\n\nHe is ill-equipped to be commander in chief. Trump's foreign policy pronouncements typically range from uninformed to incoherent. It's not just Democrats who say this. Scores of Republican national security leaders have signed an extraordinary open letter calling Trump's foreign policy vision \"wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle.\" In a Wall Street Journal column this month, Robert Gates, the highly respected former Defense secretary who served presidents of both parties over a half-century, described Trump as \"beyond repair.\"\n\nHe traffics in prejudice. From the very beginning, Trump has built his campaign on appeals to bigotry and xenophobia, whipping up resentment against Mexicans, Muslims and migrants. His proposals for mass deportations and religious tests are unworkable and contrary to America's ideals.\n\nTrump has stirred racist sentiments in ways that can't be erased by his belated and clumsy outreach to African Americans. His attacks on an Indiana-born federal judge of Mexican heritage fit \"the textbook definition of a racist comment,\" according to House Speaker Paul Ryan, the highest-ranking elected official in the Republican Party. And for five years, Trump fanned the absurd \"birther\" movement that falsely questioned the legitimacy of the nation's first black president.\n\nHis business career is checkered. Trump has built his candidacy on his achievements as a real estate developer and entrepreneur. It's a shaky scaffold, starting with a 1973 Justice Department suit against Trump and his father for systematically discriminating against blacks in housing rentals. (The Trumps fought the suit but later settled on terms that were viewed as a government victory.) Trump's companies have had some spectacular financial successes, but this track record is marred by six bankruptcy filings, apparent misuse of the family's charitable foundation, and allegations by Trump University customers of fraud. A series of investigative articles published by the USA TODAY Network found that Trump has been involved in thousands of lawsuits over the past three decades, including at least 60 that involved small businesses and contract employees who said they were stiffed. So much for being a champion of the little guy.\n\nHe isn't leveling with the American people. Is Trump as rich as he says? No one knows, in part because, alone among major party presidential candidates for the past four decades, he refuses to release his tax returns. Nor do we know whether he has paid his fair share of taxes, or the extent of his foreign financial entanglements.\n\nHe speaks recklessly. In the days after the Republican convention, Trump invited Russian hackers to interfere with an American election by releasing Hillary Clinton's emails, and he raised the prospect of \"Second Amendment people\" preventing the Democratic nominee from appointing liberal justices. It's hard to imagine two more irresponsible statements from one presidential candidate.\n\nHe has coarsened the national dialogue. Did you ever imagine that a presidential candidate would discuss the size of his genitalia during a nationally televised Republican debate? Neither did we. Did you ever imagine a presidential candidate, one who avoided service in the military, would criticize Gold Star parents who lost a son in Iraq? Neither did we. Did you ever imagine you'd see a presidential candidate mock a disabled reporter? Neither did we. Trump's inability or unwillingness to ignore criticism raises the specter of a president who, like Richard Nixon, would create enemies' lists and be consumed with getting even with his critics.\n\nHe's a serial liar. Although polls show that Clinton is considered less honest and trustworthy than Trump, it's not even a close contest. Trump is in a league of his own when it comes to the quality and quantity of his misstatements. When confronted with a falsehood, such as his assertion that he was always against the Iraq War, Trump's reaction is to use the Big Lie technique of repeating it so often that people begin to believe it.\n\nWe are not unmindful of the issues that Trump's campaign has exploited: the disappearance of working-class jobs; excessive political correctness; the direction of the Supreme Court; urban unrest and street violence; the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group; gridlock in Washington and the influence of moneyed interests. All are legitimate sources of concern.\n\nNor does this editorial represent unqualified support for Hillary Clinton , who has her own flaws (though hers are far less likely to threaten national security or lead to a constitutional crisis). The Editorial Board does not have a consensus for a Clinton endorsement.\n\nSome of us look at her command of the issues, resilience and long record of public service - as first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of State - and believe she'd serve the nation ably as its president.\n\nOther board members have serious reservations about Clinton's sense of entitlement, her lack of candor and her extreme carelessness in handling classified information.\n\nWhere does that leave us? Our bottom-line advice for voters is this: Stay true to your convictions. That might mean a vote for Clinton, the most plausible alternative to keep Trump out of the White House. Or it might mean a third-party candidate. Or a write-in. Or a focus on down-ballot candidates who will serve the nation honestly, try to heal its divisions, and work to solve its problems.\n\nWhatever you do, however, resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue. By all means vote, just not for Donald Trump.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board , separate from the news staff.

      "text": "Donald Trump to address Congress amid growing pessimism about the economy\n\nWASHINGTON ― Anxiety about the state of the economy and inflation under former President Joe Biden helped catapult President Donald Trump back to the White House.\n\nBut as he prepares to give his first joint address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump will face a nation starting to grow skeptical of his ability to achieve one of his core campaign promises ‒ lowering their cost of living.\n\nA poll from Marist University/NPR released on the eve of Trump's address found 57% of Americans believe grocery prices will increase over the next six months, while only 17% believe they will decrease. In the same poll, 54% of Americans said the country is moving in the wrong direction, and more Americans, by a 46%-42% margin, believe Trump's direction on the economy is for the worse than for the better.\n\nThe economic concerns comes as egg prices have soared amid ongoing bird flu outbreaks. Economists also warn that tariffs on imports, which Trump is aggressively imposing, can lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\n\"Inflation is not gone, those concerns are still there, and perhaps the Trump administration has found out that inflation is not that easy to control,\" said Erasmus Kersting , an economics professor at the Villanova School of Business.\n\nThe White House has continued to blame the policies of the Biden administration for consumer prices that increased 3% in January from a year earlier, up from 2.9% the previous month. But the longer Trump remains in office, the more difficult it could become to pin it all on his predecessor.\n\nAnd signs a jittery public on the economic outlook are mounting.\n\nPublic approval of Trump's handling of the economy dropped to 39% last month, down from 43% immediately after his inauguration, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found . Consumer confidence metrics dropped in February by the largest monthly margin since August 2021. Meanwhile, the U.S. household income is expected to grow by just 4.25%, down from a robust 5.5% last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and Moody's forecasts.\n\n\"You can only tell stories for so long,\" Kersting said, adding that while Trump \"talked the economy down\" during the 2024 presidential campaign, he's now in a problematic position of talking up the economy under his watch despite the troubling metrics.\n\n\"Something like the price of eggs or rent or people's job prospects, those are things that he can't just sort of talk away. That might be something where reality comes back and actually has political consequences for him,\" he said.\n\nTrump is expected to use his speech before Congress to give a full-throated defense of his first six weeks in office. It has included a barrage of executive actions designed to overwhelm his opponents , a ctions to close the border to migrants , new tariffs on foreign imports and an aggressive push to dismantle the federal government led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. It's unclear how much of Trump's address will be devoted to concerns about inflation and the economy.\n\n\"TOMORROW NIGHT WILL BE BIG. I WILL TELL IT LIKE IT IS!\" Trump said in a social media post previewing his address.\n\nMusk, the billionaire tech entrepreneur and White House senior adviser, is set to attend the joint address in what will be another public display of his enormous power in the Trump administration. Yet recent polling suggests Musk's influence and his DOGE efforts, including sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, present a risk politically for Trump.\n\nFifty percent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Musk, the Marist/NPR poll found, compared to 39% who have a positive opinion of him. More Americans, 44%-39%, have an unfavorable than favorable opinion of DOGE. And 55% of Americans said they believe Trump's layoffs of federal workers and cuts to government funding will do more harm than good.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday defended DOGE's actions, pointing to a Harvard CAPS / Harris Poll from last month that found 76% of Americans support a \"full-scale effort to find and eliminate fraud and waste in government.\"\n\n\"President Trump has his finger on the pulse of the American public, he knows what they elected him to do, and he's committed to doing it,\" Leavitt said in an appearance on Fox News, adding that Trump will discuss his accomplishments \"across the board\" during his joint address.\n\nTrump's Monday announcement that he plans to move ahead with 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico sent the stock market tumbling.\n\nTrump has acknowledged there could be \"pain\" from the new tariffs on the two bordering nations but said \"it will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"\n\nKevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council in the Trump White House, said last month the combination of spending cuts and increasing the supply of goods manufactured in the U.S. will drive down inflation.\n\n\"If you have an explosion of supply and a reduction in government demand, then inflation goes way down,\" Hassett said, though cautioning: \"We're still going to see some memory of Biden's inflation. It's not going to go away in a month.\"\n\nTrump's critics, meanwhile, are seizing on the signs of economic unrest.\n\n\"We're about less than two months into this new administration which should be a honeymoon period, and yet, President Trump is already underwater quite significantly on his handling of the economy,\" Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director of Biden's National Economic Council, said in a call with reporters Monday hosted by the Groundwork Collaborative , a left-leaning advocacy group.\n\n\"That's basically unprecedented,\" Ramamurti added, \"and it demonstrates that the public understands that he's not really trying to focus on the issues that are most important to them.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "Firings, tariffs and Teslas: Donald Trump shakes up Washington\n\nWASHINGTON - To some people, President Donald Trump is shaking things up. To others, he is sowing an unusual amount of chaos and confusion in a world that has grown accustomed to confusion.\n\nIn office less than two months, Trump has dismantled government agencies and fired tens of thousands of government workers , then scrambled to hire hundreds of them back because they held crucial jobs like managing the nation's nuclear weapons .\n\nHis approach to trade - announcing abrupt and dramatic tariffs on certain imports, calling the duties off and later threatening to impose new ones - has thrown financial markets into a tailspin. U.S. stocks rebounded on Friday after a tumultuous week fueled by concerns over Trump's escalating trade war and fears of a recession , but still posted a fourth straight week of losses.\n\nTrump and Republicans are urging patience, insisting that the turbulence in the stock market is temporary and that all his disruptive measures will pay off in the long run. GOP lawmakers say they are willing to give the new president the benefit of the doubt, pointing out that he has been in office just a matter of weeks and that more time is needed to know the full impact of his policies.\n\n\"He's been in office for just over, what, 50 days? This is the 51st day in office,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., told reporters earlier this week. \"Give the president a chance to have these policies play out.\"\n\nDemocrats warn the chaos Trump has created could inflict long-term damage to the economy and accuse him of hurting the very people he said during the 2024 presidential campaign that he'd protect.\n\n\" Donald Trump is wreaking havoc across the federal government and our economy, gutting federal programs millions of hard-working people rely on, just to give billionaires like Elon Musk a free ride,\" said Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois, who leads a coalition of fiscally-moderate Democrats.\n\n\"We see the cost of Trump's chaos economy in virtually every facet of life,\" Schneider said.\n\nAngry voters have shown up at GOP town halls to protest the government cuts orchestrated by Trump and Musk, the billionaire owner of the auto manufacturer Tesla and a presidential adviser who is leading the administration's downsizing effort through the new Department of Government Efficiency .\n\nWith Trump's poll numbers starting to slide and GOP leaders urging their lawmakers to stop holding town halls, Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt., and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz , the Democratic nominee for vice president during last year's election, have started holding events in Republican states and congressional districts to emphasize the damage they say the Trump cuts would inflict.\n\nDemocrats already are looking for a glimmer of hope in the 2028 presidential election, when they will have a chance to win back the White House. Several prominent Democrats have been mentioned as possible candidates, including former Vice President Kamala Harris , who lost last year's election to Trump, as well as California Gov. Gavin Newsom , former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear .\n\nTrump, meanwhile, insists that his approach is the correct one and that the United States is on the right track.\n\n\"I think this country is going to boom,\" he told reporters Tuesday from the White House South Lawn, which he had turned into a car lot in a show of support for Tesla and Musk, who also has come under fire for his role in the government's downsizing effort.\n\n\"I could do it the easy way or the hard way,\" Trump said. \"The hard way to do it is exactly what I'm doing. But the results are going to be 20 times greater.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's approach to economic policy is unusual, economist Chris Lafakis said.\n\n\"This is not like anything that I've seen as a professional economist,\" said Lafakis, a director at Moody's Analytics.\n\nUnder federal law, changing regulations involves a multi-step process that includes proposing a new rule, eliciting and evaluating feedback and then rolling out a policy.\n\nBut the speed and the scale of what Trump is doing has worked in his favor, said GOP strategist Mike DuHaime, a former political director for the Republican National Committee.\n\n\"Trump has come out at a blistering pace, which has been positive for him because his detractors don't know where to focus,\" DuHaime said.\n\nThe president, who returned to office in January, is still in the honeymoon phase and has some leeway with the public to prove his approach will work, DuHaime said.\n\nThe White House argues Trump's approach is already working.\n\n\"President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term,\" spokesman Kush Desai said.\n\nBut there are signs that many Americans are growing weary.\n\nFifty-seven percent of those surveyed in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday said Trump is being too erratic in his moves to shake up the economy. Some 70% of respondents - including nine in 10 Democrats and six in 10 Republicans - said they expected higher tariffs will make groceries and other regular purchases more expensive.\n\nTrump's poll numbers also have dipped as a result of the economic concerns. A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday put his approval rating at 42%, down from 45% a month earlier. His disapproval rating was 53%,\n\n\"Voters are waiting to see if the tariff strategy works or backfires,\" DuHaime said, \"but they are starting to worry.\"\n\nThe same goes for Trump's foreign policy approach, DuHaime said.\n\nUkraine , in the third year of its war with Russia, agreed last week to a ceasefire plan negotiated by U.S. officials. The agreement came after weeks of criticism by Trump of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Russian President Vladimir Putin , who triggered the conflict by ordering an invasion of his country's neighbor, said Thursday he supports but won't immediately agree to the ceasefire because he wants to see an \"enduring peace\" that removes the \"underlying cause\" of the crisis.\n\nIt's too soon to know whether Trump's foreign policy moves will work or be popular, DuHaime said, adding come summer the president \"owns the economic and foreign policy successes or failures.\"\n\nThe GOP holds small majorities in both the House and the Senate and is pushing hard to enact Trump's agenda before the focus turns to next year's mid-term elections.\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas, said nobody should be surprised by what Trump is doing because he's following through on campaign promises.\n\nWhile many Americans see chaos, Nehls said Trump is executing with precision an agenda he laid out during the 2024 presidential contest.\n\nThe president is able to do more because he has a team around him that he trusts, said Nehls, an ardent Trump backer who wore a T-shirt adorned with Trump's mug shot last year to Democrat Joe Biden 's final State of the Union address.\n\nMarc Short, who served as chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence during Trump's first term, said he believes much of Trump's agenda is popular, pointing to his moves on immigration and shrinking the size of government.\n\n\"I think that the big outlier on that is his trade policy,\" Short said, adding: \"If you're not getting the confidence of the American people on the economy, I think it does undermine a lot of the other agenda.\"\n\nAnnouncing tariffs and then pausing them suggests Trump is \"not entirely confident that these policies will work,\" Short said. Trump's approach seems \"very whimsical,\" Short added, but he noted that the president was very \"unpredictable\" during his first term too.\n\nThe spending cuts identified by the Musk and his team have added to the confusion, with mass layoffs, surprise government-wide emails and the dismantling of agencies. This week, the Department of Education - which Trump has vowed to eliminate - slashed its workforce in half, laying off roughly 1,300 workers and leaving the agency hamstrung to fulfill responsibilities it's required by law to carry out.\n\nA federal judge in California ordered the administration on Thursday to reinstate tens of thousands of probationary workers who had been fired in six departments. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco said the manner in which the workers were fired was illegal.\n\nTrump also has choreographed some curious moments since his return to office, most recently his White House event to promote Tesla vehicles alongside Musk, the company's founder. Musk's efforts have sparked protests at Tesla dealerships. Some dealerships have been vandalized. The company's stock has dipped.\n\nPushing back, Trump warned at the White House event that violence against Tesla would be labeled as domestic terrorism .\n\nIn a twist, some of Trump's moves are aimed at undoing clean-air rules that were enacted by Biden and were meant to encourage Americans to buy more electric vehicles like those Musk's company makes.\n\n\"I think that one anecdote was very surreal and ironic,\" Short said of the Tesla White House event. \"Because conservatives have long opposed taxpayer subsidies that prop up electric vehicle business. And yet there couldn't have been a bigger promotion than having events on the White House lawn.\"\n\nNehls argued the media has overplayed the confusion caused by Trump's tariffs and firing of federal workers and is \"scaring people.\" He pointed to Trump's comments to a joint session of Congress on March 4 that while his tariffs will cause \"a little disturbance ... it won't be much.\"\n\n\"Trump made it very clear ... it's going to be a little bumpy, but have faith and confidence he knows what he's doing, and it will be fine,\" Nehls said.\n\nNehls predicted the markets will bounce back and said the policy is an important step toward fair trade and reviving American manufacturing.\n\nFor many conservatives, the moves Trump is making are the fulfillment of long-held dreams.\n\nTina Descovich, co-founder of the conservative activist group Moms for Liberty , talked about eliminating the Department of Education nearly a decade ago when she ran for school board in Brevard County, Florida. Last week, she was on a call with officials at the department to receive a briefing about the cuts before they were publicly announced.\n\nThe deep cuts have raised questions about how the U.S. government will carry out various education programs, but Descovich argued they were done in a \"thoughtful manner\" that protected essential functions.\n\nMore broadly, she said, Trump is delivering on an agenda that has been well thought out. She noted that Trump allies spent years creating policy plans to implement when he returned to power and now are rolling them out.\n\n\"Change is always hard for people,\" said Descovich, who was at the White House recently when Trump signed an executive order banning transgender student athletes from competing in women's sports.\n\nBut the change Trump is delivering will be beneficial, she said.\n\n\"The bureaucratic nightmare, swampland of D.C. is a tough one to slay,\" Descovich said, but Trump \"is slaying the swamp. And that is what America wants, ultimately. Doesn't mean it's not going to be a little painful sometimes. Doesn't mean it's not going to be a little bumpy. But it is necessary for our strong American future.\"\n\nContributing: Sudiksha Kochi\n\nFollow Zac Anderson on X @zacjanderson and Collins @mcollinsNEWS"

      "text": "Lara Trump plans to interview President Donald Trump, Democrats on new Fox show\n\nLara Trump is returning to her former home.\n\nThe former Republican National Committee co-chair is back at Fox News Channel with \"My View with Lara Trump,\" a Saturday night (9 p.m. ET) opinion show that launched Feb. 22.\n\nIn doing so, she has passed up a Cabinet position in her father-in-law President Donald Trump 's second White House term and another chance at serving in the United States Senate, making history as the first family member of a sitting president to host a television program. She is the wife of President Trump's middle son, Eric, and the pair share two children, Luke and Carolina.\n\n\"The show is to really bring another level of transparency to things that I don't know that we've ever had,\" Trump told USA TODAY. \"You know, you look at Donald Trump . I think people would be hard pressed to find a more transparent candidate and administration than we currently have.\"\n\nTrump, who is known to go to new terrain for conservatives, such as her viral appearance on the radio show \"The Breakfast Club\" last October, says she would like to invite Democrats on the show - and interview the president.\n\nAfter Fox News announced her hiring , criticism followed. The Daily Beast said she tried and failed to paint her father-in-law as \"pro-feminist\" after Trump featured female Trump administration officials Pam Bondi, Tulsi Gabbard and Karoline Leavitt. The New Yorker coined her \"The New Trump-Family Megaphone,\" but she disagrees with the backlash.\n\n\"Oh, you mean someone would criticize something that a Trump did?\" Trump says. \"Of course there will be critics. Of course there will be people who say that,\" referring to \"megaphone\" headline. That \"is not the intent of the show.\"\n\nShe has a clear plan, though, for \"My View,\" which is already a ratings hit. As left-leaning news networks MSNBC and CNN reshuffle their talent amid President Trump's second term, axing his critics or offering them lesser time slots, \"My View\" garnered the most viewers of any cable program over its opening weekend, according to Nielsen ratings.\n\nThe show beat out ESPN college basketball with 2.4 million viewers ahead of March Madness.\n\nTrump tells USA TODAY the president thought the first episode was \"amazing,\" and she praised him as her \"biggest cheerleader.\"\n\n\"He's called me twice since the show to tell me what an amazing job he thought I did, how much he enjoyed the show and unfortunately, both times, I missed his call,\" Trump says, adding that her phone was dead and she was on a plane during the respective attempts.\n\n\"I'm really grateful, and I'm happy (President Trump) loved it,\" she says. \"Of course, he told me that the only way that I was going to get a huge audience is if I had him on, and so I think that - I don't want to say I've proven him wrong. When he comes on, I guess the audience will be even bigger.\"\n\nFor those wondering when her father-in-law will make his \"My View\" debut, Trump says she would like to have him on the show after he hits 100 days in office.\n\n\"I really wanted to establish myself in this position before having him on. So, you know, we'll see. We don't have anything officially planned.\"\n\nShe insists she's carving her own lane on Fox News and praised President Trump's administration in her interview with USA TODAY.\n\nTrump decided to host her new Fox show to \"bring an extra layer of transparency and more information, not less information, to people out there.\"\n\n\"You know what side I'm on, you know for whom I voted, and you know that I obviously want to see this country succeed with my father-in-law as president, but I think anyone who tunes into the show regularly will very quickly learn that I'm simply trying to give more insights.\"\n\nHer dream guests? Her own family.\n\n\"I actually would love to do an interview with my whole family, and I would love for people see because I don't know that's anyone's ever done that, just the way we all interact I think is very cool,\" she says. \"And I think, you know, people love to write articles about this, that and the other. We all get along so well. I think the past eight years have made us all closer.\"\n\nShe also wants to invite Democrats, suggesting moderate Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman and HBO talk show host Bill Maher .\n\nAnd the show's cheeky title isn't throwing shade at \"The View,\" the ABC daytime hit show famously critical of the president.\n\n\"Some took it as a swipe at 'The View,' but mostly it's because it is really what this show is all about. It's my view on things and my perspective,\" she says, adding that the name is simple and straightforward.\n\nTrump did divulge that she \"probably would have said yes\" to co-hosting \"The View.\" When asked if producers had ever asked her, she said, \"Not to my knowledge.\"\n\nTo host \"My View,\" Trump took her name out of consideration to replace Marco Rubio , her father-in-law's pick for secretary of state, in the U. S. Senate representing Florida, where she now lives. She also was floated as a Senate candidate in 2022 in her home state, North Carolina.\n\nMotherhood is more important, she says. \"For me, being the mom of two young kids who are 5 and 7 right now, my kids need me. They want me around. That doesn't last forever. There will come a point where they're like, 'Get away, Mom. We don't need you around here.'\"\n\nShe shoots the show in locations around the country.\n\n\"With that in mind, this great opportunity at Fox came up, and I said, you know, 'It just feels like this is the position that God is pushing me in. There's a reason you don't see a lot of moms of school-age children as United States senators.\" There are four moms of school-aged children in the Senate.\n\n\"It's not that they don't have the drive to do it. It's very challenging to be away from your children if you don't move them fully to D.C. for the amount of time it's necessary to do the job of United States senator.\"\n\nFor now, the \"No Days Off\" singer says the Senate can wait. Voters can find her seated on the anchor desk every Saturday, giving her view.\n\n\"I actually hope that maybe we bring new people into the fold to tune in to Fox because of this show because I do think you're getting something that is different, that isn't solely based on the frenzied 24-hour news cycle that we're all used to,\" she says.\n\n\"I think it's hard sometimes to take a second to take a breath and really appreciate the people who are making the big changes right now. And that's truly what I hope to highlight.\"\n\n\"My View\" airs Saturday nights on Fox. The March 8 episode will feature Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy , Florida gubernatorial candidate U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy."

      "text": "Trump drops order against law firm after it pledges $40 million in legal services\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident Donald Trump agreed to withdraw an executive order targeting law firm Paul Weiss' contracts and employee security clearances in exchange for a series of commitments from the firm, including dedicating $40 million of free legal services to \"mutually agreed projects,\" Trump announced.\n\nThe March 14 executive order commanded agency heads to suspend security clearances for the firm's lawyers and threatened to snatch away government contracts for firm clients.\n\nPaul Weiss is the third law firm targeted by Trump since late February. The pattern has sparked concerns among free speech advocates and legal observers about the independence of law firms under the new administration.\n\nFor some, Paul Weiss' agreement, announced late Thursday in a Trump post on Truth Social, heightened those concerns.\n\n\"This Paul Weiss capitulation is the most disgraceful action by a major law firm in my lifetime, so appalling that I couldn't believe it at first,\" posted lawyer George Conway, a prominent Republican-turned-Independent Trump critic, on X.\n\nAsked by a reporter Friday how he would respond to critics who say the executive actions targeting law firms amount to coercion, Trump was unfazed.\n\n\"Well, the law firms all want to make deals,\" he said from the Oval Office.\n\nIn targeting Paul Weiss, the March 14 executive order cited its former hire of ex-New York prosecutor Mark Pomerantz , who wrote in a letter published in the New York Times in 2022 that Trump was \"guilty of numerous felony violations.\" The letter was written before Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg secured an indictment - and later a conviction - against Trump on charges of falsifying business records. Trump has appealed the conviction .\n\n\"The President is agreeing to this action in light of a meeting with Paul, Weiss Chairman, Brad Karp, during which Mr. Karp acknowledged the wrongdoing of former Paul, Weiss partner, Mark Pomerantz, the grave dangers of Weaponization, and the vital need to restore our System of Justice,\" a White House statement accompanying Trump's Thursday announcement said.\n\nThe executive order marked a significant potential threat to the firm's business. Trump ordered agency heads to require government contractors to disclose any business they do with Paul Weiss and whether that business is related to the contract's subject - suggesting the administration may cancel contracts for some of Weiss' clients, not just any direct contracts with the firm.\n\nOther firm clients or potential clients may have also feared an association with the firm would bring them in the government's crosshairs. One client of the firm, former legal executive of Cognizant Technology Solutions Steven Schwartz, decided to terminate the firm as defense legal counsel due to the executive order, the firm said in a Wednesday court filing .\n\nTrump also suspended security clearances on Feb. 25 for lawyers at Covington & Burling who helped former special counsel Jack Smith. Smith secured two indictments against Trump but dropped the charges after Trump won the 2024 election .\n\nIn a March 6 executive order , Trump targeted security clearances and contracts for law firm Perkins Coie, which has filed a lawsuit alleging the executive order is unconstitutional. A Washington, D.C. federal judge issued a temporary restraining order March 12 halting several restrictions in the order.\n\nThe executive orders targeting Perkins Coie and Paul Weiss also stated that the administration objected to what it described as diversity, equity, and inclusion policies at the firms. Trump suggested Paul Weiss acceded to the administration's demands on that front as part of its agreement.\n\n\"Paul, Weiss affirms its commitment to merit-based hiring, promotion, and retention, and will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies,\" according to Trump's announcement. \"As part of its commitment, it will engage experts, to be mutually agreed upon within 14 days, to conduct a comprehensive audit of all of its employment practices.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Paul Weiss didn't immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nAccording to Trump's Truth Social post, Paul Weiss Chairman Brad Karp said of the agreement, \"We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.\"\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers\n\nThis story was updated with additional information.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Law firm Paul Weiss makes deal with Trump to escape executive order"

      "text": "Billionaire Trump Official Says Missing Social Security Checks Are No Big Deal\n\nManage your account\n\nHoward Lutnick, Donald Trump's billionaire commerce secretary, suggested on a podcast this week that missing Social Security checks aren't a big deal, and that only a \"fraudster\" would actually complain if their monthly benefit didn't come in the mail.\n\n\"Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month,\" Lutnick said on the All-In podcast. \"My mother-in-law is 94. She wouldn't call and complain. She just wouldn't. She would think something got messed up and she'll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise screaming, yelling, and complaining.\"\n\n\"The easiest way to find a fraudster is to stop payments and listen,\" he continued. \"Whoever screamed is the one stealing.\"\n\nLutnick's comments come as Elon Musk and his minions from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have invaded the Social Security Administration, implementing big changes and leading Americans to worry that their benefits could be in danger.\n\nDOGE has pushed to close dozens of Social Security offices and limit phone services . The Social Security Administration (SSA), which has plans to slash its workforce , announced earlier this week that it will no longer allow people to verify their identities by phone, forcing them to come into brick-and-mortar field offices. The changes could overwhelm the agency's staff and delay access to benefits.\n\nThe AARP, a powerful advocacy group for seniors, was livid about the latest proposed change. \"The Social Security Administration's move to force people to visit offices in-person for services that they have sought by phone will result in more headaches and longer wait times to resolve routine customer service needs,\" the AARP wrote in a statement . \"Requiring rural Americans to go into an office can mean having to take a day off of work and drive for hours merely to fill out paperwork.\" The AARP continued to stress the change could result in \"real economic hardship\" for older Americans.\n\nLutnick - a billionaire whose in-laws are also affluent - doesn't seem to understand this, to say the least.\n\nThe federal judiciary has been thwarting some of the ostensibly illegal moves the Trump administration has made to take over Social Security, including by blocking the Social Security Administration from allowing Musk and DOGE to access the sensitive private data of hundreds of millions of Americans. Lee Dudek, whom Trump named acting administrator of the SSA, was so miffed by the ruling that he threatened to shut down Social Security entirely . \"Really, I want to turn it off and let the courts figure out how they want to run a federal agency,\" he said on Thursday, per Bloomberg .\n\nSocial Security going dark would endanger the welfare of millions upon millions of older and disabled Americans who rely on the benefit program to live.\n\nLutnick seems more concerned with the welfare of the world's richest man.\n\nEarlier his week, he went on Fox News and begged viewers to buy Tesla stock, which has been tanking as Musk continues to fire federal employees and dismantle essential government services. The Campaign Legal Center called for an investigation into the plea on Friday, calling Lutnick's remarks an \"apparently flagrant violation of federal law\" barring public officials from using their offices for private gain.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nFormer Social Security Chief Courts Florida Seniors Enraged by Musk's Cuts\n\nWhy DOGE Having Your Social Security Data Is Dangerous\n\nTrump Admin Threatens to Stop Social Security If DOGE Can't Have Personal Data\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nThe Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign\n\nAnatomy of a Fake News Scandal\n\nThe Radical Crusade of Mike Pence\n\nSign up for RollingStone's Newsletter .

      "text": "Trump weighs in on report King Charles will offer U.S. membership to British Commonwealth: 'Sounds good!'\n\nManage your account\n\nNearly 250 years after America declared independence from Great Britain, President Donald Trump suggested he was open to taking a small step back towards the warm embrace of the British monarchy after a media outlet reported that King Charles III intends to extend an offer for the United States to join the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThe King is reportedly preparing to extend the offer of \"associate membership\" in the voluntary association of 56 nations, most of which have history as former British colonies. Trump, it seems, is open to the idea.\n\nWriting on his Truth Social platform while sharing an article referencing the unprecedented offer, Trump said: \"I Love King Charles. Sounds good to me!\"\n\nFirst reported by the Daily Mail , the offer from Charles III would be formally extended during the planned state visit by Trump to the U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer delivered a hand-written invitation from the King to the U.S. leader during a visit to the White House last month.\n\nA member of the Royal Commonwealth Society told the Mail that the possibility of America making entry into the Commonwealth is \"being discussed at the highest levels\" as \"a wonderful move that would symbolize Britain's close relationship with the U.S.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump loves Britain and has great respect for the Royal Family, so we believe he would see the benefits of this. Associate membership could, hopefully, be followed by full membership, making the Commonwealth even more important as a global organization,\" the person added.\n\nHaving America joining the Commonwealth, even as an associate member, could be a way for Charles to smooth over tensions between Washington, London and Ottawa that have erupted over Trump's frequently-stated desire to make Canada - a Commonwealth founding member and one of the 15 nations that still counts the King as head of state - the 51st American state rather than the fully independent nation it has been since the 1982 Canadian constitution removed the country's vestigial legal dependence on the British parliament.\n\nTrump's rhetoric towards America's northern neighbor, which which it shares the world's largest unguarded land border, has inflamed passions among Canadians who've taken umbrage at what has amounted to an unprovoked trade war waged by American leaders.\n\nThe president has imposed tariffs on many Canadian imports and threatened to raise the import taxes - which are ultimately paid by American consumers - even higher, while claiming that the U.S. trade deficit with Canada amounts to an unfair subsidy of Ottawa by Washington.\n\nIf membership is offered and accepted, no longer would America send an ambassador to the Court of St James as it has done since John Adams presented his credentials to King George III in June 1785. Washington's emissary to Ottawa would no longer be an ambassador, either, and neither would the top diplomats sent by the U.K. or Canada to the U.S. That's because Commonwealth nations appoint \"high commissioners\" to represent each other's interests in their respective capitals.\n\nThe 56-member bloc has roots in the post-Second World War era when the U.K. began divesting itself of its massive colonial empire. And Canada, the subject of current tensions with the U.S., was the first member.\n\nMost, but not all, of the current Commonwealth members are former British dominions or colonies.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent."

      "text": "How do Americans feel about President Trump? What approval ratings show after 2 busy months\n\nManage your account\n\n(Story has been updated to add more information.)\n\nThursday marked two months since President Donald Trump was sworn into office for his second term.\n\nWhile Trump's net approval ratings came out of the gates higher than in 2017, though still lower than those of any other president in modern history, recent polls show public sentiment more split, or in some cases more negative.\n\nBy late February, just one month into his term, his net approval rating - which is calculated as the difference between a president's approval and disapproval polling averages - had shrunk to nearly even.\n\nSince then, Trump has marched on with federal agency cuts and has continued to feature Elon Musk in a central role in his administration, both of which are controversial with voters, multiple polls have shown.\n\nMany modern presidents have seen their approval ratings gradually dip throughout their first year in office as they exit the so-called \"honeymoon period.\"\n\nHere is what polls tell us about how Americans approve of Trump's second presidency so far.\n\nTwo months later, Trump's approval ratings did not show a major shift from the beginning of his term or compared with his first term, according to Costas Panagopoulos, head of political science at Northeastern University.\n\nBut he also said voters may continue to have reservations about the administration's priorities as the early policies unfold, especially as inflation continues and the stock market tries to recover from a tumble that started in February.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who dismissed other claims and comments that he made during the campaign because they expected that his priorities would be in line with things that they wanted,\" he told USA TODAY in an interview Thursday, mentioning the economy and inflation as examples. \"Now they're seeing well that might not be the case.\"\n\nBut crucial to understanding Trump's approval ratings, Panagopoulos says, is the Republican and Democratic parties, because Trump's approval ratings come from an already polarized electorate.\n\nWhile Democrats are fragmented, Republicans are putting forward a \"united front\" in supporting Trump, according to Panagopoulos.\n\n\"At least for now, that might be artificially inflating Trump's approval numbers overall, but specifically among Republicans,\" he said. \"People are not going to move away from Trump until they have an alternative they can move towards.\"\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\nNBC News:\n\nMore respondents disapprove of Trump's job than approve by a margin of 4 percentage points (poll conducted March 7-11; 1,000 registered voters; margin of error ±3.1 percentage points).\n\nThe poll found that more respondents today believe the executive and judicial branches have too much power than when asked about the same thing in 2019, according to NBC News.\n\nEconomist/YouGov :\n\nMore respondents have an unfavorable view of Trump than a favorable view, by a margin of 51% to 46% (poll conducted March 16-18; 1,618 U.S. adults; ±3.4 percentage points).\n\nDemocrats in Congress have become \"much less popular in the past few months,\" while Republicans in Congress have become more popular, according to YouGov.\n\nFifty percent of respondents to the poll somewhat or strongly oppose the recent layoffs of federal workers by the Department of Government Efficiency, compared to 38% who support the layoffs.\n\nMorning Consult :\n\nMorning Consult's measure of Trump's approval ratings has flipped net negative for the first time since he took office, with more respondents disapproving of his job performance (50%) than those who approve (48%). (Poll conducted March 14-16; 2,210 registered voters; margin of error ±2 percentage points.)\n\nTrump's approval rating with Morning Consult turned net negative a week later during Trump's first presidency.\n\n\"More voters than not still approve of Trump's handling of most issues, with the president receiving his best marks on immigration (55% approval) and national security (52% approve),\" Morning Consult states.\n\nRMG Research/Napolitan News Service :\n\n54% of respondents either strongly approve or somewhat approve of Trump's job, compared with 44% who disapprove, strongly or somewhat (poll taken March 6-13; 3,000 registered voters; margin of error ±1.8 percentage points).\n\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Legal experts say Trump official broke law by saying 'Buy Tesla' stock but don't expect a crackdown\n\nManage your account\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - When a White House adviser in the first Trump administration told TV viewers to \"Go buy Ivanka stuff,\" top government lawyers sprang into action, telling her she had violated ethics rules and warning her not to do it again.\n\nGovernment ethics experts have varying opinions on whether the 2017 criticism of Kellyanne Conway went far enough, but many agree such violations now might not even draw an official rebuke.\n\nA week after President Donald Trump turned the White House lawn into a Tesla infomercial for Elon Musk's cars , a second sales pitch by a U.S. official occurred, this time for Tesla stock.\n\n\"It will never be this cheap,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Wednesday. \"Buy Tesla.\"\n\nGovernment ethics experts say Lutnick broke a 1989 law prohibiting federal employees from using \"public office for private gain,\" later detailed to include a ban on \"endorsements.\" Although presidents are generally exempt from government ethics rules, most federal employees are not and are often punished for violations, including rebukes like the one Conway got .\n\nAs of Friday, no public action had been taken against Lutnick and it was unclear whether he would suffer a similar fate.\n\n\"They're not even thinking of ethics,\" said Trump critic and former Republican White House ethics czar Richard Painter of administration officials.\n\nPainter has equally low expectations of that other possible brake to future violations - public opinion: \"I don't know if people care.\"\n\nIn his first term, Trump opened his hotel near the Oval Office to foreign ambassadors and lobbyists in what many legal scholars argued was a violation of a constitutional ban against presidents receiving payments or gifts that could distort public policy for private gain. His company launched a new hotel chain called \"America Idea\" in hopes of cashing in on his celebrity. Trump even once proposed holding a G-7 meeting of world leaders at his then-struggling Doral golf resort.\n\nThe 'Buy Ivanka' rebuke\n\nBut the reaction to Conway's \"Ivanka stuff\" comment suggested certain lines couldn't be crossed.\n\nWithin days of Conway's TV comments, the head of the federal ethics agency, the Office of Government Ethics, wrote a letter to the White House saying Trump's adviser may have broken the law and urging a probe. A White House lawyer then met with Conway to remind her of the law and reported to the ethics office that she had assured him she would abide by it in future.\n\nBut this time, there is no head of the Office of Government Ethics. He was fired by Trump. Ditto for the inspector generals of various agencies who would head any investigation.\n\n\"What is likely to happen now? I really don't know,\" said Kedric Payne, chief lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center, a non-profit watchdog that sent a letter to the government ethics office on Friday calling for an investigation. \"We no longer have the head of the Office of Government Ethics to push the Commerce Department to make sure the secretary acknowledges the law.\"\n\nPayne said Lutnick's comment on TV may seem like a small transgression but it could snowball into a bigger problem if not punished.\n\n\"It starts with one TV appearance, but can develop into multiple officials asking people to support companies and products,\" Payne said. \"If there are no consequences, you get into a danger zone of a corruption.\"\n\nTrump critics point to other signs that Trump is careless with the law and ethical norms, citing his pardons for Jan. 6 Capitol rioters , a decision to allow his Trump Organization to strike business deals abroad and his attack on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act banning U.S. company bribes abroad to win business.\n\nJelly beans and airlines\n\nWhen it comes endorsing products, presidents used to be far more circumspect.\n\nTheir comments were mostly quick asides expressing opinions of taste, such as when Harry Truman called Pillsbury flour the \"finest\" or John F. Kennedy said United Airlines was \"reliable.\"\n\nRonald Reagan famously enthused about his jelly beans habit, remarking that they were the \"perfect snack.\"\n\nTrump had five Teslas lined up in the White House driveway last week as he praised Musk's company . Then he slipped into a red Model S he had targeted for personal purchase, exclaiming, \"Wow. That's beautiful.\"\n\n\"Presidents are allowed to have personal opinions on products they like and dislike,\" said ethics lawyer Kathleen Clark, referring to the Truman through Reagan examples. \"But what Trump did was transform the White House into a set for advertising the products of a private company.\"\n\n\"It's the difference between holding an extravaganza and holding an opinion.\"\n\nCalls for Musk investigation\n\nIn the aftermath of the Tesla White House event, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and three other senators wrote a letter to the Office of Government Ethics saying that, while presidents are exempt from ethics law banning endorsements, Elon Musk isn't and calling for an investigation.\n\nA spokeswoman from Warren's office said the government ethics office had not yet responded about what it planned to do about the White House Tesla endorsement. The Office of Government Ethics itself said it would not comment on either the Warren letter or Lutnick's TV appearance.\n\nThe Commerce Department did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment.\n\nAsked whether Lutnick would be reprimanded or an investigation opened, White House spokesman Kush Desai defended Lutnick, lauding \"his immensely successful private sector career\" and his \"critical role on President Trump's trade and economic team.\"\n\nFormer White House ethics chief Painter says Democrats have also played loose with the ethics law.\n\nHe is harshly critical of the Clinton charity, the Clinton Foundation, which was taking donations from foreign governments when Hillary Clinton was the country's chief diplomat as secretary of state. Painter also blasts former President Joe Biden for not removing his name from a University of Pennsylvania research institute when he was in office even though it appeared to be helping draw donations overseas.\n\nBut Painter says the slide from caring about ethics laws and norms to defiance has hit a new low.\n\n\"There's been a deterioration in ethics,\" he said. \"What Biden did wasn't good, but this is worse.\""

She owes me a totally discredited Pulitzer Prize for her bad reporting.\"\n\nTrump yelled: \"The Fake News is the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE...And Elon is NOT BEING BRIEFED ON ANYTHING CHINA BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WAR!!!\"\n\nMusk also addressed The Times' report that he would be briefed on the nation's China war plans. He said on X on Friday that he looked forward to \"the prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information to NYT.\"\n\n\"The New York Times is pure propaganda,\" he added."

As Trump prepares to return to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, we take a look at where his relatives will go next.\n\nMelania Trump, who returns to the White House as First Lady for a second term, has been married to Trump since 2005.\n\nShe maintained a low profile during Trump's first term in office and has made few public appearances since.\n\nIn July, she made an unexpected appearance at the convention, just days after an attempt on her husband's life.\n\nIn a memoir released in October, she shared her pro-choice stance on abortion. Her position is in contrast with that of her husband who has taken credit for helping overturn Roe v Wade, upending the constitutional right to abortion.\n\nHer return to Washington was up in the air but in January she clarified she will split her time: \"I will be in the White House. And you know, when I need to be in New York, I will be in New York. When I need to be in Palm Beach, I will be in Palm Beach.\"\n\nBarron Trump has largely stayed out of the spotlight during campaigning.\n\nIn May, it was reported he would be among the delegates from the state of Florida attending the convention in July, but a day later his mother stated that he had declined the offer.\n\nHe graduated from Oxbridge Academy in Palm Beach, Florida, in May and his father says he is now studying at Stern School of Business at New York University.\n\nDonald Trump Jr, the eldest of the Trump children, has taken on a larger role in the years since his father left the White House.\n\nHe was prominent in the media during the selection of Trump's running-mate JD Vance who, he says, is a friend. \"It's an incredible pick,\" he said at the Republican National Convention (RNC). \"Truly a great choice.\"\n\nHe made no secret Ohio Senator JD Vance was his first pick and he got his wish.\n\nDonald Trump Jr was previously married to Vanessa Trump, with whom he shares five children. He is now engaged to Kimberly Guilfoyle.\n\nHe reportedly has accepted a job with an investment firm called 1789 Capital which opposes \"excessive bureaucracy\" and focuses on conservative ideas such as \"deglobalization,\" according to its website.\n\nLike his brother, Eric Trump, the third of Trump's children, has lobbied his father about issues important to him, according to reports.\n\nHe has kept a less public persona than his older brother but also maintains a leading presence in the Trump family business.\n\nIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner were arguably the most influential family members during Trump's first stint in the White House.\n\nThe pair have been married since 2009 and share three children.\n\nDuring Trump's time in office, Ivanka made numerous appearances on behalf of her father and his administration.\n\nBut Ivanka said she would not be returning to Washington, in part because her children are older this time around.\n\n\"The main reason I am not going back to serve now is I know the cost, and it's a price that I'm not willing to make my kids bear,\" she said on podcast in January.\n\nMr Kushner held a senior adviser role in the White House from 2017 to 2021.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what his role in a second Trump administration might be, but his father, Charles Kushner, has been appointed US ambassador to France.\n\nThe fourth child of the former president and the only one of Trump's children born to his second wife, Marla Maples.\n\nShe has not maintained any political role in her father's campaigns or time in the White House.\n\nShe has been married to Michael Boulos since 2022 and they are expecting their first child later this year.\n\nHer father-in-law, Massad Boulos, was selected by Trump to serve as senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs.\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr were together for six years and engaged since 2020.\n\nTabloids have spotted the president's eldest son holding hands with another woman - making the current status of their relationship unclear.\n\nShe was a Fox News presenter from 2006 to 2018, before leaving to become a member of a pro-Trump super PAC (political action committee).\n\nGuilfoyle has been an outspoken supporter of Trump, particularly in TV appearances, which led to her nomination as US ambassador to Greece in the second Trump administration.\n\nShe was married to California Governor Gavin Newsom in the early 2000s.\n\nMarried to Eric, she is the rising star of the family, particularly since she began serving as Republican National Committee co-chair earlier this year. She has two children with Eric.\n\nIn July, she gave a speech at the convention and spoke warmly of her father-in-law.\n\n\"Our family has faced our fair share of death threats... none of that prepares you as a daughter-in-law to watch in real time someone try to kill a person you love,\" she said.\n\nHer name was floated as a potential replacement for Florida Senator Marco Rubio who was nominated to be Secretary of State, but she ultimately withdrew her name from consideration.\n\nLara said she has a big announcement to share in January, without giving further details.\n\nKai Trump is the eldest of Trump's grandchildren and the daughter of Donald Trump Jr and his former wife Vanessa Trump.\n\nThe 17-year-old is a keen golfer and spoke at the convention about what Trump is like as a grandfather.\n\n\"To me, he's just a normal grandpa.

      "text": "Trump declares border emergency and seeks to end US birthright citizenship\n\nFrom behind his desk in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders and decrees aimed at cracking down on immigration.\n\nFrom one order tackling the definition of birthright citizenship, to another declaring illegal immigration at the border a national emergency, Trump swiftly made moves on his promises to tighten the US-Mexico border.\n\nBut some of his plans - particularly around changing the definition of birthright citizenship - are likely to face significant hurdles.\n\nHe is already facing legal challenges from immigration advocacy groups, which have reacted furiously to his announcements.\n\nOne organisation said his plans \"do not uphold American values\", and another said Trump's administration was \"actively trying to destroy our lives\".\n\nIn his inaugural address earlier in the day, Trump vowed that \"all illegal entry will be halted\" and that millions of \"criminal aliens\" would be deported.\n\nHe also signed an order declaring Mexican drug cartels terrorist organisations. \"I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions,\" he explained.\n\nAt another event at Washington's Capital One Arena, Trump formally revoked nearly 80 executive actions of his predecessor Joe Biden. He had previously vowed to scrap Biden's policies \"within five minutes\".\n\nFollowing his inauguration, he also signed a proclamation that gave officials the authority to \"repel, repatriate, or remove\" migrants until he was satisfied that \"the invasion at the southern border has ceased\".\n\nAlthough the details of the order are not yet known, officials have said that Trump plans to end birthright citizenship.\n\nThat refers to an approach of the US government whereby anyone born on American soil is considered a citizen at birth, regardless of their parents' immigration status.\n\nTrump appears to be seeking to change the rules so that that the children of undocumented migrants living in the US will no longer automatically be considered US citizens. It would not apply retrospectively.\n\nExactly how he intends to achieve this is unclear, however, because birthright citizenship is enshrined in the constitution and would require a two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress to change.\n\nTrump has instructed federal agencies to stop issuing documentation to children born in the US to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas, which could effectively deny them access to public services.\n\nAdvocacy group the American Civil Liberties Union (ALCU) immediately said it was suing the Trump administration over the order. \"Denying citizenship to US-born children is not only unconstitutional - it's also a reckless and ruthless repudiation of American values,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe new administration has also moved to swiftly scrap CBP One, a mobile application used by migrants to book appointments to appear at a port of entry.\n\nBiden administration officials had credited the app with helping reduce the number of detentions at the border since it was first introduced in January 2023. It was the only legal pathway to request asylum at the US-Mexico border.\n\nNow, the Customs and Border Protection website notes that the app is \"no longer available\".\n\nApp users also now are shown a message noting that \"existing appointments scheduled through CBP One are no longer valid\".\n\nAccording to CBS, the BBC's US partner, the Biden administration had scheduled roughly 30,000 appointments via CBP One for migrants to enter the US in the next three weeks.\n\nOther estimates had suggested that as many as 270,000 migrants were in Mexico waiting for an opportunity to enter the US using CBP One.\n\nIn the Mexican border city of Tijuana, some migrants reported feeling defeated and deflated after learning of CBP One's demise.\n\n\"I hope God touches his [Trump's] heart,\" said Oralia, a Mexican woman who fled cartel violence in her home state along with her epileptic son. \"We really do need the help.\"\n\nShe had been waiting for an appointment through CBP One for seven months.\n\nAmong his other day-one moves, Trump ordered a shutdown of another Biden-era initiative, which allowed up to 30,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly to the US per month. Like the CBP One app, it was designed to lower the number of illegal crossings.\n\nImmigration advocacy groups have reacted furiously to Trump's various orders.\n\nAs well as the criticism from the ACLU, the president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum said the orders were \"disappointing but not surprising\".\n\n\"The expected orders would separate families and weaken our economy,\" Jennie Murray's statement continued. \"They do not uphold American values.\"\n\nGreisa Martinez Rosas, the executive director of United We Dream - a national immigrant youth organisation - said that the orders show that the administration \"will spend the next four years actively trying to destroy our lives\".\n\n\"Trump's pledges to carry out mass raids and deportations will have devastating consequences on communities nationwide, leaving millions of families and individuals in disarray if immediate action is not taken by our elected officials to publicly fight back,\" she added.\n\n(With additional reporting from Will Grant in Mexico)\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump faces moment of reckoning on trade after delaying tariffs\n\nFor the first week of Donald Trump's presidency, tariffs - a favourite talking point during last year's presidential campaign - were the dogs that didn't bark.\n\nTrade seemed to take a back seat while the new administration pressed ahead on immigration enforcement, pardons of Capitol riot convictions, a fossil-fuel energy policy and federal workforce upheaval - among a range of other disruptive new measures.\n\nThat all changed this past weekend when Trump announced sweeping 25% tariffs on US allies Canada and Mexico, along with 10% duties on Chinese imports.\n\nAnd while he has since delayed imposing those tariffs on his North American neighbours for a month after both countries agreed new border measures, the president still faces a moment of reckoning in which he will ultimately have to decide whether to match his rhetoric with action.\n\nTrump often talks of the trade deficits between the US and its two neighbours as a key source of his dissatisfaction. If that's the case, then no amount of new border security or drug seizures - whatever the metrics or specific demands - will make the president fully abandon his tariff threats.\n\nTrump has also said he views tariffs not just as a tool to achieve policy objectives, but as a permanent source of US revenue and a means to fund government programmes and reduce the budget deficit. And if that is his ultimate objective, then tariffs on America's largest trading partners may be the only effective answer.\n\nGlobal financial markets reeled at this prospect on Monday, as the US appeared on the brink of waging a multi-front trade war with some of its closest economic partners.\n\nThen, after conversations with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump put the tariffs on pause. While the new duties on China have gone into effect - and have prompted retaliatory measures from Beijing - markets have viewed those US moves as less disruptive and smaller in scope.\n\nBy contrast, if US had engaged in an escalating series of tariffs with Canada and Mexico, which accounted for more than $1.57tn (£1.24tn) in goods in 2023, the global economic effect could have been catastrophic.\n\nThat possibly dire development has been averted, for now, with Trump and his administration declaring at least a partial victory.\n\nThe details of what Canada and Mexico conceded, however, paint a more complicated picture.\n\nWhile Canada agreed to form a joint anti-crime strike force with the US and appoint a \"fentanyl tsar\", the concrete steps it detailed were all part of a border-security package Canada had previously announced.\n\nMexico pledged stepped up drug enforcement and 10,000 troops to patrol the US-Mexico border - but those numbers mirror the deployments the nation made in 2019 and again in 2021\n\nIn a month's time, Trump will again have to decide if Canada and Mexico are doing enough to satisfy his demands - or whether the delayed tariffs will go into effect.\n\nSolid figures demonstrating progress, however, may be hard to come by.\n\nBy the administration's own measures, US immigration officials only seized 43lbs (19.5kg) of fentanyl and caught 193,540 people crossing at the US-Canada border in 2024. The numbers are much higher for the US-Mexico border, but undocumented crossings - and drug seizures- are down there, as well.\n\nGlobal financial markets have calmed considerably since Monday morning's tariff-inspired disruption. Investors, it seems, have concluded that on trade Trump is more bluster than action.\n\nThe president may be able to extract more concessions from Canadian and Mexican leaders in a month's time, but they may also conclude at some point that Trump doesn't have the will to follow through on his threats.\n\nDespite claims of success, his sabre-rattling on trade could ultimately produce diminishing returns.\n\nAt that point, the president would have a decision to make. Does he shelve his most sweeping tariff plans for good? Were his dreams of returning the US to late-19th century trade policy - which he has said was a golden age of American economic power - unrealistic?\n\nOr does he press ahead with his vision of a new, more America-focused global trade order despite the risk of at least short-term economic pain?\n\nThat moment of reckoning has been delayed. But it is coming.\n\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second presidential term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here . Those outside the UK can sign up here .\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThousands have gathered in Rome to pay their respects to the late pontiff.\n\nThere may be opportunities for impromptu diplomacy at one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in years.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump signs order to dismantle US education department\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education, fulfilling a campaign pledge and a long-cherished goal of some conservatives.\n\nAccusing the agency of \"breath-taking failures\", the Republican president vowed to return the money it controls to individual states.\n\n\"We're going to shut it down as quickly as possible,\" Trump said, although the White House acknowledged that closing the agency outright would require an act of Congress.\n\nThe move is already facing legal challenges from those seeking to block the agency's closure as well as sweeping cuts to its staff announced last week.\n\nMost US children attend public schools, which are free and run by local officials.\n\nA common misconception is that the federal education department operates US schools and sets curriculum, but that is primarily done by states and local districts.\n\nA relatively small percentage of funding for primary and secondary schools - about 13% - comes from federal funds. Most of the money comes from state and local taxes.\n\nEstablished in 1979, the department administers student loans and runs programmes to help low-income students.\n\nBut Trump has accused it of indoctrinating young people with racial, sexual, and political material.\n\nSurrounded by children seated at school desks in the White House on Thursday, Trump said \"the US spends more money on education by far than any other country\", yet he added that students rank near the bottom of the list.\n\nThe Unesco Institute for Statistics said the US spends roughly 5.4% of its GDP on education, which is higher than many countries but not all.\n\nThe department's budget last year was $238bn (£188bn), which is less than 2% of federal spending.\n\nThe White House stated that his administration would move to cut parts of the department that remain within legal boundaries.\n\nThe executive order is likely to face legal challenges, like many of the Trump administration's efforts to shrink the size of the federal government.\n\nAt the signing ceremony, Trump praised Linda McMahon, whom he appointed to lead the department, and expressed his hope she would be the last secretary of education.\n\nHe said he would find \"something else\" for her to do within the administration.\n\nAfter Trump signed the order, Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy announced plans to bring legislation aimed at closing the department.\n\nBut Republicans hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, and closing a federal department would require 60 votes, making such a goal a longshot.\n\nBut even if the department is not formally closed, the Trump administration could decimate its funding and staff as it has done with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which subsequently stopped many of its programmes and humanitarian work.\n\nThe text of the executive order does not include specifics on what actions the administration will take and which programmes might be axed.\n\nIt orders McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure\" of the department and give authority of such matters to state and local governments.\n\nIt also directs her to ensure \"the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely\".\n\nSoon after she was sworn in, McMahon sent the department's 4,400 employees a memo titled \"Our Department's Final Mission\", a possible reference to Trump's aim to close it.\n\n\"This is our opportunity to perform one final, unforgettable public service to future generations of students,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I hope you will join me in ensuring that when our final mission is complete; we will be able to say that we left American education freer, stronger, and with more hope for the future.\"\n\nEarlier reports suggested Trump would look to end some of the department's programmes and send others to different departments, such as the Treasury, something that still may happen but wasn't made clear in his executive order.\n\nAmerica's largest teachers' union recently decried Trump's plans, saying he \"doesn't care about opportunity for all kids\".\n\nIn its statement, the American Federation of Teachers said: \"No-one likes bureaucracy, and everyone's in favour of more efficiency, so let's find ways to accomplish that.\n\n\"But don't use a 'war on woke' to attack the children living in poverty and the children with disabilities.\"\n\nFor more than 40 years, conservatives have complained about the department and floated ideas to abolish it.\n\nJust two years after it was established by Democratic President Jimmy Carter, his Republican replacement, Ronald Reagan, led calls to undo it.\n\nIt is the smallest agency in the president's cabinet and takes up less than 2% of the total federal budget.\n\nSome of those staff have already been affected by the Trump administration's sweeping workforce cuts, led by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\n\nNearly 2,100 people at the agency are set to be placed on leave from Friday.\n\nEfforts by Doge to slash federal spending and radically restructure - or simply abolish - many government agencies have been overseen by tech billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nGiuffre alleged she was trafficked to the Duke of York when she was 17, which he has strenuously denied.\n\nGhayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump moves to close down Voice of America\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed an order to strip back federally funded news organisation Voice of America, accusing it of being \"anti-Trump\" and \"radical\".\n\nA White House statement said the order would \"ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda\", and included quotes from politicians and right-wing media criticising the broadcaster.\n\nVOA, still primarily a radio service, was set up during World War Two to counter Nazi propaganda. It says it currently reaches hundreds of millions of people globally each week.\n\nMike Abramowitz, VOA's director, said he and virtually his entire staff of 1,300 people had been put on paid leave.\n\nAbramowitz said that the order left VOA unable to carry out its \"vital mission... especially critical today, when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States\".\n\nThe National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order \"undermines America's long-standing commitment to a free and independent press\".\n\nIt added: \"If an entire newsroom can be sidelined overnight, what does that say about the state of press freedom?\n\n\"An entire institution is being dismantled piece by piece. This isn't just a staffing decision - it's a fundamental shift that endangers the future of independent journalism at VOA.\"\n\nThe president's order targets VOA's parent company US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which also funds non-profit entities such as Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia, which were originally set up to counter communism.\n\nIt tells managers to \"reduce performance... to the minimum presence and function required by law\".\n\nCBS, the BBC's US news partner, said that VOA employees were notified in an email by Crystal Thomas, the USAGM human resources director.\n\nA source told CBS that all freelance workers and international contractors were told there was now no money to pay them.\n\nEmails obtained by CBS notified the bosses of Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that their federal grants had been terminated.\n\nVOA and other stations under USAGM say they serve more than 400 million listeners. They are broadly equivalent to the BBC World Service, which is part-funded by the British government.\n\nThe Czech Republic's Foreign Minister, Jan Lipavský, said he hoped the European Union could help keep Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty running in Prague.\n\nHe said he would ask European foreign ministers at a meeting on Monday to find ways to at least partially maintain the broadcaster's operations.\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire and top adviser to Trump who has been overseeing sweeping cuts to the US government, has used his social media platform X to call for VOA to be shut down.\n\nThe US president also cut funding to several other federal agencies - including those responsible for preventing homelessness, and funding museums and libraries.\n\nTrump was highly critical of VOA in his first term. He has recently appointed staunch loyalist Kari Lake to be a special adviser for the USAGM.\n\nThe president regularly states that mainstream media outlets are biased against him. He called CNN and MSNBC \"corrupt\" during a speech at the justice department.\n\nVoice of America launched in 1942 with a mandate to combat Nazi and Japanese propaganda. Its first broadcast - made on a transmitter loaned to the US by the BBC - stated a modest purpose.\n\nGerald Ford, a former president, signed VOA's public charter in 1976 to safeguard its editorial independence.\n\nBy 1994, the Broadcast Board of Governors, with oversight over non-military broadcasting, was established.\n\nIn 2013, a shift in legislation allowed VOA and affiliates to begin broadcasting in the US.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nGiuffre alleged she was trafficked to the Duke of York when she was 17, which he has strenuously denied.\n\nGhayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

We do need as much as aid as possible.\"\n\nBy Nick Eardley\n\nEarlier, US Vice-President JD Vance said the US needed \"payback\" for it's support of Ukraine, claiming that European nations were getting repaid for their contributions .\n\nItâs true to say the United States has been a significant contributor to the Ukraine war effort â itâs support is by far the largest of any single country.\n\nIf you take military spending alone, the US has spent almost as much as every other country combined.\n\nIt is also right to say that some of what the EU contributes has been in the form of loans.\n\nBut thatâs true of most donors, including the United States.\n\nThe EU has also provided some grants, which wonât be repaid.\n\nThe EU  has published a breakdown of its own. It says around 65% of contributions from EU countries have been grants or what it calls âin kind supportâ, with the rest being loans on generous term.\n\nPresident Zelensky says he's asked Ukrainian officials to\ncontact their US counterparts to obtain official information on the suspension\nof military aid.\n\n\"I have instructed the defence minister, our intelligence chiefs\nand diplomats to contact their counterparts in the United States and get\nofficial information,\" he says in his nightly address.\n\n\"People should not be left to guess.\"\n\nHe says maintaining a \"normal, partnership relationship with America is crucial for truly ending the war.\nNone of us wants an endless war.\"\n\nPolly Bayfield BBC Newsbeat\n\nOn the front line in Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian soldier Dmytro says heâs not optimistic about returning to his normal life soon.\n\nâIt does not look like the war will end any time soon,â he tells BBC Newsbeat from his truck.\n\nThe 29-year-old covers his face during our call and predicts fighting will be âcomplicatedâ within a few weeks.\n\nâI donât think it will be pretty,â he says. âThere is no doubt American weapons have given us a fighting chance.â\n\nPresident Trump said in a press conference he wanted one thing to happen â for young people like Dmytro to âstop being killed by the thousandsâ in this war.\n\nâItâs real cheap to claim the worst thing about this war is the killing of young people,â Dmytro tells me.\n\nâThe real tragedyâ¦ is the history of Russian aggression.\n\nâThe killing should be stopped but it should never have begun in the first place.\n\nTom Bateman North America correspondent\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyâs statement is a response to the arm-twisting by Donald Trump and is clearly an attempt to try to get this relationship back on track after the utter disaster of the last four days - culminating in the suspension of US military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nThat move by the US is seeing arms shipments being held in Poland and will over time have a significant impact on Ukraineâs ability to defend itself.\n\nThe key question now is whether Zelenskyâs statement will be enough. What Trump wants him to do is two things; first sign the minerals deal, then sign up to a quick ceasefire without a US security guarantee.\n\nZelensky seems to be suggesting heâs prepared to go down that road â calling the deal a âstepâ towards a security guarantee, which he is still looking for.\n\nBut there is also an emotive element to all this. We saw Zelensky humiliated by the administration on Friday - where he was called ungrateful and disrespectful - and weâve seen the disparaging comments amplified since then.\n\nThere is a view among critics in Washington that the administration wants to see Zelensky grovel in order to restore a relationship with the White House and to get the military assistance back.\n\nWeâll get a clearer sense tonight whether Zelenskyâs done enough when Trump makes his joint address to Congress.\n\nNo 10 says Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's \"steadfast commitment to securing peace\" following his statement on X.\n\n\"Underscoring that any peace for Ukraine needed to be lasting and secure, the prime minister said no one wanted peace more than Ukraine,\" a No 10 spokeswoman writes.\n\nAs Zelensky issued his statement - summarised in one of our previous posts - US Vice-President JD Vance spoke to reporters about the war in Ukraine and the US decision to pause military aid.\n\nHe says the US needs to \"get some payback for the incredible financial investment\" it has made in Ukraine, adding that European nations are getting repaid for their support.\n\n\"Well, it's really ridiculous, and frankly, an insult to the American people, that the Europeans are getting a better deal than the American people,\" Vance says.\n\nAsked if the US might resume providing Ukraine with military aid, Vance says that when Kyiv begins negotiating \"everything is on the table\".\n\nHe says to move forward, they need Ukraine to come and tell them what they need privately: \"That is the most important thing, and that lack of private engagement is what is most concerning to us.\"\n\nDanny Aeberhard Europe analyst, BBC World Service\n\nOn Friday, at their fractious White House meeting, Donald Trump said President Zelensky did not \"have the cards\".\n\nThat reality appears to have hit home, hours after Washington suspended all military aid.\n\nZelensky expressed a willingness to consider a partial truce - in the air, and at sea - if Moscow did likewise.\n\nHe also expressed regret for the way the White House meeting had gone. That's despite many observers believing he was the victim of a political trap.\n\nHe again thanked America, naming Trump specifically, for previous aid, and said he was prepared to sign a deal with the US on accessing Ukrainian minerals.\n\nUkraine has resisted three years of full-scale invasion by its enemy, Russia.\n\nBut it's the actions of an ally that's left its underbelly exposed - the radical pivot of US foreign policy by President Trump.\n\nNow we've had time to digest that statement from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, here's a summary:\n\nPresident Zelensky uses the final lines of his statement to reiterate Ukraine's gratitude for previous US support.\n\n\"We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,\" he writes on X.\n\n\"And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins. We are grateful for this,\" the president says.\n\nHe also says Ukraine is \"ready\" to sign the US-proposed minerals deal.\n\nIf you're just joining us, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has shared a statement after the US announced it would pause military aid to Ukraine. Scroll back through our previous two posts for more on this.\n\nIn a post on X, Zelensky says the first stages in ending the war could include \"the release of prisoners and truce in the sky â ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure â and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same\".\n\n\"Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal.\"\n\nWe're still combing through the statement - stay with us further updates.\n\nAs we just reported, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has released a statement on X. We can bring you more on that now.\n\nHe reiterates Ukraine's \"commitment to peace\", adding: \"None of us wants an endless war.\"\n\n\"Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer,\" he continues.\n\n\"Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trumpâs strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,\" the president adds.\n\n\"We are ready to work fast to end the war.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed regret over his angry exchange with Donald Trump in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on\nFriday, did not go the way it was supposed to be,\" he writes in a post on X.\n\n\"It is regrettable that it\nhappened this way. It is time to make things right.\"\n\nMore on this shortly. For now, here's a look at how the meeting unfolded:\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nWatch: From laughter to anger, how the meeting spiralled\n\nBernd Debusmann Jr Reporting from the White House\n\nThings are abnormally quiet at the White House at the moment, with most reporters - and staff - only coming in slightly later, given that President Trump isn't speaking at Capitol Hill until about 19:10 EST (00:10 GMT).\n\nThere's nothing else on his public schedule so far today, and he's been notably silent about Ukraine on social media - although he's been posting about other matters.\n\nWe do know, however, that Ukraine is going to be one of the focuses of his speech to Congress tonight.\n\nAmong the major themes - first reported by Fox - is what the White House has termed has described as Trump's plans for peace around the world, including Ukraine.\n\nA White House official told Fox the speech will outline his plan to end the fighting there.\n\nTrump's deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, told CNN that he believes Trump \"is using a two by four to go and get his point across\" to Zelensky.\n\n\"That is that President Trump wants to stop the killing,\" he added. \"Zelensky has got to  get back to the table. He has to take this seriously. No more goofing off.\"\n\nThe BBC has contacted the White House for further details.\n\nStay with us for more updates.\n\nThe UK's Chancellor Rachel Reeves says the US is the closest partner with the UK on defence and security - and that will continue to be the case\n\nSpeaking at a conference, she also says there is a \"recognition across Europe that we must step up\" to secure the \"collective defence\" of the continent.\n\nReeves adds that she wants to speed up the delivery and procurement of defence equipment..\n\nShe says things have been \"much quicker\" when procuring for Ukraine, but they need to make this the norm for the Ministry of Defence (MoD).\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nRachel Reeves: US will 'continue to be' UK's closest defence partner\n\nA Ukrainian opposition MP says rebuilding transatlantic unity and re-establishing communication between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky should be a \"top priority\" following the US move to halt aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"[The situation] is more than just between Trump and Zelensky. It's about freedom, it's about two nations,\" Mariia Ionova tells the BBC. \"There is still a chance that we can do a lot of things together.\"\n\nShe says Ukraine and European allies should \"build a common position\" on ending the war.\n\n\"The decision to pause military support is just a signal that Trump would like us to capitulate. The suspension of the military aid is a matter of concern,\" she adds.\n\nNews of the US decision to pause military aid for Ukraine was communicated to us overnight by a White House official.\n\nSince, we've heard reaction from world leaders, politicians and experts, as well as Ukrainian civilians and soldiers on the frontline.\n\nThere are some notable absences, however.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is yet to comment. He's up and active on his Truth Social platform, but silent on Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky shared details of his call with Germany's incoming chancellor, Friedrich Merz. But, again, no mention of the suspended aid.\n\nOver in Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg that the pause was likely to be the \"best\" contribution to peace - but no word from President Putin .\n\nBen Barry, a senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, has been speaking to our colleagues on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme about the possible impact on Ukraine of the pause in military aid.\n\nHe believes Ukraine will feel the loss of US intelligence as well as hardware.\n\n\"Intelligence has been a key part of US, UK, and western\nsupport to Ukraine - but the US is the worldâs intelligence superpower, and\nneither the British nor the rest of Europe could quickly fill the gap from the\nvast US intelligence assets,\" he says.\n\n\"I think, in terms of military capability, the\nthing that will worry Ukraine most is the non-supply of Patriot missiles,\nwhich have this unique capability to intercept incoming ballistic missiles and\nhave more capability in this, than anything that Europeâs got.\"\n\nThe other two capabilities\nare long-range artillery and the short-range ballistic missiles which again, Europe doesnât supply, he says.\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.

      "text": "What does the US education department do - and can Trump truly dismantle it?\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aiming to begin the dismantling of the Department of Education.\n\nIt's a long-held goal of conservatives but the complete shuttering of the department is unlikely as it would take an act of Congress.\n\nSince Trump returned to the White House, the department has already announced plans to slash about half of its workforce.\n\nEstablished in 1979, the department oversees funding for public schools, administers student loans and runs programmes that help low-income students.\n\nTrump and his allies have accused the agency of indoctrinating young people with racial, sexual and political material.\n\nA common misconception is that the Department of Education operates US schools and sets curricula - that responsibility actually belongs to states and local districts.\n\nThe agency does oversee student loan programmes and administers Pell grants that help low-income students attend university.\n\nIt also helps fund programmes to support students with disabilities and for students living in poverty.\n\nAnd the department enforces civil rights law designed to prevent race or sex-based discrimination in federally funded schools.\n\nThe department's allocation was $238bn (£188bn) in fiscal year 2024 - less than 2% of the total federal budget.\n\nThe agency has about 4,400 employees, the smallest of any cabinet-level department. The Trump administration has sought to cut that and the department announced plans to slash about half of its workforce .\n\nMost public funding for US schools comes from state and local governments.\n\nIn 2024, the Education Data Initiative estimated that the US spends a total of just over $857bn on primary and secondary education - the equivalent of $17,280 per pupil.\n\nOn his own, no.\n\nNot only would Trump need congressional approval to get rid of the department, but he would also probably need a supermajority in the US Senate - 60 out of 100 senators.\n\nRepublicans have a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so they would need at least seven Democrats to vote to abolish the agency - a political longshot.\n\nEven in the House of Representatives, Trump might struggle to gain necessary support.\n\nA vote last year to abolish the education department - which was attached as an amendment to another bill - failed to pass as 60 Republicans joined all Democrats in the House to vote no.\n\nBut Trump is still moving ahead with his plan to shut the department.\n\nHis executive order directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure\" of the agency and transfer authority to state and local governments.\n\nIt also instructs her to ensure \"the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely\".\n\nIt does not include a timeline or deadline for the move, which is expected to face legal challenges.\n\nTrump has moved to shrink other government departments in recent weeks, despite questions about the legality of those moves.\n\nEducation department employees are among those who are the focus of the administration's efforts to shrink the federal workforce .\n\nTrump previously promised that part of his dismantling of the education department would include rehousing certain programmes, such as student loans, in different government agencies.\n\nOn Friday, he announced the student loans portfolio would be moved from the education department to the small business administration \"immediately\".\n\nThat portfolio includes more than $1.5tn (£1.1tn) in loans taken out by more than 40 million Americans.\n\nThe text of the executive order shutting the education department down compares the debt portfolio managed by the department to the size of the Wells Fargo bank.\n\n\"The Department of Education is not a bank, and it must return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America's students,\" the executive order states.\n\nRegardless of which agency manages student loans, borrowers will still have to pay them back.\n\nCourt rulings and Trump's policies have reversed some changes that former President Joe Biden attempted to make to lower borrowing costs and forgive some debts.\n\nThe idea of eliminating the education department has been floated by Republicans for nearly as long as it has existed.\n\nDuring Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign, he pushed for it to be dismantled.\n\nRepublicans have historically pushed against centralising education policy, believing that it is best left up to individual states and localities.\n\nMore recently they have accused the education department of pushing what they describe as \"woke\" political ideology on to children, including on gender and race.\n\nTrump's allies also want to expand school choice, which would allow students and families to use public money to select private or religious alternatives to public schools.\n\nConservatives argue that education department functions should be handled by other agencies, for instance that civil rights infractions are the Department of Justice's domain.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nGiuffre alleged she was trafficked to the Duke of York when she was 17, which he has strenuously denied.\n\nGhayda and her husband Ahmad say they could never discuss politics in Syria - now, they will vote in Canada's election.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump says anti-Tesla protesters will face 'hell'\n\nPeople protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday at a White House media event designed to bolster Elon Musk's electric car company.\n\nTrump sat in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy, with Musk in the passenger seat, but did not test drive it.\n\nDemonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration.\n\nTrump said they were \"harming a great American company\", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would \"go through hell\".\n\nThe president described the shiny red Model-S, one of a number of Teslas lined up on the White House drive, as \"beautiful\" but said he was no longer allowed to drive and so would keep the car for the use of White House staff. Current and former presidents are not allowed to drive for security reasons.\n\nHe also said he would not want to buy a self-driving model, which Musk said would reach the market next year.\n\nThe showcase for Tesla's cars outside the White House came after Tesla's market value halved since its all-time peak in December, sliding 15% in a single day on Monday, before recovering slightly on Tuesday.\n\nTrump said he had told Musk, \"You know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company.\"\n\nMusk, Trump's top donor in the election campaign, has been tasked with radically cutting government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).\n\nHe has instigated sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, cancelled international aid programmes, and has voiced support for far-right politics.\n\nThat has prompted a backlash among Tesla owners.\n\n\"Tesla takedown\" protests have seen demonstrators gather outside dealerships, in Portland, Oregon, last week, and New York City earlier in March, with the aim of undermining the Tesla brand.\n\nOrganisers behind the protests said on social media that the demonstrations were peaceful, but a few have been destructive with fires intentionally set at Tesla showrooms and charging stations in Colorado and Massachusetts last week.\n\nAsked in front of the White House whether such protesters should be labelled \"domestic terrorists\", the president said \"I will do that\", a position later confirmed by a White House spokesperson.\n\n\"You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell,\" Trump said.\n\nOn his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump blamed Tesla's share price falls on \"radical left lunatics\", who he said were trying to \"illegally and collusively boycott\" the firm.\n\nHowever, stock analysts said the main reason for the poor performance of the shares was fear about Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.\n\nUBS warned that new Tesla deliveries could be much lower than expected this year.\n\nLindsay James, an investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said that although there was \"an element\" of Elon Musk's politics having a \"brand impact\", there were other reasons for the share price fall.\n\nUltimately the drop came down to \"hard numbers\", she said.\n\n\"When we look at new orders, for example in Europe and China, you can see that they've effectively halved over the last year,\" she said.\n\nSales in Europe have fallen sharply this year. Across the continent, they were down 45% in January compared to the same month in 2024, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA).\n\nThere has also been a steep decline in China - a key market - and Australia.\n\nSome experts have said Tesla is over-valued, so the fall is seen as a correction, while others have pointed to rising competition from some of China's electric vehicle companies.\n\nInvestors are \"certainly getting more worried about an economic slowdown too, so the richest-valued companies like Tesla have been hit hardest in recent days\", Ms James said.\n\nThere have also been concerns that Musk has not been focusing enough of his attention on his firms.\n\nIn an interview with Fox Business on Monday, he said he was combining the Doge role with running his businesses \"with great difficulty\".\n\nAlongside Tesla, his businesses include Space X, which has experienced serious failures in the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket, and the social media network X, which suffered an outage on Monday .\n\nDespite his supportive comments, President Trump's policies so far have been designed to limit electric car sales in the US, including revoking a 2021 order by former president Joe Biden that half of all car sales should be electric by 2030, and halting unspent government funds for charging stations.\n\nTrump's tariffs could also hurt the manufacturer. Tesla chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja said in January that Tesla parts sourced from Canada and Mexico would be subject to the levies and that this could hit profitability.\n\nTesla's share price fall came against a broader US market slump on Monday as investors, concerned about the economic effects of Trump's tariffs and weakening confidence in the economy, sold shares.\n\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the biggest developments in global technology, with analysis from BBC correspondents around the world.\n\nOutside the UK? Sign up here.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThousands have gathered in Rome to pay their respects to the late pontiff.\n\nThere may be opportunities for impromptu diplomacy at one of the largest gatherings of world leaders in years.\n\nThe US president's envoy meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow, while Ukraine calls for more pressure on Russia.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

See you over there.\n\nMyroslava Petsa BBC News Ukrainian, in Washington\n\nThe Ukrainian delegation here in Washington has gone quiet.\n\nA planned appearance by President Zelensky at a think tank earlier this evening was cancelled at the last minute â after the buffet had already been served.\n\nUkrainian officials are still trying to process what happened today.\n\nBut thereâs no doubt in government circles that this trip has gone terribly wrong.\n\nA day that was meant to bring about a new chapter in US-Ukraine relations has ended with the two sides in uncharted territory.\n\nUS support has proven critical for Ukraineâs survival â President Zelensky said as much on Fox News this evening.\n\nHe heads to London on Saturday to meet UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer, an important ally.\n\nBut Kyiv will be thinking hard about how to salvage damaged relations with their most important partner - the United States.\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nA photo of Ukraine's ambassador with her head in her hands during the heated exchange in the Oval Office has gone viral with nearly two million views on X.\n\nOksana Markarova was in the Oval Office sitting near the leaders and cameras caught her reaction to the spat.\n\nDemocrats are unified in their party's support of Ukraine\n\nAnd now we bring you some more reactions from Democrats in Congress who seem to be aligned in how they view the Oval Office meeting - that Trump and Vance attacked Zelensky to help or to impress Putin.\n\nHere are some notable comments from top Democratic lawmakers:\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer, Democrats' leader in the chamber , on X: \"Trump and Vance are doing Putinâs dirty work.\n\nSenate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy.\"\n\nRepresentative Hakeem Jefffies, the highest-ranking Democrat in the House: \"Todayâs White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator. The United States must not reward Russian aggression and continue to appease Putin.\"\n\nSenator Jeanne Shaheen, the most senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, to a reporter: \"It's distressing to see the President... is walking away from our commitment in Ukraine, and doesn't seem to understand what a murderous dictator Vladimir Putin is.\"\n\nRepresentative Gregory Meeks, the most senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee: \"Trumpâs actions today undermined U.S. leadership, emboldened our adversaries, humiliated both himself and his Republican Party, and insulted the generations of Americans who fought and died to build Americaâs standing in the world. It is not President Zelensky who disrespected the United States in the Oval Office. It was Donald Trump.â\n\nSenator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran : \"Attacking our democratic partner in service of an autocratic dictator. \n\nTrump is a national disgrace.\"\n\nRepresentative Ted Lieu, a long-serving member of the House who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee: \"Nobody is celebrating President Trump and Vice President Vanceâs embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office more than Vladimir Putin. Today was a distressing moment for those of us who value democracy and Americaâs role as a force for good.\"\n\nSenator Chris Murphy, a more liberal Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has emerged as one of Trump's fiercest critics, on X: \"What just happened in the Oval Office was a planned ambush, designed to help a brutal Russian dictator and hurt America's security. \n\nTrump has become Putin's lapdog, and America's global power is hemorrhaging as America sides with dictators over democracy. What an embarrassment.\"\n\nMike Wendling US digital reporter\n\nBrian Glenn, pictured with girlfriend Marjorie Taylor Greene, asked about the Ukrainian leader's wardrobe\n\nJust before the heated exchange in the Oval Office, Zelensky faced questioning and comments over his choice to wear combat gear from a conservative journalist. The wardrobe question presaged the argument about thankfulness and respect.\n\n\"Why don't\nyou wear a suit? Do you own a suit? A lot of Americans have a problem with you\nnot respecting the dignity of the office,\" the reporter asked.\n\nZelensky has made a habit of wearing sweatshirts, usually\nadorned with the Ukrainian trident symbol, even when at important meetings with\nworld leaders. He seemed unperturbed by the question.\n\n\"I will wear (a) costume after this war will finish,â\nhe told the reporter. âMaybe something like yours, maybe something betterâ¦\nMaybe something cheaper.\"\n\nThe question was posed by Brian Glenn, the Chief White House\nCorrespondent for Real Americaâs Voice, a right-wing network with a show line-up\nchock-full of Trump allies.\n\nItâs unclear how salty the Ukrainian president meant to be in\nhis answer - the word âsuitâ can be translated into Ukrainian as âkostyumâ - and\nthe news conference swiftly moved on.\n\nBut the issue of due respect was at the centre of the full-fledged\nargument that burst out in the Oval Office just minutes later.\n\nDemocrat Madeleine Dean on a visit to Kyiv in April 2024\n\nWe will continue to bring you more reactions from Ukraine and other parts of the world on today's White House spat, but for now let's stay in Washington DC where Trumpâs Democratic opponents have blasted his approach.\n\nMadeleine Dean, a US House representative from Pennsylvania, is calling on Trump and Vance to\napologise for their âdisgraceful behaviourâ, describing it as âso un-American.â\n\nDean tells BBC Radio 4âs The World Tonight: âThey acted like two 7th grade\nbulliesâ and accused JD Vance of having âegged onâ the argument,\nwith President Trump going forward with it âin grotesque ways, so much of it\nnot based in the truthâ.\n\nâWhat I have heard from Mr Zelensky, from everyone who works with him, from\nthe generals on the ground and the ordinary foot soldier is thank you, thank\nyou, thank you, thank you, we depend upon you,\" says Dean, who visited Ukraine last year.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called  it a \"shameful display\".\n\nâIt wouldâve been a show of strength for the President of the United States to bring the elected leader of Ukraine to the Oval Office and engage with him in a dignified way,â Pelosi posted on X. âBut you would never know that after President Trumpâs shameful display. Putin must be overjoyed with todayâs theatrics.\"\n\nLooking for more analysis on the tensions in the White House today?\n\nBBC Newscast is dissecting Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky's extraordinary clash in the Oval Office.\n\nYou can listen on BBC Sounds, or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nWe are getting some reactions from Ukraine to the extraordinary exchange between Trump and Zelensky today.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC's World Tonight, an MP for an opposition party in Ukraine defended Zelensky, saying he was being âattackedâ by Trump and Vance at the White House today.\n\nMP Inna Sovsun told Radio 4 that Zelensky âcouldnât have predicted that level of aggressionâ.\n\nâI do believe the President was speaking on behalf of all Ukrainian people,\" she said.\n\n\"I think that itâs unacceptable, what he faced there,\" she added.\n\nPresident Zelensky's interview on Fox News - his first since the fiery spat in the White House earlier today - has just concluded.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Bret Baier asks Zelensky if the relationship between him and Trump could be salvaged.\n\n\"Yes of course,\" Zelensky replies. \"Because the relations are more than just two presidents.\"\n\nHe notes it is also about \"historical relations\" between the two countries, as well as \"strong relations between our two people.\"\n\n\"That is why I began to thank your people from our people,\" Zelensky says. \"Your people helped to save our people.\"\n\nThe interview ends with Zelensky saying: \"We are thankful, and sorry for this,\" adding that Ukraine only wants to have strong relations with the US.\n\nBaier asks Zelensky if he thinks Trump is growing too close to Putin.\n\nZelensky says Trump told him today that he wants to be in the middle with both sides at the negotiating table.\n\nBut Ukraine wants Trump to be \"more on our side\" than in the middle of negotiations.\n\n\"Russia brought this war to our country, and they are not right,\" he says. \"They didn't respect our territorial integrity.\"\n\nZelensky says he does not know whether the confrontation with Trump and  Vance was a planned ambush, as some Democrats have suggested. âIt was just a really tough situation,â he says.\n\n\"I want to be very polite,\" he insists, but says that some politicians have\ngiven inaccurate information on deaths in Ukraine and the state of his country. And when those kinds of things were brought up today, \"it was not good.â\n\nBret Baier asks Zelensky if Ukraine could hold off Russia without continued US support.\n\n\"It would be difficult for us. That is why I am here,\" he responds.\n\nBut he adds that Ukraine cannot lose its freedom.\n\n\"Russians came to our territory, to our houses ... they killed so many people,\" Zelensky says. \"Just to forget it, just to say Putin is a great guy, no.\"\n\nZelensky says he is open for diplomacy with Russia when there are security guarantees for Ukraine's future from the US.\n\n\"We'll be ready,\" he says.\n\nOn Fox News, Bret Baier shows Zelensky a clip of Trump speaking to reporters hours after the meeting, telling them that Zelensky just wants to \"fight, fight, fight\".\n\nZelensky says he disagrees. Ukrainians are \"ready for peace\", he says, adding that's why he came to the White House for the visit, but he adds that the country needs \"security guarantees\".\n\n\"I can't just say stop,\" he says. \"We want just and lasting peace.\"\n\nZelensky is asked whether todayâs events were good for his\ncountry, and he replies by saying: âThis is so sensitive.â\n\nâJust a ceasefire without security guarantees, this is\nsensitive for our people,â he continues, and says that he and other Ukrainians\nâjust want to hear that America is on our side and will stay with us and not\nwith Russia\".\n\nThe Ukrainian president says heâll continue to give his point\nof view.\n\nâThis kind of spat is not good for both sides,â he says. âI\nam very open, but I canât change our Ukranian attitude towards Russia. They are\nkillers.â\n\nPresident Zelensky tells Fox News that Ukrainians and Americans \"have to be on the same side\" against Russia.\n\n\"I hope that the president is on our side together with us,\" he says, adding it is \"very important to stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin\".\n\nZelensky asserts that Putin has broken ceasefire agreements with Ukraine numerous times,.\n\nAsked if he owes Donald Trump an apology after what unfolded today in the Oval Office, Zelensky does not directly answer the question.\n\n\"I respect the president and I respect American people,\" he says.\n\nBut he adds: \"I think we have to be very open and very honest, and I am not sure that we did something bad.\"\n\nAfter abruptly leaving the White House following a tense confrontation with President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is now being interviewed by Bret Baier on Fox News..\n\nBaier starts by asking him if he owes Trump an apology for the testy exchange today, and Zelensky says he is very thankful for Americans' support, for the president's and lawmakers' support.\n\nZelensky says that nobody wants to finish the war more than Ukrainians.\n\nWe just heard from US President Donald Trump as he left the White House .\n\nAnd now we are expecting to hear from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky is set to be interviewed on US network Fox News at 18:00 ET (23:00 GMT).\n\nWe are listening in and will share the top lines from that interview as it happens.\n\nWriting on X, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says that \"Russia illegally and unjustifiably invaded Ukraine\".\n\nHe adds: \"Canada will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace.\" Zelensky has replied to the tweet with: \"thank you for your support\".\n\nForeign Minister Melanie Joly adds that she has been in touch with her Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, and has reaffirmed \"Canada's unwavering support for Ukraine\".\n\nSince Trump's return to the White House, Canada's relationship with Washington has been strained.\n\nTrump is threatening to slap 25% tariffs on imports from both Canada and Mexico next Tuesday in response to what he calls an \"unacceptable\" level of drugs coming into the US. The US president backed down on a previous threat to impose the tariffs earlier this month.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's administration have made repeated remarks about annexing the US' northern neighbour, with the president referring to the Canada's prime minister as \"Governor Trudeau\" and Canada as the \"51st state\" on multiple occasions.\n\nCanada has the world's second-largest Ukrainian diaspora, following only Russia.\n\nVitaliy Shevchenko Russia editor, BBC Monitoring\n\nNow for the latest on the ground in Ukraine, with explosions reported in the country's second-largest city,\nKharkiv.\n\nMayor Ihor Terekhov says residential areas in the city centre have\nbeen targeted, and a hospital is on fire.\n\nRegional administration head Oleh Synehubov adds that Russian\ndrones are targeting central parts of the city.\n\nBoth say the number of casualties is being clarified.\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Who is on Trump's top team?\n\nThe new team entrusted with delivering Donald Trump's agenda is in place, featuring several contentious picks.\n\nAhead of his return to the White House on 20 January 2025, he appointed Fox News host and military veteran Pete Hegseth as defence secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr as health secretary-both confirmed by the Senate.\n\nMarco Rubio is the secretary of state, while billionaire supporter Elon Musk is advising on mass layoffs, contract terminations, and a drastic federal government downsizing.\n\nHere's a closer look at his top officials:\n\nSecretary of state - Marco Rubio\n\nFlorida Senator Rubio, 53, was confirmed as US secretary of state just hours after Trump was sworn into office.\n\nHe is now serving as the top US diplomat when representing the country overseas, and also the president's main adviser on foreign affairs.\n\nRubio, who is the first Latino person to hold the post in US history, takes a hawkish view of China. He opposed Trump in the 2016 Republican primary but has since mended fences.\n\nDefence secretary - Pete Hegseth\n\nHegseth, a military veteran and Fox News host with no prior political experience,  was confirmed as defence secretary less than a week after Trump's inauguration.\n\nHis appointment was highly anticipated amid ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza. \"Nobody fights harder for the troops,\" Trump said of Hegseth.\n\nAfter Hegseth's nomination it emerged that he was investigated in 2017 for an alleged sexual assault. He was never arrested or charged and denies the allegation.\n\nHis lawyer confirmed he paid a woman that year to stay silent about a separate assault claim he feared could cost him his Fox job-an accusation he also denies.\n\nAttorney general - Pam Bondi\n\nTrump's first pick for attorney general, former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, withdrew after a week of controversy over a congressional investigation into sexual misconduct and drug allegations against him, which he denied.\n\nSix hours later, Trump named former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his replacement. \"Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, tough on violent criminals, and made Florida's streets safe,\" he wrote.\n\nBondi previously served on Trump's Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission and was part of his defence team during his first impeachment trial.\n\nDepartment of the interior - Doug Burgum\n\nBurgum, the former governor of North Dakota, leads the Department of the Interior, which is responsible for the management and conservation of federal lands and natural resources.\n\nA software entrepreneur who sold his small company to Microsoft in 2001, Burgum briefly ran in the 2024 Republican primary before dropping out, endorsing Trump and quickly impressing him with his low-drama persona and sizeable wealth.\n\nHealth and human services - Robert F Kennedy Jr\n\nRFK Jr, as he is known, is an environmental lawyer, vaccine sceptic and the nephew of former President John F Kennedy. He recently added leading the Department of Health and Human Services to his resume.\n\nDespite having no medical qualifications, Kennedy, 70, now has broad remit over US federal health agencies - including those that oversee approval of vaccines and pharmaceuticals.\n\nKennedy has endorsed a number of health claims that are not backed by scientific evidence, including many on vaccines, which have concerned many medical experts.\n\nFood and Drug Administration - Dr Marty Makary\n\nTrump has nominated Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, the organisation responsible for the safety of prescription drugs and vaccines .\n\nTrump announced in his nomination that Dr Makary would be ideal to \"course-correct and refocus the Agency\".\n\nThe Johns Hopkins University professor is an author, surgeon and trained cancer specialist. He spoke to conservative media outlets during the Covid-19 pandemic, questioning the need for masks and expressing concerns over the Covid vaccine among young children, which research showed helped prevent severe illness.\n\nVeterans' affairs - Doug Collins\n\nFormer Georgia congressman Doug Collins leads the US Department of Veterans' Affairs.\n\nCollins was a Trump loyalist when he served in Congress from 2013-21 and an outspoken advocate for the president during both impeachment hearings.\n\nAn Iraq war veteran who now serves as a chaplain in the US Air Force Reserve, Collins left Congress for an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in his home state of Georgia.\n\nHomeland security - Kristi Noem\n\nFormer South Dakota Governor Noem is in a key role in the administration, overseeing US security, including its borders, cyber-threats, terrorism and emergency response.\n\nThe agency has a $62bn (£48bn) budget and employs thousands of people. It incorporates a wide variety of agencies under its umbrella, ranging from Customs and Border Protection to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTransportation secretary - Sean Duffy\n\nThe former congressman and Fox Business host leads the Department of Transportation.\n\nHe is in charge of aviation, automotive, rail, transit and other transportation policies at a department with an annual budget of roughly $110bn.\n\nIn the role, the secretary can expect to face a number of safety-related aviation issues, including a series of deadly plane crashes in the US in the early months of 2025.\n\nEnergy secretary - Chris Wright\n\nOil and gas industry executive Wright leads the Department of Energy, where he is expected to fulfil Trump's campaign promise to \"drill, baby, drill\" and maximise US energy production.\n\nWright, the founder-CEO of Liberty Energy, has called climate activists alarmist and likened Democrats' push for renewables to Soviet-style communism.\n\nIn a video posted to his LinkedIn profile last year, he said: \"There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either.\"\n\nCommerce secretary - Howard Lutnick\n\nLutnick was the co-chair of Trump's transition team.\n\nTrump said Lutnick, as a member of the cabinet, would spearhead the administration's \"tariff and trade agenda\".\n\nThe billionaire and former CEO of the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald is overseeing 50,000 employees tasked with growing the economy and creating jobs, among other goals.\n\nEducation secretary - Linda McMahon\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) co-founder and Trump transition co-chair, McMahon, was picked for education secretary.\n\nA long-time Trump ally, McMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first presidency and donated millions of dollars to his presidential campaign.\n\nTrump has promised to shut down the education department - a job McMahon could be tasked with if she wins Senate confirmation.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly support and agree with this mission,\" she said during her confirmation hearing.\n\nTreasury secretary - Scott Bessent\n\nScott Bessent leads the Treasury Department, a post with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions.\n\nA Wall Street financier who once worked for liberal billionaire George Soros, Bessent was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and brings a relatively conventional resume to the role.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bessent told voters that Trump would usher in a \"new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes\".\n\n\"[He] has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda,\" Trump said about his pick.\n\nLabour secretary - Lori Chavez-DeRemer\n\nChavez-DeRemer has been selected by Trump to lead the US Department of Labor - which oversees worker health and safety and workforce laws and administers unemployment and workers compensation.\n\nChavez-DeRemer had been serving in the US Congress since 2023 but lost her re-election bid in Oregon in the November election, despite winning strong trade union support.\n\nHousing secretary - Scott Turner\n\nTurner, an NFL veteran and motivational speaker, leads the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud), which aims to address the country's housing needs.\n\nTypically, Hud enforces laws, prevents discrimination and provides assistance to those in need, through both low-income housing and helping Americans avoid foreclosure.\n\nTurner served as the executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump's first term.\n\nAgriculture secretary - Brooke Rollins\n\nRollins grew up on a farm, but her most recent job was as co-founder and head of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank to promote Trump's public policy agenda.\n\nRollins graduated from the Texas A&M University with a degree in agriculture development and later obtained her law degree from the same university.\n\nAs agriculture secretary, she oversees farm subsidies, federal nutrition programmes, meat inspections and other facets of the country's agricultural industry.\n\nOutside the 15 department heads who make up the core of the cabinet, there are several other roles that are often given cabinet-rank, like the FBI director and the head of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). Some of them require Senate approval, but others do not.\n\nHere are some of the important names:\n\nDepartment of Government Efficiency - Elon Musk\n\nTrump tapped close ally and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk to lead what he has termed a Department of Government Efficiency.  It is not a cabinet-level department or agency approved by Congress, but it does include paid staff with access to various government agencies.\n\nKnown as Doge - a nod to a cryptocurrency promoted by Musk - it serves in an advisory capacity to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies\", Trump said.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, has proven to be one of Trump's most controversial picks as he has suggested massive cuts to the federal workforce and government funding.\n\nOther names to know:\n\nAged just 10 when his father first became president, he's now well over six feet tall, and goes to New York University.\n\nThe US president spoke about his plans for the second Trump administration, as well as criticising the 'corrupt establishment'.\n\nWatch the historic moment when the 45th president is returned to power as he takes the oath of office.\n\nElon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were among those invited inside the Capitol for Donald Trump's swearing in.\n\nThousands of people joined in on demonstrations as the United States prepares to inaugurate its new president.\n\nThe outgoing US president warned against power in the hands of the wealthy, the threat of the tech industry and climate change.\n\nTrump's pick for US attorney general was pressed on claims of election fraud and pardons for January 6 rioters.\n\nDonald Trump's defence secretary nominee was asked about his stance on women in combat and his alleged excessive drinking.\n\nHarris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution.\n\nAmong the allies the president-elect has chosen to join his administration are contentious figures, including among fellow Republicans.\n\nThe president-elect has nominated RFK to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe suspect used an \"improvised incendiary device\" to start the fire in Portland, Oregon, ahead of the US election.\n\nA week after losing the election, Kamala Harris's team are still appealing for funds.\n\nRepublicans have won control of both chambers of Congress, yielding Trump limited congressional oversight for at least 2 years.\n\nThe president and president-elect shook hands as part of a long-standing tradition signifying the transfer of power.\n\nGiven all the things they've said about each other, Joe Biden and Donald Trump's meeting could be really awkward.\n\n'I think Putin believes that he knows how to play Trump', says Trump's former adviser John Bolton.\n\nThe Russian president says he was impressed by Trump's reaction to the first assassination attempt against him.\n\nThe president addressed Americans from the White House for the first time since Donald Trump's election victory.\n\nAfter Donald Trump's decisive victory, we asked Americans what they think made the difference for each campaign.\n\nTasked with reducing government spending and cutting jobs, the agency has faced legal challenges.\n\nThe conspiracy theorist reportedly urged Trump to fire several National Security Council officials, a claim denied by the president.\n\nThe Vances met as students, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".\n\nIndian Americans are optimistic about India's future, but wary of US-India ties under a second Trump term.\n\nThe conservative from Ohio shot to fame writing about his hard upbringing and is now next in line to the US presidency.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump rescinds order targeting law firm after it makes $40m promise\n\nPresident Donald Trump has rescinded an executive order targeting a prestigious international law firm after it promised to abandon diversity policies and provide $40m (£31m) worth of free legal work to support White House initiatives.\n\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is a multinational law firm headquartered in New York that has many high-profile clients.\n\nTrump's 14 March order had terminated federal contracts with the firm and suspended security clearances for its lawyers, saying it was undermining the US judicial system.\n\nThe firm is now facing blowback from many in the legal community, including a top lawyer for Democrats, even as some lawyers said it had few other options.\n\nTrump has issued similar executive orders against the law firms Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling.\n\nThe White House rescinded the order on Thursday after a meeting between Trump and Brad Karp, the chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, the president said the firm had agreed to a series of concessions, including the promise to provide \"the equivalent of $40 million in pro bono legal services over the course of President Trump's term to support the Administration's initiatives\".\n\nIt added that Paul Weiss would commit to \"merit-based\" hiring and promotion, and \"will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies\".\n\nTrump's order last week had cancelled contracts with the firms citing Trump's orders to wipe out any initiatives aimed at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) within the federal government.\n\nThe Truth Social post also included a statement from Mr Karp, who said: \"We are gratified that the President has agreed to withdraw the Executive Order concerning Paul, Weiss. We look forward to an engaged and constructive relationship with the President and his Administration.\"\n\nMany in the legal community have expressed outrage over the deal, which one lawyer said was a \"sad day for the legal industry\".\n\nMarc Elias, a former Perkins Coie partner and a top lawyer for Democrats, assailed the agreement in a post on social media platform Bluesky.\n\n\"Paul Weiss, didn't just bend a knee, it set a new standard for shameful capitulation,\" he wrote. \"This is a stain on the firm, every one of its partners, and the entire legal profession.\"\n\nSoon after Trump made the announcement, Rachel Cohen, an associate at the Skadden Arps legal firm, resigned in a blistering company-wide email condemning the agreement.\n\n\"Please consider this email my two week notice, revocable if the firm comes up with a satisfactory response to the current moment,\" she wrote. Cohen had asked Skadden to sign onto a brief supporting another firm that has sued the Trump administration.\n\nShe had helped organise the open letter criticising the Trump administration for attempting to \"bully corporate law firms out of engaging in any representation that challenges the administration's aims\". More than 300 associates have signed the letter, using the name of their firm and class year, since it went live about a week ago, Politico reported.\n\nIn an internal email to its lawyers, Mr Karp defended the agreement, saying it was in line with the firm's principles, including a commitment to remaining politically independent, Reuters reported.\n\nThe firm brought in more than $2bn in annual revenues in 2023, and employed more than 1,000 attorneys, according to American Lawyer Magazine. Revoking its security clearance, which allows its lawyers to see some sensitive information, could have created hurdles to its work with its many corporate, security and Wall Street clients.\n\nIn the original executive order, Trump had accused the firm of playing \"an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles\".\n\nIt had cited \"a Paul Weiss partner\" who had filed a pro bono lawsuit against the perpetrators of the 6 January 2021 riots at the Capitol. Trump has released all and pardoned many of those known as \"J6ers\".\n\nIt also took direct aim at Mark Pomerantz - a former partner who had worked with the Manhattan District Attorney  on the case involving hush-money payments to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump was convicted by a jury last year of  having committed a felony in the case.\n\nThe order had also alleged that the firm \"discriminates against its own employees on the basis of race and other categories prohibited by civil rights laws\".\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship. Can he do it?\n\nIn one of his first acts as the 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending automatic citizenship rights for nearly anyone born on US territory - known as \"birthright citizenship\".\n\nIt's a policy change he's long promised - but implementing it won't be easy. It has faced legal challenges and has been taken by Trump to the US Supreme Court.\n\nTrump's order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or on temporary visas.\n\nBut it already has been blocked by courts in the early stages of what promises to be a long battle.\n\nMost legal scholars say the president doesn't have the power to unilaterally change the law in this area, which is based on an amendment in the US Constitution.\n\nThe first sentence of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution establishes the principle of birthright citizenship:\n\n\"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"\n\nImmigration hardliners argue that the policy is a \"great magnet for illegal immigration\" and that it encourages pregnant women to cross the border in order to give birth and remain in the US, an act that has been pejoratively called \"birth tourism\" or having an \"anchor baby\".\n\nSupporters of birthright citizenship point out that it has been the law of the land for well over a century and that eliminating it would create a \"permanent subclass of people born in the US who are denied full rights as Americans.\"\n\nThe concept of birthright citizenship, also known by the legal term \"jus soli\", is based in English common law and was generally accepted to apply to white men throughout early American history.\n\nHowever, it did not become part of the Constitution until 1868, when the 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.\n\nPrevious Supreme Court cases, like Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857, had determined that African Americans could never be US citizens. The 14th Amendment overrode that.\n\nIn 1898, the US Supreme Court ruled that birthright citizenship applies to the children of immigrants in the case of US v Wong Kim Ark.\n\nWong was a 24-year-old child of legal Chinese immigrants who was born in the US, but denied re-entry when he returned from a visit to China. Wong successfully argued that because he was born in the US, his parents' immigration status did not affect the application of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe court ruled in Wong's favour and outlined a few limited exceptions to birthright citizenship, such as for children of diplomats.\n\n\"Wong Kim Ark vs United States affirmed that regardless of race or the immigration status of one's parents, all persons born in the United States were entitled to all of the rights that citizenship offered,\" writes Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. \"The court has not re-examined this issue since then.\"\n\nMost legal scholars say President Trump cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.\n\n\"He's doing something that's going to upset a lot of people, but ultimately this will be decided by the courts,\" said Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional expert and University of Virginia Law School professor. \"This is not something he can decide on his own.\"\n\nMr Prakash said that while the president can order employees of federal agencies to interpret citizenship more narrowly - agents with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for example - that would trigger legal challenges from anyone whose citizenship is denied.\n\nThe Trump administration's arguments rest on the clause in the 14th Amendment that reads \" subject to the jurisdiction thereof\". It argues that the language excludes children of non-citizens who are in the US unlawfully.\n\nCourts have generally disagreed. In Plyler v Doe, a 1982 Supreme Court case involving a different part of the 14th Amendment, justices rejected an argument made by the state of Texas that undocumented immigrants were not \"persons within its jurisdiction\". The court ruled that migrants are both subject to US laws and granted the protections afforded by them.\n\nA constitutional amendment could do away with birthright citizenship, but that would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and approval by three quarters of US states - a virtual impossibility on such a controversial proposal, given the current finely balanced divide in American politics.\n\nAccording to Pew Research , about 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the United States in 2016, which is a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007. By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.\n\nBut as those children also have children, the cumulative effect of ending birthright citizenship could potentially increase the number of unauthorised immigrants in the country to 4.7m in 2050, the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, found.\n\nIn an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said he thought the children of unauthorised immigrants should be deported alongside their parents - even if they were born in the US.\n\n\"I don't want to be breaking up families,\" Trump said last December. \"So the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\"\n\nTrump has now taken the case to the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, after lower courts ruled against his plans.\n\nJudges in district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state have blocked nationwide enforcement of Trump's order.\n\nJohn Coughenour, a judge in Seattle, called it \"blatantly unconstitutional\" .\n\nTrump has tried to appeal the rulings. While he waits for the Supreme Court, birthright citizenship remains the law of the land.\n\nMore than 30 countries practise automatic \"jus soli\", or \"right of the soil\" without restriction in almost all cases.\n\nOther countries, like the UK and Australia, allow for a modified version where citizenship is automatically granted if one parent is a citizen or permanent resident.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

That dynamic reached another chaotic height this past weekend as the Trump administration seeks to further its policy of mass deportations.\n\nOver a 24-hour period that featured arrests, deportations, lawsuits, and apparent trolling from a foreign leader, lawyers and judges scrambled to respond to the administration's efforts to remove immigrants it claims to be especially dangerous.\n\nWhat happened exactly is still unclear. But the events represent the new logistical - and constitutional - strains being placed on the United States' judges and courts.\n\nAs President Trump implements his agenda at lightning speed, a growing number of judges tell him to roll back those actions until lawsuits can be heard. So far, the injunctions are drawing mixed responses from the executive branch.\n\nIn two cases, court orders meant to temporarily block the White House deportations have, at best, not arrived in time. At worst, the court orders have been ignored. Judges in both cases are now working through the particulars, but legal experts say that either scenario has troubling implications.\n\nThe Trump administration \"has really taken to heart the motto of 'move fast and break things,'\" says Daniel Farber, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley law school.\n\nThis has led to some losses in court, he adds, but \"Even if they're eventually told to stop what they're doing, or to reverse what they're doing, just the fact that they've done it has an impact.\"\n\nAs President Trump's administration moves fast and breaks things, observers worry that the balance of powers could be among those things getting broken.\n\n\"Courts are not going to stop us,\" said Tom Homan, Mr. Trump's \"border czar,\" in a Fox News interview earlier this week that raised alarm bells. \"We're going to make this country safe again.\"\n\nPresident Trump then followed Mr. Homan's volley with a call on Tuesday for a judge who ruled against his administration to be impeached - the fourth judge to face impeachment threats after ruling against Trump policies. In a rare public rebuke to the president, U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts fired back: \"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe question of courts maintaining an administrative and legal status quo, while Trump administration actions are litigated, has arisen in many cases including those concerning a Lebanese work-visa holder, Venezuelan migrants, fired federal employees, and contractors owed payment for completed work.\n\nWhile preliminary rulings went against him this weekend, and while there are questions over whether federal officials complied, it's still possible that Mr. Trump ultimately prevails. But Mr. Homan's comments after a dramatic weekend suggest that judges need to scrutinize compliance carefully.\n\nOn March 15, the federal government deported over 200 migrants to El Salvador, including some Venezuelans whom the government claims are members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a violent gang founded in 2014 in a Venezuelan prison.\n\nThe deportations were fast-tracked after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act earlier that day. This 1798 law allows the president to unilaterally deport citizens of a country at war with the U.S., and Mr. Trump has claimed that TdA is \"conducting irregular warfare against\" the United States. A lawsuit challenging that claim quickly followed, brought by five alleged TdA gang members. But during a hearing that night on the case in Washington, two planes full of migrants left Texas and began flying south.\n\nLater that evening - after, it seems , Judge James Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations and ordered the government to call back planes carrying them out - the two aircraft landed in El Salvador.\n\nThe next morning, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele posted on social media a picture of a headline about Judge Boasberg's order. \"Oopsie,\" he wrote. \"Too late.\" By Sunday afternoon, President Bukele's office had released video clips believed to be images of migrants being escorted off a plane and taken to a prison where incarcerated people are reportedly subjected to torture and beatings.\n\nSimilar confusion broke out in Massachusetts last weekend when Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a Brown University assistant professor and kidney specialist living in the U.S. on a specialist worker visa, was denied entry into the country after a monthlong trip to her native Lebanon. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents stopped her after finding materials \"sympathetic\" to Hezbollah on her phone, according to court documents filed by the government this week .\n\nIn the hours that followed, Judge Leo Sorokin issued an order that Dr. Alawieh was not to be moved without 48 hours' notice pending a review of her case. But the next day, she was put on a flight to Lebanon via Paris. Prosecutors said that CBP agents had not heard about the court order when they did so, according to court filings.\n\n\"At no time would [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] not take a court order seriously,\" a CBP official wrote in a sworn declaration.\n\nThe government response in the TdA case has been different. In a hearing in that case on Monday, the government argued that Judge Boasberg lost jurisdiction over the El Salvador flights once they left U.S. airspace.\n\n\"I think it's pretty clear that my equitable powers don't stop at the water's edge, at the airspace's edge,\" Judge Boasberg responded. \"Isn't the response to what you perceive as an unconstitutional or improper order to appeal it,\" he added, \"rather than going forward and saying, 'We'll do what we want'?\"\n\nConservatives argue that these fast-paced actions are a necessary response after four years of soft immigration enforcement under President Joe Biden.\n\n\"President Trump is using every tool he has to expedite the removal of people,\" says Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \"Maybe he will be successful with this process; maybe he won't.\"\n\nBut fast-paced executive actions, as seen this past weekend, can risk at least the appearance of judicial orders being ignored. Now, compliance with court orders on immigration actions and others is something federal judges around the country are wading into.\n\nThese are complex, granular issues far removed from the important questions, such as whether Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is lawful. But legal experts say judicial review here is critical to the balance of powers underpinning U.S. democracy.\n\n\"An understanding that government agencies, government actors, will abide by federal court rulings [is] fundamental to our system of government,\" says Denise Gilman, co-director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law.\n\nThe trend appears to be that the executive branch is straddling the line between obeying the courts and waiting for appeals or delaying making the ordered changes.\n\nIn two cases, for example, the Trump administration has been ordered to rehire probationary employees fired over the past two months. But court filings the government submitted on Monday revealed that of the roughly 24,500 employees terminated by the government, almost all have been rehired and then immediately placed on administrative leave.\n\nIn another case, Judge Amir Ali has ordered the government to make payments from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for work already completed before administration officials paused all payments from the agency. Trump administration lawyers have said those payments have since been unfrozen. But they're now being reviewed case by case before being released.\n\nJudge Ali said earlier this month that he is working to ensure that the government complies with the payments order while \"ensuring that due regard is given to feasibility.\" In a status report last week, the organizations that brought the suit claimed they are still awaiting $228 million in payments for work completed before the initial USAID funding pause.\n\nThe government said it expects to finish processing the payments this week. Another status report is due today.\n\nThat same kind of legal standoff is ongoing under Judge Sorokin in Massachusetts and Judge Boasberg in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"All of this is sort of nitpicky procedural stuff,\" says Professor Farber. But if a judge wants to determine if the government \"deliberately disobeyed\" their order, he adds, \"the judge is going to have to deal with all those arguments.\"\n\nEditors's note: This story was updated to note that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents, not Border Patrol agents, interacted with Dr. Rasha Alawieh of Brown University.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplish in four years or eight years - and we are just getting started,\" Mr. Trump declared in his first joint address to Congress since returning to the White House.\n\nThe speech comes amid a wild sprint in American history. Mr. Trump has deputized billionaire Elon Musk to slash the federal government , laying off thousands of workers in unpredictable spurts. Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance upbraided the president of Ukraine in the Oval Office last Friday, then cut off military aid to the U.S. ally. And the stock market has just gone through a two-day selloff triggered by the president's decision to levy heavy tariffs on Canada and Mexico, the U.S.'s top trading partners.\n\nIn his first speech to Congress since retaking office, President Donald Trump touted his accomplishments on the border and going after waste in government. On the economy, he cautioned that there might be 'a little disturbance.'\n\nPresidential joint addresses and State of the Union speeches are often dull laundry lists of policy proposals. This was lighter on that front than normal - even compared to Mr. Trump's previous addresses - and more focused on political score-settling. The president brought in guests to highlight political wedge issues, from immigration and crime to transgender women in sports.\n\nThe speech itself isn't likely to have a lasting legacy. What matters more for Mr. Trump's political future is the issue that handed him the election - inflation. If his tariffs, massive government layoffs, proposed tax plans, and other actions help boost the economy, his approval rating will likely hold steady or rise, and he'll have more leeway for his other policies. If they trigger higher prices and rising unemployment rates, his presidency may soon be on the rocks.\n\nMr. Trump spent a solid chunk of his long speech blaming his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for high inflation, while defending his tariff plan. In a notable moment, he tacitly admitted the tariffs might cause short-term economic pain.\n\n\"Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're OK with that. It won't be much,\" he promised.\n\nHe said that wider reciprocal tariffs will land on April 2.\n\n\"I wanted to make it April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day,\" he said. \"I'm a very superstitious person.\"\n\nThe acrimony in the room was palpable all night, in both directions. Not long after Mr. Trump began his speech, Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas stood up and shouted that he didn't have a mandate to cut Medicaid (as might occur through Republican legislation), waving his cane at the president. After refusing to sit down, he was escorted out of the House chamber, as some Republican lawmakers gleefully chanted \"sha-nah-nah-nah, hey hey hey, goodbye.\"\n\nMr. Trump opened his speech by bragging about his 2024 election win. He relitigated his criminal cases: \"We ended weaponized government where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. How did that work out? Not too good,\" he said. He slammed Democrats on border security. He went on a long riff making misleading claims about widespread Social Security fraud based on deceptive figures about people over the age of 100 in the program's database that he suggested were receiving benefits. He executed made-for-TV moments, like making a 13-year-old who had been diagnosed with brain cancer an honorary U.S. Secret Service agent.\n\nAnd time and again, Mr. Trump gleefully trolled Democrats.\n\n\"This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy, or to make them stand or smile or applaud. Nothing I can do,\" he said early on. \"For the good of our nation, let's work together, and let's truly make America great again.\"\n\nHe later interrupted his remarks to mock Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as \"Pocahontas,\" his longtime nickname for her. Senator Warren clapped sardonically, and told reporters afterward that Mr. Trump's speech had been \"one lie heaped on another.\"\n\nDemocrats tried - and largely failed - to find a cohesive way to push back. As Mr. Trump boasted about his strong support for law enforcement, some in the chamber yelled back \"Jan. 6,\" referring to his supporters' Capitol riot, which wounded many police officers. Democratic lawmakers filed out in dribs and drabs, though most of them weren't shown on TV broadcasts. They held up black-and-white signs saying \"Musk steals\" and \"False.\" But the pushback was disjointed.\n\nMr. Trump went very long, basking in the moment. He was at the podium for just under 100 minutes, the longest joint session or State of the Union in modern history.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

President Trump has been moving with lightning speed to carry out his agenda - signing a blizzard of executive orders and empowering Elon Musk's task force, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to remake the federal bureaucracy, as it dismantles agencies and pushes out civil servants.\n\nAmerica's founders, wanting to prevent political factions, gave equal power to Congress, the courts, and the executive branch. President Donald Trump's actions are stressing that delicate balance.\n\nIn the process, President Trump is essentially doing an end run around Congress, which holds the \"power of the purse.\" But rather than trying to stop him, Republican lawmakers - who control both houses of Congress - are mostly urging him to keep going.\n\nMr. Trump is also rhetorically challenging the authority of the judicial branch. He has attacked judges as \"liberal activists\" and suggested that anything he does to \"save\" the country cannot be illegal - though he has also stated that he would abide by court rulings .\n\nTo Democrats and many scholars, the situation has all the markings of a constitutional crisis: The president is upending the United States' centuries-old balance of power as laid out by the Founding Fathers. Instead of three co-equal branches acting as a check on each other, power has become increasingly concentrated over the years in the White House - a trend that is now being supercharged under Mr. Trump in ways that, to critics, raise the specter of authoritarianism.\n\n\"The executive branch is expanding its powers beyond what any other administration has tried to do,\" says Shana Kushner Gadarian, a professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University. \"That's the crisis we're in.\"\n\nTo justify their actions, Mr. Trump and his supporters argue it's the status quo that has broken to the point of being undemocratic. The federal bureaucracy had grown so large and Congress so gridlocked, they say, that it had become impossible for the government to do what the voters want.\n\n\"It does not match the will of the people,\" Mr. Musk, the world's wealthiest person, said during a recent informal press conference with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last week. Voters, though, gave Mr. Trump a relatively narrow victory, with slightly less than half of the more than 155 million votes cast.\n\nThe bureaucracy, the tech executive said, had become an \"unelected, fourth, unconstitutional branch of government - which has, in a lot of ways, currently, more power than any elected representative.\"\n\nIn just one month, Mr. Trump - aided by Mr. Musk and his DOGE team - has dramatically cut foreign aid by almost entirely eliminating the U.S. Agency for International Development, begun dismantling the Department of Education, and raised alarm bells over the safety of taxpayer information at the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service as DOGE aides look for evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress are complying as Mr. Trump usurps the power of the national legislature, as laid out in Article 1 of the Constitution. But some are quietly pushing back, particularly those in battleground districts who at times espouse centrist positions.\n\nTake GOP Rep. Don Bacon, who represents such a district in Nebraska. Though he supports the elimination of the watchdog Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he says it must be done correctly.\n\n\"We have got to follow the law,\" Representative Bacon told CNN. \"If there are things we have to redirect, let's do it the constitutional way.\"\n\nStill, voices like Mr. Bacon's are few and far between; the vast majority of Republicans in Congress occupy safe GOP seats. If they face a threat, it's a primary challenge from the right if they are perceived as anti-Trump. And they know that the vast resources available to the Republican Party - including Mr. Musk's billions - could potentially support such a challenger.\n\nCompounding the issue is the fact that Republican control of both houses of Congress is exceedingly narrow, with members on both sides unwilling in most cases to break party ranks. This makes Mr. Trump inherently weak in his ability to pass the more controversial elements of his agenda through Congress. So he is focusing on executive actions - even though several have been challenged in court and could prove to be illegal.\n\nPartisan polarization, growing for decades, hinders Congress' ability to claw back its own power. \"Never Trump\" Republicans, including outspoken former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, are now in the political wilderness. And the center has hollowed out, a reflection of the gerrymandering that has made most congressional districts safe for one or the other major party.\n\nThis scenario demonstrates why the Founding Fathers didn't mention political parties in the Constitution. They were concerned about factions. But human nature suggests that factions were inevitable, and the founders knew that, says Barbara Perry, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.\n\n\"They hoped that they had figured out what [James] Madison called 'the extent and proper structure' of our country,\" Dr. Perry says. \"The structures were all these checks and balances.\"\n\nBut what they weren't counting on was lockstep partisanship, which translates today into a pro-Trump, pro-MAGA congressional majority that is likely to reinforce the president's agenda, at least until the 2026 midterm elections. But even some Republicans are distressed enough by the administration withholding congressionally approved funding that they are asking President Trump to release money meant for farmers and infrastructure projects, among other things.\n\nCongress ceding power to the president, and the president aggressively taking it, is not just a Republican phenomenon. It's been happening for decades. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat who took office amid the Great Depression, signed hundreds of executive orders in his first year and, unlike President Trump so far, got Congress to pass major pieces of legislation that massively expanded the federal government.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in 2001, Republican President George W. Bush created the current-day homeland security structure, and aggressively used \"signing statements\" when he signed bills into law. Such statements, though not legally binding, provided interpretations of the law that pushed the envelope of executive power.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama's Democrats lost control of Congress in his first midterm elections, he used what he called a \"pen and phone\" strategy to enact his agenda: the signing of executive actions and phone calls to outside groups to put pressure on Congress to pass legislation.\n\nMore recently, President Joe Biden signed more than 40 executive orders in his first 100 days, a record for the post-FDR era. Many of those orders were efforts to undo what his predecessor, Mr. Trump, had done - creating a pingpong effect as administrations change hands and parties. Mr. Trump has now undone many of Mr. Biden's orders, signing more than 60 of his own so far .\n\nEfforts to reform or rein in the executive branch have waxed and waned over the years.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan set up the Grace Commission, chaired by businessman J. Peter Grace, to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. While most of its recommendations were never implemented, the commission is credited with conceptualizing future efforts to rein in the federal bureaucracy.\n\nPerhaps the most successful government restructuring was launched in 1993 by Vice President Al Gore. In its five years, the National Partnership for Reinventing Government eliminated more than 100 programs and 250,000 federal jobs, and consolidated more than 800 agencies. But unlike Mr. Trump's effort, the Gore initiative involved careful review of programs and expenditures before action was taken.\n\nBy all appearances, President Biden lacked interest in government reform. During his first two years in office, he launched only two reform initiatives , compared with 37 during President Bill Clinton's two terms and 31 during the Reagan presidency. As a result, President Biden may have helped pave the way for the current Trump-Musk effort. Public trust in democracy has been in near-steady decline since the 1980s. A recent uptick in Gallup polling , after the November election and before Mr. Trump's inauguration, reflects higher satisfaction among Republicans.\n\nMr. Musk has latched on to public unhappiness with government and turned it into a crusade. The DOGE team has been going into the data systems of various government agencies targeted for downsizing or outright elimination, alarming public-interest watchdogs.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Musk's efforts, and made him a \"special government employee\" amid concerns that the multibillionaire was operating without any legal guidelines or oversight. One looming question centers on Mr. Musk's many corporate interests that have business with the federal government, and whether he is benefiting from DOGE's actions. When asked, he denies any conflict of interest.\n\nFor American governance writ large, the biggest test is yet to come. Legal challenges to many of Mr. Trump's actions are in court, and a key question is, What happens if the Supreme Court rules against him? Does he comply?\n\nOr will Mr. Trump follow the example of an earlier disrupter in chief, President Andrew Jackson, whose portrait hangs in the Oval Office? In 1832, President Jackson famously ignored a Supreme Court ruling on Native American rights, and challenged the high court to enforce its decision. It could not.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

President Donald Trump has, critics say, taken this practice to an extreme over the past month.\n\nSaying that he is fulfilling a campaign promise to cut waste and root out fraud in Washington, President Trump and his administration have frozen vast sums of dollars of congressionally appropriated funds. He has, without an official reason, fired at least four Senate-confirmed agency officials as well as 17 independent agency inspectors general. His subordinates have gutted two federal agencies.\n\nAre these actions legal? Dozens of lawsuits are probing the questions. Legal scholars disagree on how the cases could turn out. But they tend to agree that if the actions the Trump administration is taking are extreme, they are also, in another sense, predictable.\n\nPresidential power has steadily expanded over the past century. Under the Trump administration, the Supreme Court will face questions about the bounds of that expansion.\n\nThe past century has been marked by a steady expansion of presidential power. As heads of the most nimble and proactive branch of government, the United States' chief executives have sought greater authority. As the U.S. has become a superpower in a fast-paced, globalized world, Congress and the judiciary have willingly delegated this power. The U.S. Supreme Court punctuated the trend last year when it ruled that former presidents are mostly immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nThe president is unique in our system of government, Chief Justice John Roberts asserted in that decision. \"Unlike anyone else,\" he wrote, \"the president is a branch of government.\"\n\nThe public, however, seems wary. According to a Pew Research Center survey published last week, 78% of Americans say it would be \"too risky\" to expand presidential power. Now, as President Trump is claiming even more power for the executive branch, the justices face the foundational question: Just how much power should that branch - should that person - have?\n\nThe first sentence in Article 2 of the Constitution says the executive power \"shall be vested in\" the president. Beyond that, it articulates a few specific powers, including the power to make treaties and appoint \"officers of the United States.\"\n\nFor more than 100 years, the presidency was relatively constrained. But at the turn of the 20th century, that began to change. President Theodore Roosevelt asserted that he had the right to all powers not explicitly denied him . Decades later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt transformed Americans' views of what the president could - or should - do with a flurry of actions in his first 100 days .\n\nAs America has modernized and become a global superpower, its executive branch has grown in power and physical size. A branch that in 1789 had five Cabinet members and one federal agency now includes 16 Cabinet members and hundreds of federal agencies. Between 1940 and 2014, the number of civilian employees in the branch more than tripled .\n\nConservatives have long criticized this expansion, arguing that federal agencies are now a de facto fourth branch of government - and one that is unelected and unaccountable to the public. While some presidents have tried over the years to trim layers of government workers, President Trump is now attempting to exert more control over these federal agencies, arguing that it's necessary to fulfill a campaign promise to reduce waste and eliminate government fraud.\n\n\"We are returning to the founders' vision for what government ought to look like,\" says Daniel Suhr, president of the Center for American Rights, a conservative legal organization. \"That is the president at the top of the executive branch, and the officers under him being responsible to follow through on the policy direction he gives.\"\n\nMr. Trump's efforts are being led by what he has named the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a temporary agency he created without congressional approval and that he alone oversees. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, is a key adviser on this executive branch shakeup. (After his election, the president tapped Mr. Musk to lead the agency, but the administration has suggested in a new court filing that, legally, Mr. Musk is not affiliated with DOGE.)\n\nThose efforts have translated into some unprecedented, controversial moves not just from the executive branch but also from the president himself.\n\nOver the past month, Trump officials have effectively shuttered the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. His administration has frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in grants and funds approved by the legislature. President Trump fired at least four leaders of independent federal agencies and 17 agency watchdogs, though it's unclear if he had the authority to do so.\n\nOn Tuesday, he signed another executive order asserting the president's direct control over agencies that have long been understood to be largely independent, such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n\"Investigations of government structures and efficiencies have happened in the past,\" says Mitchel Sollenberger, a political science professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. But with these latest Trump administration moves, \"They're stopping money; they're restructuring ... departments,\" he says. \"I haven't seen that before.\"\n\nFive people who have played a role in this expansion of executive power now sit on the Supreme Court.\n\nChief Justice Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, for example, worked in the U.S. Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan. Justice Elena Kagan was a top DOJ official under President Barack Obama. And Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh both worked in the George W. Bush administration, the former as a DOJ official and the latter as a White House official.\n\nNo members of the court have much legislative experience, however. That means \"They come with a probably unavoidable - because they're human - impulse to give more weight to interests they find familiar or recognizable,\" says Aziz Huq, a University of Chicago Law School professor.\n\nWhen determining if a branch of government is trying to usurp the authority of other branches, they're likely \"giving more weight to the executive than to Congress because they're more familiar with what it means to work in the executive,\" he adds.\n\nThis may explain, in part, the court's unprecedented ruling on presidential immunity last year. Chief Justice Roberts, a former DOJ and White House lawyer, wrote that fear of prosecution would overly burden the \"'vigor' and 'energy'\" of the president. That sentence quoted Alexander Hamilton, an early advocate for a strong presidency.\n\nThe president doesn't have \"an unlimited grant of power,\" says Mr. Suhr of the Center for American Rights. But what \"the Supreme Court has reminded us in the past decade is [that] the president is the executive branch, and he has the right to control his branch and his appointees.\"\n\nIn an effort to gain more direct control over the executive branch, some of Mr. Trump's recent actions seem to directly challenge these separation-of-powers concerns. The administration Feb. 16, for example, asked the high court to uphold the president's firing of the head of an independent agency that protects government whistleblowers.\n\nCourts will be weighing in on other assertions of presidential power in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe Supreme Court has said the president can fire certain federal agency leaders, for example. But does that mean he can unilaterally fire leaders at independent agencies like the Federal Election Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, as he did earlier this month?\n\nLast year the court rejected a challenge seeking to shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, holding that its funding mechanism is constitutional. So can DOGE effectively shutter the agency by limiting its funding and pausing its activities?\n\nBy law, the executive branch can only \"impound\" certain funds and must otherwise spend money as appropriated by Congress. What does that mean for the freeze on federal grants?\n\nSo while some of Mr. Trump's actions may be considered \"a continuation\" of the decadeslong expansion of presidential power, says Professor Huq, others are \"so comprehensive that it's hard not to see [them] as a claim for a fundamentally different kind of constitutional order.\"\n\nLast summer brought a landmark ruling from the Supreme Court expanding the limits of presidential power.\n\nThis summer could well bring another one.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated on Feb. 19, the day of initial publication, to reflect an additional Trump executive order.

But as a front in America's culture wars, the topic has become increasingly contentious. The growing visibility of transgender people in society and pop culture, and the spread of new ideas around sex and gender, particularly among young people, have led to emotional public debates about single-sex spaces and sports - and prompted a backlash on the right that's gone into overdrive since President Donald Trump returned to office.\n\nAs part of his \"war on woke,\" Mr. Trump has enacted a flurry of policies directly impacting various aspects of life for transgender people. The president has issued executive actions barring transgender women from women's sports teams and women's prisons . He's ordered the military to oust transgender soldiers and stop recruiting others. He's banned federal funding for gender-transition medical treatments for minors , threatened to withhold funding from schools that \"indoctrinate\" children, and prevented transgender individuals from self-selecting their gender on passports and other official documents.\n\nThe barrage of actions has left members of the transgender community reeling, while Democrats have been divided over how to respond. \"It's truly terrifying,\" says the Rev. Lazarus Jameson, a transgender pastor in Oregon. \"Every trans person is asking, How are we going to survive?\"\n\nActions by the Trump administration have been pushing back on transgender inclusion, amid sharp public divides and emotional debates over things like women's sports and care for children.\n\nThe Trump administration casts all these moves as a return to \"common sense,\" protecting women and children from the impacts of what they say is a dangerous social contagion. \"Ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women's domestic abuse shelters to women's workplace showers. This is wrong,\" states one of Mr. Trump's executive orders . \"Efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of their dignity, safety, and well-being.\"\n\nTransgender people and their allies reject those characterizations, calling transgender inclusion a matter of human dignity and basic rights. Many of the president's directives have already triggered legal injunctions halting their implementation; on Tuesday, a judge temporarily blocked the transgender military ban from taking effect. Some appear to contradict a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2020 that protected transgender people from workplace discrimination. Democratic-run states are also pushing back and strengthening legal protections for transgender residents.\n\nYet the politics surrounding the issue are dicey for both parties. Following November's election, some Democrats have grown concerned that their party's full-throated support for protecting transgender rights under all circumstances was alienating mainstream voters and ignoring valid concerns about women's rights and the unknown effects of transgender youth medicine. The shifting political winds were underscored recently when California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a longtime ally of the transgender community, said on his podcast that he believed allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports was \"deeply unfair.\"\n\nOther Democrats, however, predict Mr. Trump's aggressive policies may soon invite a backlash of their own. While polls suggest the president's position on transgender athletes has widespread public support, the sheer scope of his directives, and the open hostility expressed by some of his allies toward transgender individuals, may ultimately strike voters as needlessly punitive toward a vulnerable minority population. One of Mr. Trump's very first executive orders , signed Jan. 20, states flatly that there are only \"two sexes\" and they are \"not changeable\" - essentially making it the official position of the United States government that all people must adhere to this binary. Critics say it amounts to denying transgender individuals' very existence.\n\nMost Americans' views tend to be far more nuanced than the political positioning being put forward by either party, experts say. Polling shows that a majority of people support transgender rights when it comes to things like housing and employment. But when accommodations for transgender individuals are in apparent conflict with other people's rights, \"Support is a lot more squishy,\" says Donald Haider-Markel, a politics professor at the University of Kansas who studies LGBTQ+ issues and public opinion.\n\nFor now, he adds, the greater political dilemma lies with Democrats, who pride themselves on championing minority rights, but are also trying to chart their way back to an electoral majority. They need to win some of the culturally conservative, working-class voters drawn to Mr. Trump's masculine imagery and emphasis on traditional gender roles. \"The party is really in the weeds on how to go forward on this, and nobody has staked out a middle path that everyone can agree on,\" says Professor Haider-Markel.\n\nTo Mr. Trump's critics, the administration is scapegoating what amounts to a tiny number of people purely for political gain. According to a recent Gallup estimate , 1.3% of all American adults are transgender. The numbers have been rising among young people , however: Among Generation Z respondents, 4.1% identify as transgender, compared with less than 1% of adults born before 1980. Far more adults identify as gay, lesbian, or bixsexual, a percentage that has been steadily rising since Gallup began counting in 2012. (Nearly 1 in 10 now identify as LGBTQ+.)\n\nWhile gay rights advocates rapidly gained popular support and then a 2015 Supreme Court victory established a constitutional right for same-sex marriage, the transgender community is facing growing skepticism and even hostility from conservatives.\n\nMr. Trump's biggest ad buy in the 2024 campaign highlighted Vice President Kamala Harris' support for taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for prisoners - an ad that strategists from both parties described as devastatingly effective . Mr. Trump's campaign flooded battleground states with versions of the ad, which concluded with the tagline, \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\" A postelection poll by the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, found that 64% of voters had seen ads that criticized Ms. Harris for supporting transition surgery for prisoners and allowing transgender athletes to play on girls' sports teams.\n\nThe president has leaned particularly into the sports issue, where polls show his position has high levels of public support. A New York Times survey from January found that 79% of respondents believed that athletes who were male at birth should not be allowed to compete in women's sports. Since recapturing the White House, Mr. Trump has held photo ops with female athletes, and invited a volleyball player who suffered an injury competing against a transgender player to his speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\n\"Asking people to pretend that sex isn't real or doesn't matter, or that it's the same thing as gender, has been a huge unforced error\" by Democrats, says Doriane Coleman, a professor at Duke Law School. \"It's also been an unnecessary one, as there are different strategies that could have secured protections for trans people that didn't go to the core of such a significant aspect of most of our lives,\" she adds, referring to the sports question.\n\nWhen some Democrats have tried to modulate their party's position, they've often experienced significant pushback. After Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton told The New York Times shortly after the November election that he didn't want his daughters \"run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete,\" he was hit with a flood of criticism from fellow Democrats, and his campaign manager resigned. The recent comments from Governor Newsom, along with moves from other Democrats to drop pronouns from their bios and move away from \"woke\" language , suggest those internal debates are far from over.\n\nStill, others argue that the actions the president has taken have unleashed a wave of hostility toward transgender people that's likely to repel swing voters. In the first few days of this congressional session, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina publicly and successfully campaigned to prevent the House's first transgender member, Delaware Rep. Sarah McBride, from using the women's restrooms in the Capitol. More recently, GOP lawmakers have publicly referred to Representative McBride in hearings and elsewhere as \"Mr. McBride.\"\n\nEric Stern, a Democratic strategist in Pennsylvania who worked to elect Sen. John Fetterman in 2022, says \"being cruel\" toward transgender people will ultimately come back to bite Republicans, even if they reap short-term electoral gains. Voters \"are going to come around and see what it is, which is a bully picking on a vulnerable community,\" he says.\n\nSenator Fetterman has frequently criticized his fellow Democrats for using \"woke\" language and has sharply broken with the pro-Palestinian left. But he's remained a staunch defender of transgender rights. Earlier this month, after a GOP bill to bar transgender girls from school athletic competitions failed along party lines, Senator Fetterman posted on the social platform X , \"The small handful of trans athletes in PA in a political maelstrom deserve an ally and I am one.\"\n\nMr. Stern argues that Democrats who distance themselves from transgender issues that seem unpopular right now are making a bad long-term calculation. \"I don't believe it's in the interest of Democrats to throw the trans community under the bus. It's completely reprehensible morally, and I don't think our base will reward us for sacrificing a community,\" he says.\n\nPolls point to a mixed picture when it comes to public support for transgender rights. A Gallup poll from May 2024 found that a majority of Americans opposed state laws banning medical treatments for transgender youth, but half also said it was \"morally wrong\" to change one's gender. The January New York Times poll found that 71% of Americans believed no one under age 18 should have access to puberty blockers or cross-sex hormone treatments.\n\nAnother poll in 2023 by The Washington Post/KFF found that 57% of Americans believe it's not possible for a person to be a different gender from their sex at birth. But a majority of respondents in that poll also supported laws prohibiting discrimination, including 65% who opposed discriminating against trans people serving in the U.S. military.\n\nSome Democrats argue that Republican targeting of transgender rights echoes the party's opposition to same-sex marriage in 2004 under President George W. Bush. The Bush campaign leaned heavily into that issue, using ballot referendums against same-sex marriage to help turn out religious voters in the presidential election, while many Democratic officials tried to strike an uneasy middle ground, supporting civil unions rather than marriage. But in the years that followed, public opinion abruptly shifted, with Democrats and ultimately many Republicans embracing the landmark Supreme Court ruling affirming a right to same-sex marriage in 2015.\n\nSome experts point to key differences between the two issues - and the ways the campaigns for rights were waged. Advocates for same-sex marriage purposely highlighted traditional values as part of their campaign. \"[People said,] 'Oh, same-sex couples, they just want to be normal. They want to get married,'\" says Darel Paul, a politics professor at Williams College and author of \"From Tolerance to Equality: How Elites Brought America to Same-Sex Marriage.\"\n\nWhile social and religious conservatives argued that allowing same-sex unions would undermine the institution of marriage, they ultimately failed to persuade the majority of Americans, who generally support allowing consenting adults to make their own decisions. But that's not the case with gender-transition treatments for children under age 18.\n\nOne of Mr. Trump's executive orders, which is already being litigated in federal court, prohibits federal funding or support for gender-transition treatments for minors, which he labels \"chemical and surgical mutilation\" procedures that young people may regret later in life. While U.S. medical associations support these treatments and say they are evidence-based, authorities in Europe have begun restricting them and urging greater caution in diagnosing gender dysphoria, the condition of feeling trapped in the wrong gender.\n\nLast month the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case involving a challenge to a Tennessee ban on transition medicine for minors. Tennessee is among more than a dozen Republican-run states that have imposed bans and restrictions on these practices in the past few years. In 2023, Missouri passed a ban on transition care over the opposition of parents of transgender children amid a controversy over alleged malpractice at a leading transgender clinic in St. Louis.\n\nThat was when Jameson, a social-care worker who had led a church in St. Louis, decided to leave Missouri, relocating to Oregon.\n\nJameson has been disappointed by the muted response from Democratic leaders to Mr. Trump's executive actions, though welcoming of the support from blue states. \"A lot of politicians don't seem to think trans people are worth the fight,\" Jameson says.\n\nTransgender advocates argue that, like same-sex marriage proponents in the early 2000s, they also just want to pursue a normal life - and the Trump administration is standing in their way.\n\nA group of transgender service members has sued the administration over its ban on transgender troops, arguing that it violates their constitutional rights to equal protection. This week, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking the ban's implementation while the lawsuit works its way through the courts.\n\nThe executive action issued Jan. 27 makes categorical and unfounded claims about transgender soldiers and why they are unfit to serve, says David Gans, a constitutional attorney.\n\nHis organization, the Constitutional Accountability Center, filed an amicus brief in the suit that highlights the parallels between the exclusion of transgender service members and that of other groups once deemed unfit to serve their country - including Black people, gays and lesbians, and women in combat roles. In all these cases, the argument against integration was essentially the same: that allowing them to serve would endanger military effectiveness and unit cohesion.\n\n\"The lesson of history is that these [arguments] tend to rest on prejudices and discriminatory stereotypes,\" says Mr. Gans, who directs his organization's Human Rights, Civil Rights, and Citizenship Program.\n\nThe Pentagon says the number of transgender service members is in the low thousands . But one outside study estimates the number might be as high as 15,000 , which would make the Department of Defense the largest employer of transgender adults in the U.S., one that has provided gender-transition treatments for active and reserve service members. On Monday, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it would no longer provide hormone therapy to veterans who weren't already receiving such treatment.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It's planted on car dashboards. The city of Mississauga, next door to Toronto, this week raised oversize Canadian flags outside its city hall. It also removed the American flags that had been waving along the shores of Lake Ontario and in arenas where American teams often face off against Canadian hockey rivals.\n\nJust a decade ago, newly inaugurated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Canada the \"first postnational state\" - a multicultural country bounded not necessarily by a flag but by modern shared values.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's harsh tone toward Canada has spurred a rising nationalism to the north, albeit in a relatively friendly, Canadian-style form. Evidence of the shift: newly prominent maple-leaf flags dotting the landscape in support of the Canadian - not an American - state.\n\nToday, with U.S. President Donald Trump launching a full-scale trade war and threatening to subsume Canada as America's 51st state, that feels like ancient history, even if Alvin Tedjo, a Mississauga city councillor, says the move is \"less anti-American and more pro-Canadian.\"\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney, who took office on March 14, is unlikely to echo Mr. Trudeau's definition of Canada as a place with \"no core identity.\"\n\n\"You might have been able to get away with it last year,\" says Heather Nicol, director of the School for the Study of Canada at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario. \"But not this year, no.\"\n\nIndeed, in just two months, nationalism - albeit Canadian style - has proved to hold a powerful allure. \"You can't be post-national if you're not national,\" says Dr. Nicol. \"[With] the Trump threat we define ourselves now as a state. We are the Canadian state. Not the 51st state, but the Canadian state.\"\n\nMr. Carney has quickly struck a defiant new tone. \"The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country. If they succeed, they will destroy our way of life,\" he said. \"America is not Canada. And Canada never, ever, will be part of America in any way, shape, or form.\"\n\nThis is not the first time the United States has threatened Canadian sovereignty. It's a theme that predates the founding of Canada itself. Capturing the territory was a \"mere matter of marching,\" per the infamous words of Thomas Jefferson in drumming up support for war against the British Empire in 1812. But President Trump has articulated it more forcefully, and more often, than any time in Canada's 158-year history.\n\nIn response, Canadians are running the flags up the pole - with the maple leaf conveying new meaning and a certain solidarity.\n\nThe Canadian flag, which is just 60 years old, has never cropped up everywhere from cars to lawns to gas stations, as the Stars and Stripes does in the U.S. But now, flagmakers and sellers across the nation are reporting that sales are soaring, according to media reports; meanwhile, Mississauga is the third city in Ontario to have ordered the lowering of American flags.\n\nAnxious but angry, Canadians are boycotting American products and forgoing American vacations. \"Buy Canada\" campaigns are gaining ground from the top down and the bottom up. But Canadians don't tend to like what they classify as American-style patriotism.\n\nWhen the Freedom Convoy, a group angry at the government for vaccine mandates during the pandemic, flew the maple Leaf in 2022 during blockades in Ottawa, for example, it evoked the kind of nationalism that many Canadians eschew.\n\nYet the recent U.S. tone, says Mr. Tedjo, the city councillor, has pushed Canadians toward a renewed appreciation for what it means to be Canadian. \"Canadians have rallied around the flag in the last several months,\" he says. \"I think it's good for Canadians to understand how we're different.\"\n\nStill, to be Canadian is also to be a neighbor, many Canadians say. At the pier at Snug Harbour, where Lake Ontario feeds into the Credit River, Roy Clifton says he has mixed feelings. The co-owner of a restaurant, who sports a Yankees cap, is not against Americans or their flag, but against their president. \"It's really sad what has happened. This is hurting Canadians, and it's hurting Americans,\" he says.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nAt Mississauga City Hall, Jordan Currie, a young writer, says she doesn't trust the term \"postnational.\" It reminds her of \"post-feminism.\" To her, it's clear that society has not yet moved beyond the need to fight gender inequality or nativism. She worries that the spat between Canada and the U.S. could bring out the worst nationalist tendencies in both countries.\n\nWhen she sees the Canadian flags, like the new ones right behind her, \"I'm not like, 'ew,' \" she says. She hopes it stays that way.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

Courts, and public opinion, are weighing in.\n\nIn an extraordinary move, the Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday rescinded its memo suspending payments to domestic federal programs, amid public confusion and upset. The original memo wasn't supposed to affect Medicaid, which helps low-income and disabled people, but some states reported an inability Tuesday to access Medicaid funds.\n\nA federal judge had already temporarily blocked the spending freeze, which the administration had implemented to weed out progressive initiatives, until Feb. 3.\n\nStill, the administration's message is clear: There's a new sheriff in town, and he means business. The fact that Mr. Trump was president before has likely contributed to the abruptness of the changes. This time, allies have said, he and his team know how to make the changes Mr. Trump wants to see. But the rescission of the spending-freeze memo, which followed a White House effort to respond to confusion about the initial memo, raises questions about how much they learned from the experience of 2017.\n\nAnd even the rescission came with confusion: The White House said it was rescinding only the Office of Management and Budget memo, which sparked the court case that led to the temporary block. The funding review remains in effect , spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nAnother element leading to the quick-out-of-the-gate second Trump term took place during the four-year interregnum of President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump's team was hard at work reimagining government, should the former president win the 2024 election.\n\nIn 2022, a conservative think-tank effort known as Project 2025 put out a 900-plus-page proposal to instill conservative policies and expand presidential power in the next conservative administration. Some of the key personnel involved in Project 2025 are now taking positions in the new administration.\n\nIn addition, many of the blueprint's provisions are now being implemented, from eliminating racial equality initiatives in the workplace to rescinding guidance on LGBTQ+ inclusion to withdrawing from international alliances, such as the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accord.\n\nExperts on American government say Mr. Trump's actions fit into a long-term trend toward greater executive authority. In the beginning, the Founding Fathers were wary of monarchical power, but over time, presidents have accrued power, both by aggressively seeking it and as Congress has ceded it.\n\n\"This president is exerting executive authority in ways that would profoundly shock the founders of our republic, who were skeptical of centralized power and executive power especially,\" says Mark Rozell, a presidential scholar at George Mason University in Virginia.\n\nMr. Trump shouldn't think of himself as the CEO of a big company, deciding unilaterally what needs to be done, Professor Rozell adds. And in the current political context, he suggests Mr. Trump may be overreaching.\n\n\"He's acting like he has a huge mandate,\" Mr. Rozell says.\n\nThe reality is that Mr. Trump won a plurality of the vote and does not have the typically high, honeymoon-level popularity of a new president. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Mr. Trump with a 45% approval rating , down 2 points from earlier this month.\n\nBut these are still early days. And the immediate impact of the blizzard of executive actions is still playing out - in some cases, facing litigation that could tie up the orders for months or longer, and could potentially reach the Supreme Court. An order to eliminate birthright citizenship, the constitutional guarantee of U.S. citizenship to most people born on American soil, has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.\n\nAnother Trump initiative might already be backfiring. A mass email that went out Tuesday to federal employees requires a return to office full time and offers buyouts. But it has spurred resistance among some, who say they have no intention of giving in to the president. Mr. Trump had campaigned on going after what he called the \"deep state\" and replacing civil servants with political appointees.\n\nThe emails offer full pay through Sept. 30 if workers resign by Feb. 6, and came with the subject line \"Fork in the Road.\" That's the heading that Trump ally Elon Musk used when he bought Twitter (now known as X) in 2022 and offered severance to reduce the staff. Mr. Musk is head of the Trump advisory commission known as the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who represents a large part of the federal workforce, took to the Senate floor Tuesday and called the buyout offer a \"scam.\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, posted on the social media site X that the buyout offer \"is backed by no funds and no authority.\"\n\nEric Posner, an expert on presidential authority at the University of Chicago Law School, urges caution in judging the flurry of executive actions Mr. Trump has signed since taking office.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\n\"Presidents often issue a lot of dramatic executive orders in the early days of their term,\" Professor Posner says. \"But to really understand whether the president is abusing power, or just using the power he's been given, you have to look at every executive order and see how it holds up.\"\n\nBut with Mr. Trump, he says, there does seem to be a rhetorical goal - to present himself as \"extremely powerful and active.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Many nations have SWFs, which are essentially giant, state-owned investment portfolios.\n\nBut questions about how America would amass resources for such a fund, direct investment decisions, and ensure ethical practices are critical ones. President Trump says an SWF could play an important role in economic development, in public finance, and even in potentially buying TikTok , the social media platform whose U.S. future hangs in the balance.\n\nDoes the idea make sense for the United States?\n\nPresident Donald Trump says he wants America to create a sovereign wealth fund to increase economic security and reduce the deficit. But economists say such a fund might invite corruption. Could the benefits outweigh the risks?\n\nA sovereign wealth fund can help a nation stabilize its economy, build savings, and generate long-term financial returns. Like any investor, a nation can create a portfolio of stocks, bonds, real estate, or other assets and, assuming those investments make money, reap the returns year after year. The portfolio can also be structured to boost economic development, as the White House announced Feb. 3, to \"promote fiscal sustainability, lessen the burden of taxes on American families and small businesses, establish long-term economic security, and promote U.S. economic and strategic leadership internationally.\"\n\nYes, they can, when structured well. Successful funds can pay for national programs without raising taxes. They can buffer against the unexpected or ensure that future generations will have adequate financial resources. Of the more than 90 nations with one or more SWFs, Norway is the star. In 35 years since the SWF's formation, it has invested more than $1.8 trillion of its oil revenues into the fund, and it has reaped another $1.8 trillion in investment returns. \"In a way, we found oil twice: once on the [oil-rich] continental shelf and then again in financial markets,\" quipped Nicolai Tangen, head of the investment firm that manages the fund, in Washington late last year.\n\nThe seed money for these funds comes from excess government revenues. Often, governments (Norway and Saudi Arabia) use the income they make from oil drilling or minerals mining. Others (China) use the money they make from trade surpluses. That's also one reason many analysts pooh-pooh the idea of an American SWF. The U.S. almost always runs annual deficits, not surpluses, and has amassed a mountain of debt.\n\nBut other analysts are more optimistic. The administration says an SWF could be funded by selling off some of the $5.7 trillion the federal government directly holds in land and other assets or the much larger sum of indirect assets, such as natural resource reserves. Last week, the Treasury Department appointed JR Gibbens as a senior adviser for a U.S. SWF. Mr. Gibbens previously worked for the Defense Department's recent effort to attract private capital to invest in areas critical to national defense.\n\nPlenty. A fund can make or lose money, depending on how the individual investments in that fund perform. If the fund managers aren't fully independent, government officials can use the SWF money for their own political ends. If the funds can be invested in domestic assets, such big investments can distort the economy. If the fund managers are not fully transparent about where the money is invested, it can lead to fraud. That's what happened to Malaysia's SWF a decade ago, when allegations of an estimated $4.5 billion siphoned off for lavish spending toppled the then-prime minister, who ended up in prison as a result of the scandal.\n\nMore subtle forms of corruption and cronyism can also emerge. \"If you have government officials with huge investment authority, people are going to want to sway their views,\" says Darrell West , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe idea of an American SWF is generating increasing attention since President Trump suggested it as a vehicle to purchase TikTok , the Chinese social media site.\n\nStarting with some $2 trillion, which could make it the world's largest, an American SWF could (1) support U.S. infrastructure renewal , (2) develop strategic mineral mining in the U.S., and (3) replace corporate taxes and fund startups that would maintain America's technological edge over China.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

His presence comes as the league removes \"End Racism\" slogans, a move some see as aligning with his broader rollback of diversity initiatives.\n\nLoading...\n\nFeb. 09, 2025, 12:02 p.m. ET | WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.\n\nAs a student, Donald Trump played high school football. As a business baron, he owned a team in an upstart rival to the NFL and then sued the established league. As president, he denigrated pros who took a knee during the national anthem as part of a social justice movement.\n\nOn Sunday, he adds to that complicated history with the sport when he becomes the first president in office to attend a Super Bowl.\n\nMr. Trump's appearance at the Superdome in New Orleans to watch the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles follows the NFL's decision to remove the \"End Racism\" slogans that have been stenciled on the end zones since 2021.\n\nMr. Trump recently ordered the cancellation of programs that encourage diversity, equity, and inclusion across the federal government, and some critics see the league's decision as a response to the Republican president's action. But NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league's diversity policies do not conflict with the Trump administration's efforts to end the federal government's DEI programs.\n\nMr. Trump, who attended the Super Bowl in 1992, has avoided choosing sides in Sunday's matchup despite public comments and social media posts that suggest an affinity for Kansas City.\n\nLast week, when asked which team would win, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't want to say, but there's a certain quarterback that seems to be a pretty good winner.\" That appeared to be a reference to the Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes.\n\nMr. Trump also posted congratulations to the Chiefs in January after they won the AFC Championship.\n\nThe president played football as a student at the New York Military Academy. As a New York businessman in the early 1980s, he owned the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Mr. Trump had sued to force a merger of the USFL and the NFL. The USFL eventually folded.\n\nFriction existed between Mr. Trump and the NFL during his first term as president.\n\nMr. Trump took issue with players kneeling during the national anthem to protest social or racial injustice. That movement began in 2016 with then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" during an exhibition game in Denver.\n\nMr. Trump, through social media and other public comments, insisted that players stand for the national anthem, and he called on team owners to fire any player who took a knee.\n\n\"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, you'd say, 'Get that son of a ***** off the field right now. Out! He's fired,\" Mr. Trump said to loud applause at a rally in Hunstville, Alabama, in 2017.\n\nMr. Trump is expected to watch the game from a box in the company of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., among others. Mr. Trump won Missouri and Pennsylvania - the states represented in the game - on his way to a second term in November.\n\nHis interest in sports extends beyond football. Mr. Trump is an avid golfer who owns multiple golf courses and has hosted tournaments. He sponsored boxing matches at his former casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and attended a UFC match at Madison Square Garden weeks after winning a second term.\n\nMr. Trump was playing golf with Tiger Woods on Sunday morning in Florida, where the president spent the weekend, the White House said.\n\nSome NFL team owners have donated to his campaigns, and Mr. Trump maintains friendships with Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie, who played for the Generals. Mr. Trump endorsed Walker's unsuccessful bid as the Republican candidate for a U.S. Senate seat from Georgia in 2022, and has tapped him to become ambassador to the Bahamas.\n\nMr. Trump signed an order last week that is intended to block transgender women and girls from competing in women's sports by targeting federal funding for schools that fail to comply.\n\nAlvin Tillery, a politics professor and diversity expert at Northwestern University, said in an interview that the NFL's decision to remove \"End Racism\" slogans was \"shameful\" given that the league \"makes tens of billions of dollars largely on the bodies of Black men.\"\n\nHe said the NFL should explain who it was aiming to please. The NFL said it was stenciling \"Choose Love\" in one of the end zones for the Super Bowl to encourage the country after a series of tragedies so far this year, including a New Year's Day truck attack in the host city of New Orleans that killed 14 people and injured dozens more.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Aides hovered around them; one shined the light of his cellphone on documents the two leaders were reviewing. A Mar-a-Lago Club member sitting nearby snapped pictures and posted them on Facebook .\n\n\"Wow.....,\" Richard DeAgazio wrote, \"the center of the action!!!\"\n\nThe Mar-a-Lago terrace had, in effect, become an open-air White House Situation Room, but without the high-level security of the West Wing basement room where the president and top aides usually meet to address world crises. At that moment, just 24 days into Trump's presidency, some Americans' fears of having a novice to government serving in the top job crystallized.\n\nWould Trump accidentally reveal classified information in public? Would he respond prudently to North Korea's provocation? Was he really ready to do the job he had won, defying expectations, just a few months earlier?\n\nA year into Trump's presidency, North Korea remains a top security threat - and Trump's freewheeling, norm-busting approach to the presidency is the new normal. The dizzying turnover of top staff and breathless media reports of palace intrigue - as evidenced by the recent brouhaha over the new tell-all book on Trump's first year, \"Fire and Fury\" - have only enhanced the sense of reality-TV-style drama. So has the investigation into possible Russian collaboration with Trump associates in the 2016 campaign. Ditto the women accusing Trump of past sexual misdeeds.\n\nThe explosions around \"Fire and Fury\" are only the latest disruptions - from former top Trump aide Steve Bannon's reported assertion of \"treasonous\" behavior by Trump family members, to Trump's break with Mr. Bannon and threats of legal action against him.\n\nIn countless other ways, from his provocative use of Twitter to his aggressive use of executive power to his attacks on the news media, Trump has disrupted American life, the American presidency, American politics, and America's place in the world.\n\n\"As Winston Churchill once said of an American cabinet member, 'He's a bull who carries his own china shop with him,' \" says Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.\n\nTo Trump supporters, that's exactly the point: They voted for someone who would \"fight back\" and shake up a Washington power structure - \"the swamp\" - that they believe stopped serving the people a long time ago. And they say he is delivering. Trump's war on government regulation has rolled back scores of policies on the environment, education, law enforcement, energy, and the internet.\n\nTo critics, Trump represents the sum of all fears: a populist demagogue who preys on voter anger, stokes racism, enacts self-enriching policies, and fans the flames of class division and partisan polarization that have been growing for decades. Some House Democrats are already pushing for impeachment, and held a symbolic vote in December , despite opposition from Democratic leaders.\n\nIn truth, the Trump disruption so far hasn't proved to be as, well, disruptive as it could have been. Trump is not a dictator - far from it. Respect for the Constitution remains deeply embedded in the American psyche. The two-party system remains vibrant, as seen last month in Doug Jones's stunning upset in the Alabama special Senate election - a rare Democratic victory in a deeply Republican state.\n\n\"It looks so far like our system is more resilient than a lot of people thought it was,\" says Gene Healy, vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute and author of the book \"The Cult of the Presidency: America's Dangerous Devotion to Executive Power.\" \"The courts and to some extent Congress have pushed back.\"\n\nIn July 2016, Trump presented himself at the Republican National Convention as a savior who could solve the nation's ills all on his own, from poverty and violence at home to war and destruction abroad.\n\n\"I alone can fix it,\" he boomed.\n\nTrump's grand rhetoric brought conventiongoers to their feet, and on the political left, sowed fears of an authoritarian-in-the-making. One year into his tenure, experts on presidential power see a man who has, in some ways, pulled the levers of power with singular abandon - both formally and informally - even as he discovers the limits of that authority.\n\n\"It's a fascinating case study,\" says Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University in Washington. \"As controversial as many of the statements and actions of President Trump are, he has not pushed the envelope of executive privilege as much as President Obama did during his presidency.\"\n\nIndeed, Trump's use of executive power so far has centered on undoing Barack Obama's legacy, many elements of which Obama had bypassed Congress to carry out. Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and the Paris climate accord, decertified the Iran nuclear pact, and in perhaps his most explosive decision, announced the end of DACA - Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects some 800,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation.\n\nObama himself foresaw the risk of relying on executive authority - and even warned President-elect Trump to be careful about going down that path.\n\n\"Going through the legislative process is always better, in part because it's harder to undo,\" Obama told NPR a month before leaving office.\n\nIt wasn't until the third year of Obama's presidency, after the Democrats had lost control of the House, that he began to rely on executive power to enact major policy shifts. So comparing one year of Trump with eight years of Obama isn't quite fair.\n\nTrump, like Obama, began his presidency with both houses of Congress under his party's control, and so going the legislative route to enact major policy change made sense. Besides, matters involving the federal budget and taxation must go through Congress. Initially, Trump struggled to learn the art of the legislative deal - failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare,\" before passing tax reform. It was the only major piece of legislation he got through Congress in his first year.\n\nThe true test of Trump's approach to executive power may come a year from now - after the November 2018 midterm elections - if the Republicans lose control of one or both houses of Congress.\n\n\"If one of the houses does flip, there will be a lot of pressure on Trump to act as Obama did in the face of legislative opposition,\" says Mr. Turley.\n\nAnd if Trump does move toward more aggressive use of executive authority, he will be following a certain tradition. Obama was dubbed an \"imperial president,\" just as he had accused his predecessor, George W. Bush, of being. Presidents Richard Nixon, Harry Truman, and Franklin Roosevelt were all parties to landmark Supreme Court cases challenging their aggressive uses of executive power.\n\nA larger question may be whether Congress can find its way back to its rightful place as a vehicle for bipartisanship and compromise. Scholars on the left and right speak of how polarization and other factors have made the legislative branch increasingly dysfunctional.\n\n\"I think the greatest challenge facing the Trump administration - or actually, any administration - these days is that Congress is broken,\" says Daniel Bonevac, a philosophy professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He blames budgeting procedures put in place after Watergate that had the unintentional effect of making compromise more difficult.\n\n\"I don't think President Trump is responsible, in short, for the change in norms,\" says Mr. Bonevac. \"I think he's a response to the change in norms.\"\n\nIn his inaugural address, on Jan. 20, 2017, Trump painted a bleak picture of \"forgotten men and women\" and \"American carnage.\"\n\n\"Now arrives the hour of action,\" the new president pledged.\n\nA week later, Trump announced a \"travel ban,\" temporarily barring entry into the US by nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries. It was Trump's first major executive order, and it suggested that the billionaire businessman used to issuing commands and seeing them carried out would try the same approach from the Oval Office.\n\nThe checks and balances limiting the power of American presidents, as enshrined in the Constitution, were in for a test.\n\nThe answer came quickly. Within days, amid protests at American airports, a federal judge blocked the measure nationwide. Legal experts slammed the order as sloppily drafted. Trump responded with decidedly unpresidential rhetoric, lashing out on Twitter at \"this so-called judge\" - an echo of his 2015 slur against the Mexican-American judge handling the lawsuit against Trump University.\n\nBut the government agencies implementing the ban backed down, following the judge's order. A revised travel ban was also blocked, and in December, the Supreme Court allowed a third version to proceed in full while lower courts review the merits.\n\nThat decision suggests the Supreme Court could uphold the ban, in keeping with the principle that presidents have broad authority to control who may enter the country. And so, in the end, Trump may well prove victorious on this issue. But the path to fulfillment has been bumpy.\n\nDespite Trump's desire to present himself as the biggest and the best, his use of executive orders has not been unusual. Obama issued an average of 35 per year, President Ronald Reagan 47, and President Jimmy Carter 80. Trump is on track to issue 59 in his first year (he had signed 55 through the end of 2017). But it's not about numbers; it's about what the orders do.\n\nMost journalists covering the White House have the same routine: Wake up, grab phone, check @realDonaldTrump to see what's on POTUS's mind.\n\nTrump's early-morning tweets can set the day's agenda. At times, they merely let people know what he was watching that morning - often Fox News. They can be witty or pungent, controversial or straightforward. Some contain falsehoods.\n\nSometimes Trump's tweets push the bounds of good taste, as when he called North Korean President Kim Jong-un \"short and fat.\" But over the course of a day, Trump's Twitter feed is rarely dull. And it is arguably the most revolutionary aspect of his presidency. With this simple tool, Trump has changed the tone of an office that is usually dignified, often a force for national unity, and turned it on its head. Internationally, Trump tweets have stoked diplomatic riffs. In the US, political polarization has deepened.\n\nBut Twitter is Trump's way of communicating directly with his base, and his supporters appreciate that.\n\n\"I follow him because I want to see what he's saying myself and not have someone interpret it for me,\" says Annie Anthony, a 50-something Trump voter who runs a volunteer center in Wilmington, N.C.\n\nBut she calls Trump's language \"unprofessional\" - a common complaint, even among Trump supporters. \"He uses words like 'sad' and 'bad.' That's first-grade language,\" says Ms. Anthony, speaking at a recent focus group organized by pollster Peter Hart. \"We're an intelligent population who elected you. Represent us!\"\n\nTrump's Twitter feed, in fact, isn't just about the president and his phone. It's an entire enterprise, with input from social media director Dan Scavino and other advisers.\n\nA Trump White House insider identifies three types of Trump tweets. \"There's one kind where he's sitting there at 5 in the morning in his pajamas, tweeting,\" he says. \"These are the kinds of things that make his staff scream into pillows.\"\n\nThe next kind of tweet involves Trump saying, \"Hey, Dan, get in here,\" referring to Mr. Scavino. Trump says what he wants tweeted, then Scavino composes the words and puts it out. \"I've been in the Oval Office and seen this,\" says the source.\n\nThen there's the third kind of tweet that never crosses Trump's desk. Most are anodyne, and come from senior aides - Stephen Miller, Jared Kushner, the White House counsel's office, says the Trump insider. Occasionally, there are slip-ups - such as the recent tweet about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn that called into question what Trump knew when he fired him. Trump lawyer John Dowd took the blame for composing that tweet.\n\n\"I think that was one of these categories where Trump really never saw the darn thing,\" says the Trump insider.\n\nPresidential historians are struck, perhaps above all else, by how Trump's use of Twitter has shaped his presidency. \"Imagine if Franklin Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy had had a hot mic in the Oval Office, and that every time they had a thought, it would go out over the airwaves,\" says Ms. Perry of the University of Virginia.\n\nShe notes that Roosevelt did just 30 radio \"fireside chats\" over 12 years, and President Kennedy held an average of two TV news conferences a month.\n\n\"They had a sense that they didn't want to be overexposed,\" says Perry. \"Now, it's fascinating there's someone in the Oval who doesn't worry about overexposure.\"\n\nPresidential scholar Matthew Dickinson says that beneath all the \"surface churning,\" it's too soon to say if the Trump presidency has brought more fundamental shifts in the relative power of the president vis-à-vis Congress and the courts.\n\n\"But I do see a president who has transformed our expectations on a daily basis about what a president can do in social media, in public relations,\" says Mr. Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College in Vermont.\n\nEver the showman, Trump had props ready when he walked into the White House's Roosevelt Room on Dec. 14 to talk deregulation: piles of paper representing regulations in 1960 (20,000 pages, he said) and today (185,000 pages, standing 6 feet tall).\n\nA big red ribbon stretched across the higher pile, and with oversized scissors, Trump cut through the \"red tape\" - a bit of theater meant to symbolize his aggressive efforts to roll back regulations.\n\n\"We're just getting started,\" Trump said, speaking of a major deregulation effort that goes to one of his campaign mantras: \"Drain the swamp.\"\n\nIn Trump's lexicon, the term \"swamp\" can be interpreted broadly - the party \"establishments,\" the lawyers, the lobbyists, the media, and the bureaucrats of \"permanent Washington\" who hinder economic growth, he says, with needless rules and regulations.\n\nTrump has spent his short political career trying to lay waste to all those forces. Many key positions at government agencies remain unfilled , some even lacking a nominee. This may seem to be a swamp-draining exercise, though it also hinders Trump's ability to carry out his policies.\n\nOn the regulatory front, Trump's first year has been momentous - and highly controversial. In January, one of his first executive orders required that two regulations be eliminated for every new one. By December, Trump claimed a ratio of 22 to 1, including two eliminated through congressional action that reportedly saved the government more than $480 million.\n\nThe Treasury Department has targeted some 90 banking and financial regulations. The Department of Education has rescinded Obama-era rules on sexual assault on campus and regulations on for-profit colleges. \"Net neutrality\" - the principle of equal access to internet content - is gone.\n\nBut the poster child of Trump-era deregulation has to be Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environment Protection Agency. Among the scores of actions taken, Mr. Pruitt's EPA has moved to rescind Obama's Clean Power Plan, aimed at combating global warming; eliminated rules blocking construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines; and moved to open up off-shore drilling in most US waters, including areas currently protected.\n\n\"Like it or not, [deregulation] seems to be one area where he's doing what he said he would do,\" says Susan Dudley, director of the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center.\n\nMany business leaders believe Trump's deregulation effort has fueled the booming stock market. True or not, it has at least forced a rebalancing of power in Washington. \"The bureaucracy, scarcely mentioned in the Constitution, is a huge branch of government now,\" says Dickinson. \"It's not the sexiest topic, but increasingly it's where the action is. It's where all these competing powers are vying for influence.\"\n\nTrump's attention to the \"administrative state\" is a welcome development, at least from a constitutional standpoint, says Turley. \"I don't happen to agree with his priorities; for one thing I'm sort of a tree-hugger,\" says Turley. \"But there was a need to rebalance power, particularly between Congress and the agencies. We're seeing a real effort now in Congress to find ways of reinforcing congressional oversight.\"\n\nSoon after taking office, top aides to Trump and the congressional leadership met to deploy a little-used law called the Congressional Review Act to eliminate Obama's final regulatory actions. In all, 14 regulations were overturned in short order.\n\nIt was a quiet but significant effort - and a reminder that Congress, as a co-equal branch of government, has more power than it often chooses to use. And it enabled Trump to add to his tally of promises kept.\n\nPrototypes for Trump's promised wall on the US-Mexican border went up in October. His \"travel ban\" is in effect. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, bucking decades of US policy and sparking an uproar. He took action against \"sanctuary cities,\" though a federal judge blocked the order. He passed the first major tax reform in 30 years.\n\nThough Trump failed to repeal Obamacare, he used tax reform to kill off a key component - the individual mandate to buy health insurance. A record number of appeals court judges were confirmed in Trump's first year, as was conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\n\"Probably more than any president in my lifetime, he's kept his promises,\" says Turley.\n\nThis, despite the dark shadow hanging over the Trump presidency from the start - the Russia investigation, led by special counsel Robert Mueller since May. Inside the White House, there's no doubt the probe has been a distraction, especially after the indictments and plea deals of former Trump advisers. But checking off agenda items has been a salve.\n\nThe jury is out on whether Trump is governing as a populist. Big tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans belie that label. And his promises of reduced engagement abroad have yet to materialize.\n\nBut through it all, Trump has held onto his core supporters - albeit with historically low job approval for a first-year president, at 39 percent on average through the end of 2017, according to Gallup.\n\nStill firmly in his camp are the Trumpettes, a group of wealthy women who began pushing Trump to run for president back in 2015. On Jan. 18, 2018, at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., they will host a $300-a-ticket bash to celebrate his first year in office.\n\nFor Trump, the Jan. 20 anniversary will be a chance to tout accomplishments, and for Democrats, a day to redouble their resolve to fight - and look forward to the November midterms. Both the House and even the Senate are \"in play,\" analysts say, especially after the Democratic sweep in Virginia and New Jersey last November, and Senator Jones's improbable victory last month in Alabama. Women are turning out to vote and running for office in large numbers, ready to do battle against the Trump agenda. A big blue wave appears to be forming.\n\nTrump himself plans to campaign heavily for Republicans ahead of the midterms, to which Democrats say, \"Bring it on.\" A high-profile Trump is their best motivator.\n\nThe top legislative agenda items for 2018 are welfare reform and infrastructure. But with the Republican majority in the Senate now down to 51-49, passing anything significant will be that much more difficult - particularly if Trump loses either house of Congress in the midterms. \"On the homefront, there's been a lot of bluster, though I think he's learning that the government domestically doesn't run like a reality show or a business,\" says Mr. Healy of the Cato Institute. But overseas, he adds, \"the executive branch seems as unrestrained as ever.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In November, fears over whether Trump can be trusted with US nuclear weapons - whose use he can authorize on his own - spurred the first hearings in Congress in 41 years to examine who should control the arsenal.\n\nNo further action has been taken, though on another matter - Trump's ability to remove economic sanctions against Russia - Congress did vote to constrain the president. The larger questions over how Trump handles the powers of the presidency, both formal and informal, hang in the balance. The Trump Show, Year 2, has just begun.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Mr. Trump is just the latest political candidate to clash with a musician about song rights and intentions.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated June 17, 2015, 10:03 p.m. ET\n\nLess than a day after launching his presidential campaign, Donald Trump may already be hitting the wrong notes.\n\nMr. Trump announced his candidacy Tuesday to the sound of Neil Young's 1989 hit \"Rockin' in the Free World,\" but Trump had no permission to use the song, said Elliot Roberts, Mr. Young's manager. The incident makes the real estate tycoon the latest candidate to butt heads with a musician about song copyright in a campaign.\n\n\"Donald Trump was not authorized to use 'Rockin' in the Free World,' \" Mr. Roberts said in a statement. \"Neil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of [US senator and Democratic candidate] Bernie Sanders for president of the United States of America.\"\n\nA campaign spokesperson said that Trump, a fan of Young's music despite their differing views, used the song legally through a licensing deal with the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), a performance rights group, Rolling Stone reported .\n\nBut ASCAP noted that in some cases, using a song for political purposes requires a campaign to reach out to the song's publisher and the artist's record label.\n\n\"The laws are complicated,\" The Washington Post's Emily Heil wrote . \"It may be okay to use a song in one setting, like a convention center, but taboo in another. How much of the song they use also could be an issue.\"\n\nAnd even when a campaign does get copyright permission, artists can still object to the use of their music under other laws that protect their brand or image, or ban implications of endorsement.\n\nIn this, Trump joins a string of politicians whose unauthorized song use has led to awkward headlines and, in some cases, legal action.\n\nFormer president George W. Bush used Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down\" during public appearances for his 2000 campaign - until the musician's publisher sent a cease and desist order that said the use of the song implied an endorsement that Mr. Petty would not give, Time reported .\n\nIn 2008, the rock duo Heart complained about the John McCain/Sarah Palin campaign's use of their 1977 classic, \"Barracuda,\" telling Entertainment Weekly that the song was written as a \"scathing rant against the soulless, corporate nature of the music business, particularly for women.... [T]here's irony in Republican strategists' choice to make use of it.\"\n\nDuring that same campaign, musician John Mellencamp asked Mr. McCain to stop using his songs, \"Our Country\" and \"Pink House,\" instead joining Democratic candidate John Edwards at one of his rallies.\n\nIn 2011, Tom Petty again sent a cease and desist letter , this time to former Minnesota representative Michele Bachmann, for her use of his 1977 hit, \"American Girl,\" at a presidential campaign rally.\n\nIn their 2012 campaigns, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich also had to stop using \"Eye of the Tiger\" by Survivor and \"Wavin' Flag\" by Somali-Canadian musician K'naan after the artists raised copyright issues, The New York Times reported .\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nThe list goes on, and in most cases the musicians involved were as upset about the message their songs were made to send as about unlawful use.\n\n\"I got a flood of Twitter messages from people who assumed that it was all true, that I was now a supporter of Mitt Romney's campaign,\" K'naan told the Times. \"I'm for immigrants. I'm for poor people, and they don't seem to be what he's endorsing. My song being his victory song didn't seem quite right.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

His views are pretty unorthodox.\n\nLoading...\n\nApril 01, 2011, 5:50 p.m. ET\n\nDonald Trump says he will decide by June whether to run for president . In the meantime, he's been bestriding US cable news like a colossus, reminding everyone that he is a \"tough guy\" who went to \"the best schools\" and still has a \"great, big, fat, beautiful heart.\"\n\n\"We have a moral obligation to help people. I really believe that. I believe that strongly, and not everybody does,\" Mr. Trump said on \"The O'Reilly Factor \" earlier this week.\n\nWe've written previously about Trump's embrace of the notion that President Obama might not have been born in America, so we won't belabor that here. During his O'Reilly appearance, Trump implied that announcements of Mr. Obama's birth, which appeared in Hawaiian newspapers, could have been retroactively faked.\n\nRELATED: The Top 10 political quotes of 2010\n\nHost Bill O'Reilly was having none of that. Mr. O'Reilly said he'd looked into the whole matter and didn't believe in so-called birther assertions that Obama was born overseas.\n\n\"I don't think you believe that either. I think it's provocative; you get a lot of attention raising the question,\" O'Reilly said.\n\nFine. But the subject today is foreign policy. Specifically, what would a President Trump do to push US interests around the world?\n\nHe's talked a lot about that this week, and his views are pretty unorthodox. For instance, on Iraq , Trump said that the United States should not pull out troops. Oh no. The US should stay in Iraq (since, he says, Iran will swoop in the moment we leave) and seize Iraqi oil fields, so as to turn the whole invasion thing into a paying venture.\n\n\"We pay ourself back $1.5 trillion or more. We take care of Britain , we take care of other countries that helped us,\" said Trump.\n\nHmm. Wouldn't the Iraqis ... object? Wouldn't all the factions in the country then unite and turn US-supplied weapons on their erstwhile ally in an insurgency that would make the bad old days look peaceful?\n\nTrump also repeated his previous vow that if elected, he would slap a 25 percent tariff on all Chinese-made goods so that they would stop manipulating their currency and unfairly stealing American jobs.\n\nTrump insists that just a whiff of such an approach would cause the Chinese to behave. But we've got a couple of economic questions on this one. What if Beijing didn't bother to do anything? Everything in Wal-Mart would suddenly be 25 percent more expensive, right?\n\nAnd if China did revalue its currency the way Trump wants, wouldn't it make Chinese goods more costly so they don't undercut US-made ones? So again, prices go up.\n\nAmericans have gotten kind of used to their inexpensive Asian-supplied stuff, we'll point out. It's not clear whether a tariff would bring back any US jobs, but it's pretty clear that voters might be angry about that big whack to their wallets.\n\nOK. What about Iran? They might get nuclear weapons during a Trump presidency, O'Reilly noted. How would chief executive Trump prevent that from happening?\n\n\"I would do what I had to do.... They would not have a nuke,\" Trump said flatly.\n\nWe'll note that Presidents Bush and Obama both have tried to sound just as ominous when talking about their Iranian options, and yet those Iranian centrifuges keep spinning, producing fissile material. Except when they're offline due to the Stuxnet computer worm, which so far looks like the best weapon the rest of the world has against the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nWhat's the bottom line here? O'Reilly, for one, did not sound impressed with Trump's foreign policy.\n\n\"Can you imagine the world reaction to that?\" O'Reilly said Friday on \"Fox & Friends,\" in regard to the Trump proposal to seize Iraq's oil fields.\n\nNo, but we can imagine how great a reality show \"Celebrity Foreign Policy Apprentice\" would be. Each week, famous folks vie to carry out a diplomatic task assigned by a tough, wisecracking boss renowned for accomplishment in the field.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton .\n\nRELATED: The Top 10 political quotes of 2010\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Ted Cruz, who said Trump was \"terrific\"and that he should not apologize because he \"speaks the truth.\" And Iowa Rep. Steve King, who told KAYL Radio in Storm Lake, Iowa, \"Donald Trump is one of the few individuals that will speak boldly about what he believes in, and he'll be challenged by the P.C. police, the politically correct police, and instead of backing up and curling up, he just goes forward.\"\n\nAnd then there are the debates.\n\nBecause of his name recognition, Trump will likely poll well enough to qualify for the debates, which means he'll knock off someone more serious who could use the platform to discuss real problems that affect the country - like Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\n\nAnd of course, some have suggested Trump's entry would turn the debates into a reality show.\n\nDemocrats, of course, are watching with glee.\n\n\"I am a person of faith - and the Donald's entry into this race can only be attributed to the fact that the good Lord is a Democrat with a sense of humor,\" Paul Begala, veteran Democratic strategist and adviser to Priorities USA Action, a super PAC boosting Clinton's candidacy, told The Washington Post.\n\nThey're also actively working to tar the rest of the Republican party with Trump's views, with Clinton calling his comments \"emblematic,\" and at least one Democratic super PAC suggesting he's the new face of the GOP.\n\n\"Donald Trump is suddenly a force to be reckoned with in the G.O.P. primary, proving their rebrand is going splendidly,\" Jessica Mackler, president of American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC, told the Times . \"He's a great example of everything Republicans stand for.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nStill, Republicans fretful that Trump will make a mockery of their field have reason to hope: With his trademark brand of brash, outrageous, braggadocio, Trump makes real politicians look good.\n\n\"He's a living, breathing Sister Souljah moment waiting to make the other nine Republicans look statesmanlike and tactful in comparison,\" writes managing editor Robert Schlesinger for US News & World Report. \"He's a funhouse mirror caricature of the GOP (rich, white, bombastic, bigoted) which gives the actual candidates on the platform a foil off of whom they can score moderating points while still being as conservative as they (and the base) want to be.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Yet in other ways, he is behaving as a conventional Republican, which is consolidating the party behind him.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Dec. 08, 2016, 2:05 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nIn many ways, the Trump presidency began the day he won the election - and in just three weeks, Donald Trump has already brought bracing change to the institution.\n\nHe tweets with abandon, going over the heads of the mainstream media and straight to his public; and he says he'll keep doing so after taking office. He has conducted his Cabinet search out in the open, like a casting call for \"The Apprentice,\" as applicants (and well-wishers) come and go through the lobby of Trump Tower. And he will keep having big rallies, starting Thursday in Cincinnati, as he launches a \"thank you\" tour of battleground states.\n\nAt the same time, Trump is also behaving as a conventional Republican. He has named GOP establishment figures to top posts - starting with national party chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, and continuing with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as United Nations ambassador, Georgia Rep. Tom Price as Health and Human Services secretary, and former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao as Transportation secretary.\n\nIn so doing, Trump has reassured GOP regulars and consolidated the party behind him. Trump's conventional early Cabinet picks took on added significance following two controversial appointments: Breitbart News executive Steve Bannon as chief strategist and Michael Flynn as national security adviser .\n\nBut Trump's maverick, populist side remains supremely important: It helps keep his voters with him, including disaffected, working-class Democrats and first-time voters inspired by Trump's promise to \"make America great again.\" The election of 2016 was a cry for change, and just by winning, the billionaire businessman/political novice has broken the mold. Now he's showing what change can look like.\n\nPerhaps most eye-popping was the news Tuesday night that the incoming Trump administration had struck a deal to keep nearly 1,000 jobs with the Carrier air conditioning company in Indiana. Carrier had planned to move 1,400 jobs to Mexico, a topic that Trump had pounded relentlessly during the campaign.\n\nMany questions remain over the deal, which involved concessions to Carrier reportedly arranged by Trump and the incoming vice president, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. But at first blush - and certainly for the workers involved - the Carrier news was a stunning piece of good news.\n\n\"Great deal for workers. @realDonaldTrump & @mike_pence already putting American jobs first,\" Mr. Priebus tweeted early Wednesday morning.\n\nTrump also made headlines Wednesday with his announcement, via Twitter, that he and his adult children will hold a press conference Dec. 15 to address concerns about conflicts of interest between Trump Organization business dealings and Trump's role as president.\n\n\"While I am not mandated to do this under the law, I feel it is visually important , as President, to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses,\" Trump tweeted .\n\nHe promised to leave the Trump Organization \"in total,\" and said that, at the press conference, he would reveal legal documents that remove him from the business operations of his companies. Trump had said during the campaign that his children would take over his businesses if he won the presidency.\n\nTrump's profile as a high-flying businessman, in and of itself, makes him unique as an incoming president. And questions about conflict of interest, almost regardless of what is announced on Dec. 15, are certain to dog him during his time in office.\n\nBut it is Trump's populist flair for capturing and holding attention that promises to make his presidency a daily adventure. Whether it's his tweets or his travels or the daily reality show of his decision-making process, the public can't look away.\n\n\"In the days when President-elect John Kennedy met prospective Cabinet members at his Georgetown home and President-elect Richard Nixon was vetting his Cabinet at the Pierre Hotel in N.Y., the process was secretive,\" writes John Gizzi, chief political columnist at Newsmax, in an email. \"Runners-up and near-secretaries of something were revealed only years later.\"\n\nToday, Mr. Gizzi says, Trump has brought \"an unusually bright ray of transparency\" into the process. \"We now get to see Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, and Sen. Bob Corker coming and going from Trump Tower, vying for secretary of State as if they were finalists in a Trump-managed beauty pageant.\"\n\nGizzi compares Trump's ground-breaking use of Twitter to President Franklin Roosevelt's fireside radio chats that reached millions of Americans directly, avoiding the filter of traditional news media.\n\n\"In some ways, Trump is an FDR of the 21st century - a mass communicator who uses new tools to hold enemies accountable,\" Gizzi writes. \"And, like Roosevelt in 1938, when he held rallies to try to purge conservative enemies from the Democratic Party, a President Trump will continue to hold rallies highlighting his version of things. Watch for some big shows as Congress tries to repeal Obamacare.\"\n\nPerhaps most extraordinary in Trump's early days as president-elect is how he has so quickly consolidated the Republican Party behind him. That even a \"never-Trumper\" like former Governor Romney of Massachusetts would consider becoming Trump's secretary of State is telling.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

That is the argument, made most thoroughly by the book of that title , that party leaders act in effect as gatekeepers who control who wins their party's nomination. They do so through a variety of signaling mechanisms, such as endorsements, or by steering financial contributions, that collectively help winnow the candidate field and, ideally, focus voter support behind a single candidate - preferably one who shares the party's dominant ideological perspective and can still win the general election. Moreover, much of that winnowing takes place prior to any actual voting for party delegates, as party leaders work behind the scenes to eliminate unwanted candidates as soon as possible.\n\nMy skepticism rests on three essential points. First, the authors use what I consider to be a rather generous definition of \"party,\" or intense policy demanders. This allows them to claim that, for the most part, party leaders have retained control of the nominating process despite ostensibly significant changes in how delegates are selected, as in the movement from a convention-centered nominating process to the current post-McGovern-Fraser emphasis on caucus and primaries. (By the way, the book does a wonderful job providing an historical overview of the evolution of the presidential nominating process, which is an important reason why I continue to assign it in my elections class.) A second concern - and perhaps an unfair one - is the difficulty the authors have in showing how this coordinating process actually takes place. As far as I can tell, there's no smoking memo where party leaders confirm which candidates they will support. So one must infer the existence of a party-driven winnowing process.\n\nOf course, as I tell my students, when it comes to explaining political behavior, you don't beat something with nothing. If the party isn't deciding, then who is? My sense is that at least since the McGovern-Fraser reforms, it is more typically the voters who decide - at least those voters who participate in the series of caucuses and primaries that constitute the modern nominating process.  Admittedly, they are not generally representative of the broader public but neither are they the equivalent, at least from my perspective, of the traditional \"party bosses\" who used to control blocs of delegates. However, voters aren't free to choose just any candidate.  Instead, they choose from a candidate menu that is heavily influenced by the media's perception of which candidates are truly viable. The media does not do well with candidate complexity, and so it moves early to simplify the narrative by classifying candidates based on expected strength.  For example, think of the segmentation of the Republican debate participants by the various cable networks into a \"grown up\" and \"kiddie table.\" Under this alternative scenario, party elites don't decide so much as they anticipate who the likely nominee will be based on their read of the political landscape and potential candidates. When the indicators all point in the direction of a particular candidate, party leaders endorse early, in order to position themselves for any benefits that may accrue from being among the first to jump on the winning candidate's bandwagon. But when the crystal ball is a bit foggier, they wait to endorse, heeding the famous adage to \"don't back no losers.\" It is precisely that uncertainty, I believe, that has caused many Republican leaders to hold back on endorsing anyone during the current election cycle. It is not, as some political scientists claim, that they have simply decided not to endorse - it is that they don't know who to endorse.\n\nOf course, one can't possibly do full justice in a blog post to the Party Decides thesis, which rests on a slew of data and careful analysis - you really should read the book and decide for yourself. For what it is worth, most of my students who have experience working on campaigns seem not to buy the argument.  However, I haven't presented any evidence indicating that my alternative take is more plausible (although my students and I are working on it!)\n\n\"But what about Donald Trump?\" you may ask. With his commanding victory yesterday in Nevada, Trump has now won three of the four Republican nominating contests to date.  Moreover, despite not having the support of the Republican Party (at least not by the usual indicators) he seems to be gaining strength and appears poised to do quite well on Super Tuesday.  Doesn't he disprove the Party Decides thesis.\n\nPerhaps.  But I'm in no position to make that case! I often tell my students that in contrast to the general election, political scientists have a more difficult time predicting the outcome of the nominating process - there are too many candidates and decision points, and the party label doesn't serve as a useful decision cue. But this year I made it quite clear that I was certain about one thing: Donald Trump would not win the Republican nomination. Indeed, on the day he made his announcement that he was running, I wrote what I believed to be a very clever and amusing tongue-firmly-in-cheek post explaining why I was breaking my long tradition of not voting in presidential elections in order to cast my ballot for The Donald.  Alas, it was too clever by half and, at this point, the laugh is on me. Make no mistake about it: Donald Trump is clearly the front-runner for the Republican nomination. I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nNote that I disagree with my colleagues who claim the Republican Party has implicitly allowed him to take the lead. I just think they don't have any tools to stop him. He clearly doesn't need their endorsements to win - I think one member of Congress has endorsed him so far although, if my theory is correct I expect more members to get on the Trump bandwagon. Nor does he need party funding. Indeed, he has proved a master at getting free publicity and he has spent comparatively little on advertising. Leading party members and fellow candidates - most notably Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and poor Jeb! Bush - have openly criticized him. But it seems to have no effect - instead, Trump uses that opposition as a selling point to his followers, as I've seen firsthand at his rallies.\n\nAnd it is those rallies that, to me, hold the key to understanding Trump's success. I've described them elsewhere ,  but a couple of points are worth highlighting. First, it is commonplace to describe Trump's followers as \"angry.\" But his rallies are anything but an expression of anger - in fact, audience members seem to take particular delight in hearing Trump explain how he will make America Great Again. These are festive events, replete with vendors hawking Trump memorabilia, musicians playing, and crowd members chatting excitedly despite lengthy lines and often inclement weather.  Audiences even participate at key moments, as when Trump asks \"Who is going to pay for the wall?\" and they scream out in unison \"Mexico!\" The second point is that Trump does not talk down to his audience - instead, he takes their views seriously, and by expressing those views in plain, often politically-incorrect (and admittedly superficial) talking points, he appears to validate them. Yes, part of his support is driven by economic discontent - for many middle and lower-income Americans, wages have been stagnant for some time, manufacturing jobs have disappeared, and the future holds little promise of improvement. But he is winning across all income groups, although his support is  stronger among lower- and middle-income voters.\n\nIn addition to his policy stances, then, part of his appeal is that he appears to be on his audience's side - he doesn't try to excuse or explain their beliefs as an illustration of intolerance or bigotry. Instead, he says they are right to hold those beliefs, and if elected president he is going to act on them. At the same time he doesn't pretend to be one of them. Instead, he flaunts his wealth, his education, his beautiful wife and his \"New York values\" lifestyle. In so doing, he comes across as authentic. But he also says, \"See - I've made it. Don't you want to make it too?\" They understand that Trump doesn't have to be doing this - he tells them as much in his standard stump speech - but that he really does want to make America, and by extension, his audience, great again. And they really believe he will - or at least they are willing to take that chance. After all, what do they have to lose?\n\nYes, we need to be careful in overstating the extent of Trump's support - but it appears to be growing, despite high unfavorable ratings. And it is not immediately clear who the alternative candidate will be. Despite repeated media attempts to prop him up, Marco Rubio hasn't come close to challenging Trump since his overhyped third-place finish in Iowa. Ted Cruz has a solid core of conservative followers, but he's shown little ability to expand beyond that base. Maybe John Kasich will take off, but so far his brand of sunny optimism and social conservatism hasn't caught on, despite a strong resume. And Ben Carson's support continues to dwindle.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nSo what will it be?

But as the summer closed, his momentum sagged. Just three weeks ago, even his campaign manager was voicing doubts publicly.\n\nNow with Election Day just two days away, polls show that Mr. Trump has rebounded. The idea of a New York real estate tycoon becoming the 45th president of the United States of America is growing more plausible.\n\nNate Silver's FiveThirtyEight.com now has Trump at a 35.4 percent chance of winning the presidency (up from just 12 percent three weeks ago), as polls in key battleground states have begun to swing in his favor, primarily as reluctant Republicans shift his way. One possible path to victory involves holding onto all the states Mitt Romney won in 2012 - including contested North Carolina, Arizona and Utah (where his favorability rating has tanked). He also needs to add Florida, Ohio and Iowa, and while flipping a blue state such as Pennsylvania or New Mexico.\n\nNevertheless, \" the Republican's chances keep growing ,\" concludes Jonathan Swan, for The Hill.\n\nBut even if he fails to overcome Hillary Clinton's lead, his unorthodox candidacy, so fraught with controversy and cynicism, has stunned American politics.\n\nTrump has remained steadfast through scandal and campaign shake-ups, from dissing Arizona Sen. John McCain's military service to his attack on conservative Fox TV media icon Megyn Kelly. His willingness to take on all comers, no matter their stripes, has fascinated many and energized millions of people who have felt marginalized or unrepresented.\n\n\"If you ignore frustration for too long, it finds its outlet ,\" J.D. Vance, the author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" told The Christian Science Monitor in late August.\n\nThe Republican candidate's contention that America has \"become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems\" has resonated far deeper than his character.\n\nBetween his hotel and resort properties, and seven seasons as a reality TV star, Trump entered the race with plenty of name recognition. But he also picked perhaps the perfect moment. The country has seen polarization (race, class, gender, income) seem to deepen throughout eight years with a Democrat in the White House. While the economy has rebounded, the recovery has been uneven.\n\nTrump appeals to working class whites, especially, who don't just feel marginalized by the coastal elites, but outright attacked. \"If somebody tells us to shut up, we're going to speak as loud as we can,\" as League of the South founder Michael Hill told the Monitor this summer.\n\nThat feeling that some Americans - perhaps a lot of Americans - aren't getting a seat at the table drove big crowds to both Trump and Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton's chief rival in the Democratic primary.\n\nOf course, to many, Clinton is the embodiment of elite privilege. The email scandal has summed that sense of privilege up for many voters.\n\nClinton's problems \"could be enough to get Trump into the White House,\" writes NPR's Sarah McCammon. \" Trump's candidacy has emboldened many Americans with a belief that the country's leaders are incompetent and corrupt, people who resent being told their thoughts and words are not politically correct.\" What's more, they see a changing country, foreign menaces, and a heartless economy that has left too many hardworking Americans behind.\n\nYet just weeks ago, Trump's campaign seemed to have finally derailed.\n\nA 2005 Access Hollywood video, in which he brags about acts that could constitute sexual assault, and his off-message rants seemed to be taking a toll. His poll numbers began tanking as Republican suburbanites, especially, recoiled. But those numbers have now reversed. Trump trails by just 1.8 percentage points on RealClearPolitics polling average; three weeks ago, Clinton had 7 point lead.\n\nHis late surge has been tied to several factors, but none bigger than the decision by FBI Director James Comey to announce his agency was looking at the emails of a top aide's husband, disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner. It seems to have reminded Americans of some of the sordid incidents of Bill Clinton's time in the White House, and Clinton's profile as a consummate Washington insider. Both candidates have seen gains in the polls when their opponent is enduring negative news, and that has affected primarily Clinton in the waning days of the campaign.\n\nTrump has also been more disciplined lately on the stump, at times being self-deprecating, and, at one recent stop, downplaying his financial bets as compared to the service of military veterans. He has dropped the talk of a rigged election in favor of his stalwart poll numbers. He has also stopped talking about a long, deserved vacation if he loses.\n\nHe has made progress with mainstream Republican voters who had been turned off, but are now facing the possibility of another Clinton presidency. White working-class women, for one, have begun to trend toward Trump in recent days. His support among Republicans as a whole has risen from 83 percent on Oct. 23, according to ABC News/Washington Post, to 88 percent now.\n\nCritically, key Republican leaders and arbiters - including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell - have affirmed their support for the Republican nominee.\n\nMany Americans fear a Trump win. A political neophyte, he's also seen by many as emblematic of the politics of toxic masculinity. His willingness to invite conspiracy theories seem to tear at fundamental societal contracts, including the voting franchise itself, which he claims can be stolen, despite lack of evidence.\n\nPresident Obama said on Friday that a Trump win would be \"badly damaging for this country and it would be damaging for the world.\"\n\nBut Trump has pushed back against assertions that he's not qualified, including direct pleas to Americans about his trustworthiness as a potential commander-in-chief. After clinching the nomination in June, he told Republicans, \"I understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle, and I will never, ever let you down.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Trump \"has been playing on anxieties, economic and otherwise, of a large swath of the American electorate,\" he said.\n\nTo be sure, at least according to polls, the election is Clinton's to lose.

      "text": "How the White House is handling Elon Musk and potential conflicts of interest\n\nAs the public face of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk has an expansive portfolio that spans across the many levers of government - and that could intersect with his wide range of business interests.\n\nBut unlike another high-profile \"special government employee\" working in Trump's White House, AI and crypto czar David Sacks , there's no evidence that Musk has obtained a conflict of interest waiver. Such a waiver would outline the steps he's taken to avoid overlaps between his business interests and his government work, include an explanation from the White House counsel about why they feel comfortable with Musk's arrangement, and it would identify areas where Musk has the green light to weigh in despite his business holdings.\n\nInstead, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News that Musk has already pledged he'd avoid potential conflicts of interest and like all Trump-appointed \"special government employees,\" he's \"abiding by all applicable laws.\"\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\n\"For concerns regarding conflicts of interest between Elon Musk and DOGE, President Trump has stated he will not allow conflicts, and Elon himself has committed to recusing himself from potential conflicts. DOGE has been incredibly transparent about what they're doing, posting daily updates on X and updating their website,\" Leavitt said in a statement to NBC News.\n\n\"It's standard practice for Administrations to hire individuals as Special Government Employees to focus on specific issues, based on their outside experience, for a limited period of time,\" Leavitt continued, adding, \"All SGEs are filling out the appropriate paperwork, receiving briefings on ethics rules, including the conflict of interest rules, and abiding by all applicable federal laws.\"\n\nThe White House first publicly acknowledged Musk's position on Feb. 3 , announcing he'd serve as a \"special government employee,\" a designation used by presidents over the years to allow outside experts to lend their knowledge to the government without having to ditch their private-sector jobs. The administration has sworn under oath that Musk is a \"senior adviser to the president,\" not a DOGE employee, though Trump has repeatedly emphasized that Musk is running the show there.\n\nIt's no secret that Musk's broad business portfolio, which includes the space company SpaceX and the electric vehicle company Tesla, intersects with a slew of government regulators and potential government contracts. That's why Democrats and others have raised concerns about how the government and Musk will ensure those conflicts don't creep into official administration decisions.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk told Fox Business that DOGE is \"pretty much\" in every federal department . In one example of the convergence of Musk's business interests and the federal government, Starlink, his satellite internet service, is being considered for use in more and more places across the federal government. Musk businesses like Tesla and SpaceX have received billions in government subsidies and contracts, and his interests have been involved in key regulatory battles with the federal government over the years.\n\nMusk's Tesla also relies heavily on China both for production and as a market - a relationship that came up Friday after Musk received a briefing at the Pentagon that included a discussion on China. During a conversation with reporters in the Oval Office hours later, Trump denied a report that the briefing would include military plans related to a hypothetical war with China , calling Musk a \"great patriot\" and saying that Musk's business dealings with China would be a reason not to show him something like that.\n\n\"I don't want to show that to anybody, but certainly you wouldn't show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. He's a great patriot. He's paying a big price for helping us cut costs, and he's doing a great job. He's finding tremendous waste, fraud and abuse,\" Trump said.\n\n\"But I certainly wouldn't want - you know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that, but it was such a fake story,\" Trump continued.\n\nAs a \"special government employee,\" Musk is subject to a series of legal restrictions and guardrails aimed at protecting the American people from concerns about conflicts of interest or an outside adviser making financial gains from their advice to the president.\n\nFederal law bars all employees of the executive branch from \"substantially\" participating in a \"particular matter\" where they, their immediate family or business partners have a \"financial interest,\" though that matter must have a \"direct and predictable effect on that interest\" to be forbidden.\n\nIf Musk sat on certain kinds of government committees, he could receive a waiver if it was deemed that the need for his services outweighed conflict concerns. But Musk is not publicly linked to a committee that would qualify.\n\nWith no indication he qualifies for that kind of waiver, Musk could also receive a conflict of interest waiver under a stricter standard: that \"the financial interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the employee's services.\" But it's not clear whether Musk sought, or received, any conflict of interest waivers.\n\nIn response to an NBC News inquiry about a potential waiver for Musk, the White House Counsel's office replied that \"the White House has no disclosures responsive to your request.\" And while some ethics documents are not immediately available for release, instead becoming public weeks after submission, the White House press office did not directly address whether Musk has sought or received a conflict of interest waiver that has not yet been released publicly.\n\nAnother special government employee, Sacks, did receive a conflict of interest waiver, which has been posted publicly on the White House's public disclosure portal (releasing these documents publicly upon request is mandated by federal law ). That 11-page memo , written by White House Counsel David Warrington, provides a roadmap to the kinds of conflict of interest rules that govern special government employees. The memo shows how Sacks has sought to divest his assets to satisfy the White House's lawyers, and it demonstrates why he is receiving a conflict of interest waiver in the first place that allows him to participate in \"certain particular matters regarding regulation and policy related to the digital asset industry.\"\n\n\"By its very nature, the position of Special Advisor for AI and Crypto requires an appointee with extensive and hands-on experience in financial technology and innovation, with intimate knowledge of the digital asset industry. It would be exceedingly difficult to find such expertise if financial technology executives, software company founders, and venture capital investors in the digital asset industry for excluded from the position,\" Warrington wrote in the memo granting Sacks a \"limited\" conflict of interest waiver.\n\n\"A core impetus for the nation's modern conflict of interest laws ... was a recognition that in matters of technology, science, and innovation, the Government required leaders from the private sector to lend their knowledge and experience to the shaping of national public policy,\" Warrington added.\n\nNeither Sacks nor Musk has to file a public financial disclosure. (The disclosures they have to file are allowed to remain private unless they begin drawing a substantial government salary.)\n\nA White House official told NBC News that the White House Counsel's Office vets all \"special government employees\" and advises them of the limits of where they can and can't participate. And the official added that the outside business interests of \"special government employees\" is a feature, not a bug, as the whole point of the status is to allow successful people to lend their expertise to the federal government.\n\nBut the lack of a public waiver, combined with Musk's sprawling business interests and impact across the federal government, raises concerns from some ethics officials, including those who have been critical of Trump and his administration over conflict of interests in the past.\n\n\"A conflict of interest waiver for Musk could not be justified,\" Walter Shaub, the former director of the United States Office of Government Ethics who resigned a few months into Trump's first term, wrote in an email. \"Elon Musk is the world's richest individual who is a government contractor. The American people have every reason to want their tax dollars and the resources of their national government to serve only their interests, not the interests of billionaire government contractor who now seems to have stuck his fingers in everything the government does.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "website": "https://www.cnbc.com",
      "text": "Trump's quest to conquer Canada is confusing everyone\n\nEight years ago, President Donald Trump spoke about the U.S.-Canada relationship in glowing terms.\n\nHe hosted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House in February 2017 for one of his first joint appearances alongside a foreign leader. Trump opened by noting the nations \"share much more than a border,\" highlighting \"the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together - which we have.\"\n\n\"America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada,\" Trump said. \"We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges, and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce.\"\n\nFast-forward to Thursday, weeks after Trump initiated a full-scale trade war with Canada, and it's clear the president doesn't believe the U.S. should share a border - or much else - with its Canadian neighbors.\n\nSpeaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump first mentioned his love for Canadians, including his \"many friends\" like hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. Then he riffed about how Canada shouldn't exist as a sovereign country before getting to what has increasingly become a fixation: wholesale annexation of Canada as a U.S. state.\n\n\"Canada only works as a state,\" Trump said Thursday. \"We don't need anything they have. As a state, it would be one of the great states anywhere. This would be the most incredible country, visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S. Just a straight, artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many many decades ago. Makes no sense. It's so perfect as a great and cherished state.\"\n\n\"But why should we subsidize another country for $200 billion?\" Trump continued, adding, \"And again, we don't need their lumber, we don't need their energy. We have more than they do. We don't need anything. We don't need their cars. I'd much rather make the cars here. And there's not a thing that we need. Now, there will be a little disruption, but it won't be very long. But they need us. We really don't need them. And we have to do this. I'm sorry.\"\n\nTrump has been unapologetic in his quest to conquer the Canadians - an effort he said in January would be conducted by \"economic force.\" The result has been a disintegration of the relationship between the U.S. and one of its closest allies, and a stock market plunge over fears of ever-increasing escalation of a trade war. Both Canadian officials and Republicans initially thought the president was merely joking , ribbing Trudeau - a longtime foil - after they met at Mar-a-Lago in November. It was after that visit that Trump first publicly floated the notion of absorbing Canada. Few think he's joking now, and the Canadians have stopped laughing.\n\nA source with direct knowledge of the discussions told NBC News that Trump is heavily focused on Canada in conversations with aides, who believe he is completely serious about making the country the 51st state - even with Trudeau out of power and a new prime minister in place.\n\nThere isn't exactly a groundswell of support for the idea. At a heated town hall in his district on Thursday, Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., was pointedly asked whether he supported Trump's push to annex Canada and Greenland.\n\n\"No,\" Edwards said. \"I do not.\"\n\nWhile Canadians said Trump did privately joke to Trudeau about Canada becoming a state during the president's first term, several officials who worked in Trump's White House said the broad assault on Canadian sovereignty was not born out of any conversations at the time. In fact, these former officials said they have no recollection of Trump ever raising the issue.\n\n\"Never, ever heard him mention it,\" one former White House official said. \"Ever. No clue where that is coming from.\"\n\nCongressional Republicans similarly did not recall such an idea being discussed in his first term.\n\n\"That's probably three nos,\" Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., said when asked if he recalled Trump expressing interest in acquiring Canada, redrawing borders or renegotiating treaties with the Canadians. \"No. At least in my recollection, this is all kind of new territory.\"\n\nA 68-page national security report Trump signed in December 2017 included only one mention of America's northern neighbor: \"Canada and the United States share a unique strategic and defense partnership.\"\n\nIn private, Trump has made specific demands the Canadians say they could never agree to. The president made clear in a phone call with Trudeau last month that he wants to revise the boundary between the two nations set by a 1908 border treaty, as two Canadian officials said and was previously reported by The New York Times and Toronto Star .\n\nIf Trump truly objects to the boundary line, the proper forum to resolve the dispute is the International Court of Justice , a Canadian official said.\n\nThe president has also mentioned renegotiating agreements that dictate how the Great Lakes and Columbia River are governed , the official told NBC News, adding that Trump wants to control the Northwest Passage , a maritime path that begins west of Greenland and cuts through Northern Canada to the Arctic Ocean.\n\n\"He wants our water,\" the Canadian official added. \"He wants to take the water.\"\n\nMarc Miller, the Canadian minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, said that for Trump, Canada's allure is its natural resources. The president separately wants American access to Ukraine's rare earth minerals as compensation for the aid given to the war-torn country.\n\n\"I do think that Mr. Trump looks at our natural resources and has that acquisitive mind behind it,\" Miller said, calling Trump's claims of the U.S. subsidizing Canada for $200 billion misleading.\n\nMiller said Canadians started truly taking Trump's threats of annexation seriously after his inauguration. He voiced disappointment that more allies have not spoken up in Canada's defense.\n\n\"I can't say this was totally predicted. Nor can anyone,\" Miller said. \"Frustratingly among our allies, everyone is ducking for cover.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has enacted wide-ranging and steep tariffs on a litany of Canadian goods. There have been some walkbacks . And then there has been escalation. Canada has instituted retaliatory measures. And the tit-for-tat trade war has intensified on a near daily basis.\n\nCanada is one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners, with nearly 80% of Canadian exports marked for the U.S. The country provides about 60% of U.S. crude oil imports, 85% of electricity imports and is also the biggest exporter of steel and aluminum into the U.S.\n\n\"Well, I think Canada is a neighbor,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a Tuesday briefing. \"They are a partner. They have always been an ally. Perhaps they are becoming a competitor now.\"\n\nTrump hasn't provided Canada with an obvious off-ramp for the tensions, either. He has objected to what he describes as steep Canadian tariffs on dairy imports from the U.S. and highlighted the importance of U.S. metals production . But he has also said a lead reason for the trade war is Canada's lack of urgency in dealing with the fentanyl crisis - even though just 43 pounds of fentanyl were seized by U.S. border agents entering the country from Canada during the last fiscal year, compared to 21,100 pounds coming from Mexico. And he has wrongly claimed American banks are not allowed to do business north of the border; the Canadian Banking Association said last month that 16 U.S. banks currently operate in Canada.\n\n\"Clearly, the president is looking for some results,\" said Amodei, who launched the bipartisan American Canadian Economy and Security Caucus in 2023 and reintroduced a House resolution affirming the U.S.-Canada partnership last month. \"I'm not sure those results are clearly defined.\"\n\nAmodei said Trump is above all looking for the U.S. to be \"treated fairly\" on trade, as Trump has pointed to examples where he believes Canada is not doing so.\n\n\"When you say, well, you want to be treated fairly, the question is, OK, define fairly.\" Amodei said. \"And I don't think 'fairly' is defined at the moment.\"\n\nCanadians view Trump's push to expand the U.S. into Canadian territory as beyond unfair. Mark Carney, the former Canadian and British central banker who was sworn in as prime minister on Friday, described \" dark days \" ahead for his nation after being elected to lead the Liberal Party.\n\n\"These are dark days - dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust,\" he said. \"We are getting over the shock - but let us never forget the lessons. We have to look after ourselves and we have to look out for each other.\"\n\nHe has since said he is ready to negotiate a renewed trade deal - Trump already renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement during his first term - so long as his nation's sovereignty is respected.\n\n\"If he wanted Canada - if he really wanted it - he's harmed the prospects of Canada being the 51st state by the way he's approached it,\" said John Bolton, a national security adviser during Trump's first term who has since broken with him.\n\nTrump's rhetoric is not necessarily being matched by other members of his administration. During a confirmation hearing on Thursday, Trump's pick to serve as ambassador to Canada, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., said \"Canada is a sovereign state,\" suggesting that the president's push for annexation was due to his relationship with Trudeau.\n\nAsked by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., how he can heal a \"negative relationship that has developed because of the president's statements,\" while \"addressing tariff issues,\" Hoekstra responded: \"Obviously, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about that myself.\"\n\nNearly 800 miles north of Washington, D.C., at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Quebec , reporters pressed Secretary of State Marco Rubio about Trump's push to make Canada the 51st state. Rubio said there would be no such conversation at the G7 gathering.\n\n\"It is not a meeting about how we're going to take over Canada,\" Rubio said.\n\nA senior State Department official described \"a need to separate out trade policy\" from \"broader cooperation on foreign affairs, and that's challenging.\"\n\n\"But there is broad agreement that we cannot allow real disagreements on certain issues to prevent us from working together on areas of agreement, especially critical foreign policy issues including migration, China, and of course Russia and Ukraine,\" this person added.\n\nWhat also confounds Republicans about Trump's idea is that annexing Canada would potentially add millions more Democrats to American voter rolls. Canada is a liberal-leaning nation with a population larger than California. Were Canada to become a state, it could mean 50 more House seats and two additional senators - auguring a real power shift in government.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nKennedy spends first month as health secretary downplaying vaccines and targeting food additives\n\nFarmers face steep losses in the middle of Trump's trade war and funding cuts\n\nMore than 50 universities face federal investigations as part of Trump's anti-DEI campaign\n\n\"They'd have a sizable delegation in the House,\" Amodei said. \"\"I don't think anybody thinks that's a great idea. Oh, by the way, how many Electoral College votes are they going to get?\"\n\nTrump's history of managing the U.S.-Canada relationship is intertwined with his own personal relationship with Trudeau who, up until this week, has been his only Canadian counterpart. At times, their relationship has been fruitful, like when they reworked the trade agreement governing commerce between their nations. But there has been animosity , too.\n\nNow, annexation threats have ignited a \"wave of patriotism in Canada\" unlike any Miller has seen.\n\n\"Not hiding the fact that it can do a lot more damage to Canada than the U.S.,\" Miller said, noting the U.S. is Canada's top trading partner. \"But we have a high pain threshold and we're ready to fight.\"\n\nThere's a reason Canada believes it can win the fight, too. Its citizenry is united against relinquishing its national sovereignty, while the U.S. is divided over Trump's trade war - especially as the stock market slides.\n\n\"Trump's position is vulnerable because he doesn't have the support of the American business community,\" the Canadian official said. \"And we know that.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump signs executive order to dismantle the Department of Education-'See you in court,' teachers' union says\n\nRelated Stories\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday instructing Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to begin dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nThe president cannot unilaterally abolish a federal agency without the approval of Congress. As such, a bill to close ED would require support from some Congressional Democrats, which is not expected to happen.\n\nStill, Trump is making good on a promise he made on the campaign trail and attempting to fulfill a long-sought political goal of returning education authority solely to the states. Republicans have been trying to abolish the department for decades, including a bill introduced in the House of Representatives in January.\n\nThe idea is largely unpopular with voters: Nearly 60% of all voters oppose closing ED entirely, a fall 2024 poll found.\n\nSome who oppose Trump's plan are preparing to fight back. \"See you in court,\" Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation's largest teacher unions, said in a statement .\n\nTrump's order comes just a week after his administration laid off nearly half of ED employees. Educators, student loan borrowers and advocates worried that move alone could create issues for schools, students and federal student loan borrowers as the personnel needed to manage programs like funding for disabled students and federal financial aid were no longer employed.\n\n\"This executive order won't do anything to improve the lives of students or student loan borrowers,\" Aaron Ament, president at The National Student Legal Defense Network, an advocacy nonprofit, said in a March 19 statement . \"The notion that the Department can be summarily closed or functionally decimated while maintaining 'uninterrupted delivery of services, programs and benefits on which Americans rely' - as the order reportedly directs - is a pipe dream.\"\n\nED's primary role is managing money for a number of education initiatives. In particular, it provides funding for public K-12 schools, administers federal financial aid and manages the federal student loan portfolio. Education advocates are concerned that putting these programs in the hands of different agencies could have devastating impacts.\n\nThe Treasury Department, for example, could wind up managing student loans in ED's absence. But that agency is intended to focus on federal revenue and tax collections, rather than setting standards for excellence in education, Abby Shafroth, co-director of advocacy and director of the student borrower assistance program at the National Consumer Law Center, told CNBC Make It in February.\n\nFurther, over 180,000 teaching positions at Title I schools, which primarily serve low-income students, could be eliminated with the closure of ED, according to the Center for American Progress , a progressive think tank.\n\nThe department also administers roughly $15 billion in funding for children with disabilities, who may lose necessary services and support if ED closes, according to the National Education Association , one of the country's largest labor unions.\n\nDespite the Trump administration's move to dismantle the department, funding for these programs, which includes Pell Grants for college students, will be preserved, but redistributed to other agencies, Trump said on Thursday ahead of the executive order's signing.\n\nAs for federal student loans, it's unclear which agency may assume responsibility for issuing new loans and managing the $1.6 trillion in debt borrowers currently owe. Trump suggested earlier in March that the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or Small Business Administration may take over.\n\nMany borrowers are already sitting in limbo due to legal challenges against former President Joe Biden's Saving on a Valuable Education income-driven repayment plan. Those who enrolled are currently in an administrative forbearance expected to last until at least December.\n\nOther borrowers looking for affordable monthly payments can't access the application for any income-driven repayment plans. It's unclear when they will be able to. ED is \"reviewing repayment applications to conform with the 8th Circuit's ruling,\" a spokesperson for the agency told CNBC in February.\n\nSeveral organizations, including AFT and Student Defense, have promised to challenge the Trump administration's ED action in court. When those lawsuits are filed, they will join a number of legal challenges already waged against the administration over its education-related decisions.\n\nAttorneys general from 21 Democratic states filed a suit against McMahon and the Trump administration last week over the layoffs at ED, which they argue are \"equivalent to incapacitating key, statutorily-mandated functions of the Department, causing immense damage to Plaintiff States and their educational systems.\"\n\nSeparately, AFT sued the Trump administration earlier this week for preventing access to income-driven repayment plans for federal student loan borrowers.\n\nWant to earn some extra money on the side?

But the word flexibility is an important word,\" he said. \"Sometimes it's flexibility. So there'll be flexibility, but basically it's reciprocal.\"\n\nTrump has hyped the April 2 start date for his reciprocal tariffs as America's \"liberation day.\"\n\nTrump and his officials say the plan will effectively assign tariff rates to all countries that have their own tariffs on U.S. goods. Countries with other non-tariff trade policies that the Trump administration opposes, such as value-added taxes, could also be subject to new duties.\n\nTrump also said Friday that he plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping . Beijing has already slapped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products in response to Trump's broad tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nTrump has issued a flurry of tariff announcements since retaking the White House, fanning investor uncertainty and fears of a major trade war.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet,'\" Trump added.\n\nThe sweeping cuts carried out by DOGE have led to lawsuits , voter anxiety and heightened concerns from congressional Republicans.\n\nTrump's message was also a rare public curtailing of Musk's authority as he moves to help reshape the federal government, at times stepping on the Cabinet secretaries' toes.\n\nSeveral members of Trump's Cabinet bristled when Musk recently ordered federal employees to outline their work or face termination, with multiple agencies and departments initially fending off the effort.\n\nAt the same time, Trump also praised Musk and DOGE after Thursday's meeting.\n\n\"I think they've done an amazing job,\" he told reporters.\n\nMusk called the meeting \"very productive\" in a post on X. It was his second time attending a Trump Cabinet meeting; he dominated the first gathering last month when he called DOGE a \"support function\" to help the federal agencies \"find 15% reduction in fraud and waste.\"\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday that his directive to his Cabinet members was: \"Keep all the people you want, all the people that you need.\"\n\nBut he also indicated that Musk would step in if the department heads don't make sufficient cuts.\n\n\"If they can cut, it's better.

      "text": "Trump says the Fed should cut rates to ease the economy's transition to his tariffs\n\nAfter largely staying out of the Federal Reserve's business during his first two months in office, President Donald Trump is pushing the central bank to cut interest rates as a backstop for his tariff plans.\n\nIn a post Wednesday night on Truth Social , Trump encouraged Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues to ease policy as the administration enters the next phase of its aggressive trade policy.\n\n\"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S.Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,\" Trump wrote. \"Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!\"\n\nThe missive appeared just hours after the Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its key interest rate steady but indicated that two rate reductions are likely by the end of the year, assuming the quarter percentage point increments that policymakers prefer.\n\nThe April 2 reference is to when the administration will reveal the results of a study into global trade, likely resulting in further tariffs in an effort to level what it considers an unfair playing field.\n\nAt his post-meeting news conference , Powell addressed the tariff issue multiple times, largely reiterating the uncertain impact they could have as justifying the Fed's cautious current stance. In addition, Powell indicated that the duties could raise inflation in the short run but the impacts then would recede over time.\n\n\"I think that's kind of the base case. But as I said, we really can't know that. We're going to have to see how things actually work out,\" he said.\n\nLower rates, however, could combine with tariffs to stir more inflation. Markets expect the Fed will wait until June before cutting. Fed rate reductions also don't always feed directly into lower borrowing rates. In the best-case scenario, lower rates would help buttress rising prices that are expected to come from the levies.\n\nIn contrast to his first term in office, Trump had thus far taken a mostly hands-off approach to Fed policymaking, aside from a few comments he made shortly after taking office also coaxing the central bank to lower rates. Trump in January said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately,\" though he didn't follow through on the threat.\n\nIn fact, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said that the White House is more focused on bringing down the 10-year Treasury yield to lower long-term borrowing costs than it is on the short-term federal funds rate that the Fed controls.\n\nTrump berated Powell and the Fed the last time around for raising rates, at one point calling them \"boneheads\" and comparing the chair to a golfer who couldn't putt.\n\nFed projections Wednesday indicated a full percentage point of cuts over the next three years for the funds rate, which is currently targeted between 4.25%-4.5%.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump turns the White House lawn into a Tesla showroom\n\nIn this article\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday turned the South Lawn of the White House into a temporary Tesla showroom in a conspicuous favor to his adviser Elon Musk , the billionaire CEO of the car company.\n\nTesla delivered five of its vehicles to the White House and parked them on a driveway for Trump to personally inspect, hours after he said in a post on his app Truth Social that he planned to buy a Tesla to demonstrate his support for Musk and for the slumping car company .\n\nWith Musk beside him, Trump declared the vehicles \"beautiful\" and in particular praised the company's unusually designed Cybertruck.\n\n\"As soon as I saw it, I said, 'That is the coolest design,'\" Trump said.\n\nThough Trump frequently attacked electric vehicles during last year's campaign, he told reporters that he'd heard good things about Teslas from his friends. He sat in the driver's seat of a sedan, with Musk seated beside him, and said he planned to buy one.\n\n\"The one I like is that one, and I want the same color,\" he said, pointing to a red Model S. The vehicle is listed on the Tesla website for $73,490, or $88,490 for the all-wheel-drive Model S Plaid.\n\nHe did not take a test drive but said he might \"another time.\"\n\nBecause of ethical restraints it is extremely rare for a senior government official, let alone a sitting president, to endorse a consumer product so explicitly. In 2017, when then-Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway told Americans to buy from Ivanka Trump's clothing line, she received a warning from a government ethics office and promised never to do it again.\n\nBy reviewing the Teslas in public before cameras, Trump ensured that his purchase would receive wide attention. Dan Scavino, a White House deputy chief of staff, livestreamed the event on X, the social media app owned by Musk.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the application of ethics rules.\n\nTrump said he would pay for the vehicle by check.\n\nIn his first weeks in office, Trump has increasingly moved away from the populist policies and messaging of both his first term and his campaigns, instead embracing the interests and agendas of his billionaire backers. Musk, in particular, has led the administration's push to cut thousands of largely middle-class federal jobs, and Americans are seeing their retirement savings tank as the stock market plummets amid uncertainty over Trump's policies. Yet it was Musk that Trump focused on boosting Tuesday.\n\nTesla, meanwhile, has faced an extended global backlash to Musk's increasing role in politics, most notably for his role in slashing government jobs and recent promotion of far-right parties including Germany's AfD . The company's shares have declined every week since Musk went to Washington, and they fell 15% on Monday before rebounding Tuesday. Tesla facilities have faced a wave of both peaceful demonstrations and vandalism, including fires at charging stations.\n\nAsked whether his purchase might help Tesla's stock, Trump said, \"I hope it does.\"\n\nDuring the event, Trump held a piece of paper with notes about Tesla features, according to photos of the notes published by Getty Images. The notes appeared to be something of a sales pitch, including details that Teslas could be purchased for $299 a month and that all vehicles \"have self-driving\" - a reference to the company's suite of driver-assistance features, which cost extra and still require human supervision .\n\nTrump condemned the vandalism and heaped praise on the company.\n\n\"They're harming a great American company,\" he said. Referring to Musk, he said: \"He's built this great company, and he shouldn't be penalized because he's a patriot.\"\n\nMusk, standing next to Trump, said that Tesla planned to double vehicle output in the United States.\n\nMusk is at the center of growing tension within the government about his role as a White House adviser and head of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. The Trump administration is battling lawsuits that say Musk has exceeded his authority under the law and the Constitution, and members of Trump's Cabinet have privately expressed frustrations about Musk's involvement in their agencies.\n\nMusk was a major financial supporter of Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, spending more than a quarter of a billion dollars and making personal appearances on Trump's behalf in the swing state Pennsylvania. Musk also turned X into a pro-Trump media platform .\n\nIn a post on Truth Social shortly after midnight, early Tuesday morning, Trump was unabashed in his reason for buying a Tesla.\n\n\"I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,\" he wrote.\n\nIt's not clear when, if ever, Trump would have the chance to drive a car of any kind unless he does so within the White House complex or similarly secure area. Presidents are driven around in a custom limousine with special security features.\n\n\"I haven't bought a new car in a long time,\" Trump said.\n\nRead more NBC News\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump White House has asked U.S. military to develop options for the Panama Canal, officials say\n\nWASHINGTON - The White House has directed the U.S. military to draw up options for increasing the American troop presence in Panama to achieve President Trump's goal of \"reclaiming\" the Panama Canal, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.\n\nDuring a joint address to Congress last week, Trump said, \"to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal.\" Since then, administration officials have not said what \"reclaiming\" means.\n\nU.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans that vary from partnering more closely with the Panamanian military to the less likely option of U.S. troops seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much the Panamanian military agrees to partner with the U.S.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nThe Trump administration's goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China's influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said.\n\nBoth Panama and China deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama's Constitution. Chinese officials have accused the U.S. of using \"coercion\" to pressure Panamanian officials to block Chinese aid projects.\n\nThe U.S. officials told NBC News that the commander of U.S. Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey, presented draft strategies to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week. Hegseth is expected to visit Panama next month.\n\nThe officials cautioned that a U.S. invasion of Panama is unlikely and would only come under serious consideration if a larger American military presence in Panama does not achieve President Donald Trump's goal of reclaiming the waterway, the officials said.\n\nNeither the Pentagon nor the Panamanian Embassy in Washington immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nTrump has said he intends to return ownership of the canal to the U.S. after Panama gained control of the area more than a quarter century ago under a treaty signed by the Carter administration.\n\nPrivately, Trump has told his advisers that he sees a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself as critical to that effort, the U.S. officials said. Trump has also made it clear that he wants U.S. service members to be visible in the canal zone as a show of force.\n\nTrump administration officials have argued that China has too large a presence near the canal. In the event of a conflict, they say, Beijing could shut down the canal to American shipping, including military ships.\n\nDuring a visit to Panama last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino that \"the status quo is unacceptable\" regarding China's presence in Panama. Mulino has said the Panamanian government alone administers the canal and denied ceding operation of the canal to China in any way.\n\nLast month, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the U.S. after Panama declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China. Lin said that China's investments in Panama were part of its Belt and Road development initiative and \"firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.\"\n\nThe U.S. military currently has more than 200 troops in Panama but the number fluctuates as troops rotate in and out, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Some of those troops include Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats, insurgencies or unrest.\n\nPotential administration strategies include simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal, to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of the passageway, officials said. Other options under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, to build new ports in Panama or  using the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal's locks, officials said.\n\nThere are also discussions about opening Army Jungle Schools, or training camps, in Panama, like the ones U.S. troops trained in jungle warfare until the canal was formally handed over to Panama in 1999.\n\nOne other focus of the ongoing planning is potentially positioning U.S. military forces near Panama in the event of a regional war or a threat to the U.S. In that scenario, the U.S. military would aim to secure the Panama Canal and eliminate China's access to the critical waterway. American officials cautioned that the U.S. would only block Chinese transit through the canal in the event of war.\n\nThe Panama Canal is one of the world's busiest waterways, with the majority of the cargo that passes through it originating in the U.S. or heading to the U.S. If the Panama Canal were blocked, ships would have to transit around South America, sharply increasing the cost and time of each voyage.\n\nThe U.S. constructed the canal from 1904 to 1914 after a failed French effort. In 1977, after long-running protests by Panamanians, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty that turned control of the canal over to Panama. In 1989, during the George H.W. Bush administration, U.S. forces invaded Panama and ousted the country's leader, Manuel Noriega, who was later convicted of drug trafficking.\n\nIn his joint address to Congress last week, Trump said that the U.S. was already moving to limit Chinese presence in the canal. \"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.\"\n\nThe U.S. investment company BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90% stake in the Panama Ports Company , which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal. The stake is being purchased from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

More Washington, DC. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\nApril 25 -Net -12 approval rating: Trump had a 42% approval rating and 54% disapproval rating in a New York Times/Siena poll that also found the majority of voters reject his handling of immigration, management of the federal government, the economy, trade, foreign conflicts, the Russia-Ukraine war and the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia (the poll of 913 voters conducted April 21-24 has a 3.8-point margin of error).\n\nMore than half also said the words \"scary\" and \"chaotic\" describe the Trump presidency well, including significant shares of Republicans: 47% for chaotic and 36% for scary, though 82% of Republicans also said the word \"exciting\" describes Trump's tenure well.\n\nApril 23 -19: Pew found 59% of 3,589 respondents to an April 7-13 survey (margin of error 1.8) disapprove of Trump's job performance, compared to 40% who approve, a seven-point decline in his approval rating since February.\n\nThe majority of respondents said they aren't confident in Trump to handle each of the 10 issues Pew asked about, while the 45% who said they're confident in Trump to handle the economy represent his worst marks since 2019.\n\nApril 23 -11: A majority, 53%, of respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken April 16-21 disapprove of Trump's job performance, while 42% approve, a steep decline from his +6 net approval rating in the groups' poll taken during the first week of his second term, but largely unchanged from the groups' previous survey taken March 31-April 2 (the latest poll of 4,306 U.S. adults has a margin of error of 2).\n\nTrump's handling of the economy received a net -14 approval rating (37% to 51%), better than Biden's 34% economic approval rating in December, but below Trump's worst economic approval rating (44%) during his first term, Retuers/Ipsos found.\n\nApril 23 -30: A Harvard Kennedy School survey of young adults found 61% disapprove of Trump and 31% approve, while 42% think Trump will hurt their personal finances and 20% believe he'll help, 9% said he'll have no impact and 26% said they don't know (the poll of 2,096 18- to 29-year-olds taken March 14-25 has a margin of error of 3.2).\n\nYounger voters typically lean toward Democratic presidential candidates, though Vice President Kamala Harris' numbers with the demographic were below the 60% average support for Democratic presidential candidates since 2008, according to a NPR analysis.\n\nWhile more young men voted for Trump in 2024-56% compared to 41% in 2020, according to an analysis of Associated Press exit polls by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University-the Harvard poll found 34% of young men approve of Trump's job performance and 59% disapprove.\n\nApril 23 -13: An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,625 U.S. adults taken April 19-22 (margin of error 3) found 54% disapprove of the way Trump is doing his job, compared to 41% who approve, representing a two-point decline in Trump's approval rating since the groups' previous poll released April 16.\n\nApril 21 -6 : Trump's approval rating improved (from 45% to 46%) for the first time since February in Morning Consult's latest weekly poll , while 52% disapprove of his job performance, though his handling of the economy received its worst marks-49% disapproval compared to 44% approval-since the start of his trade war in April (the latest poll of 2,207 registered voters conducted April 18-20 has a margin of error of 2).\n\nApril 17 -9 : More than half, 53%, of respondents disapprove of Trump's job performance in Gallup's April 1-14 survey of 1,006 adults (margin of error 4), while 44% approve.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who Trump recently said he's considering firing, has a 37% approval rating, beneath the lowest approval ratings for the previous three federal reserve chairs, but above his 36% average approval rating in 2023, Gallup found.\n\nApril 16 -10: An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,512 U.S. adults found 52% disapprove of Trump's job performance, compared to 42% who approve (margin of error 3.4).\n\nApril 14 -7: Trump's approval rating dropped to a new low for his second term in Morning Consult's weekly poll , with 45% approving of his job performance and 52% disapproving (the poll of 2,203 registered voters was taken April 11-13 and has a 2-point margin of error).\n\nOn trade, Trump has a net -5 approval rating, and 24% of respondents said it's a top priority for Trump, though only 48% think it should be.\n\nApril 14 +2: Representing an outlier in polls taken since Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, Harvard CAPS/Harris found 48% approve of Trump's job performance and 46% disapprove, a seven-point decline in his net approval rating compared to the groups' February poll and a two-point decline since March (the latest survey was taken April 9-10 among 2,286 registered voters and has a 1.9-point margin of error).\n\nVoters' perceptions of the economy as a whole are largely unchanged since January, even though a greater share, 45%, say their financial situation is getting worse, compared to 41% in the groups' previous survey in March-while Trump's handling of inflation, and tariffs and trade policy, had the worst approval ratings, both at 41%, of eight issues the poll asked about.\n\nApril 14 -7: A University of Massachusetts poll of 1,000 U.S. adults conducted April 4-9 by YouGov found 51% disapprove of Trump's job performance, while 44% approve (the poll has a 3.7-point margin of error).\n\nTrump received his worst approval rating of six issues the poll asked about on inflation (33%), followed by trade (36%), civil rights (36%), jobs (38%), foreign affairs (39%) and immigration (50%).\n\nApril 13 -6: More than half, 53%, of the 2,410 U.S. adults who responded to an April 8-11 CBS/YouGov poll said they disapprove of Trump's job performance, compared to 47% who approve (margin of error 2.4 points), a dip in Trump's rating since the groups' March survey that found equal shares of Americans approve and disapprove.\n\nThe poll also found 58% oppose and 42% favor Trump's new tariffs on imported goods, but 51% like his goals for the tariffs-to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and decrease the import/export margins between the U.S. and its trading partners, he has said-though 63% dislike his approach for achieving those goals.\n\nMore Americans, 59%, believe Trump is using the new tariffs to negotiate with other countries and will remove them later, compared to 41% who think he'll keep them permanently.\n\nApril 9 -12: Trump's disapproval rating stayed stagnant, at 53%, in the latest Quinnipiac University poll taken April 3-7 among 1,407 self-identified registered voters, though his approval rating decreased one point, to 41%, compared to the group's previous survey taken in March (the shift is within the poll's 2.6-point margin of error).\n\nThe poll found the majority of voters (72%) think Trump's tariffs on all U.S. trading partners would hurt the economy in the short-term, while 53% said they believe the policy would hurt the economy in the long-term.\n\nApril 9 -8: A new Economist/YouGov survey taken April 5-8, after Trump's sweeping tariff announcement on April 2, found 51% disapprove of his job performance, compared to 43% who approve, a five-point swing since the groups' previous survey taken March 30-April 1 (the latest survey of 1,741 U.S. adults has a margin of error of 3.1 points).\n\nApril 7 -6: Representing the lowest rating of his second term in Morning Consult's weekly poll , 46% of registered voters surveyed said they approve of Trump's job performance, compared to 52% who said they disapprove (the survey of 2,207 registered U.S. voters was conducted April 4-6 and has a margin of error of 2 points).\n\nTrump's net approval rating on trade also declined to -3, down from +13 just after taking office in January.\n\nApril 2 -8: A Marquette Law school poll found Trump has a 46% approval rating and a 54% disapproval rating (the survey of 1,021 U.S. adults was taken March 17-27 and has a margin of error of 3.5 points).\n\nThe majority, 58%, of respondents said they think tariffs hurt the economy, while 28% said they help and 14% said they don't make much difference-as Trump has imposed new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, steel aluminum and auto imports, and is expected to announce a new round of reciprocal tariffs against U.S. trading partners Wednesday, which the White House is referring to as \"Liberation Day.\"\n\nMarch 31 -3: Half of the 2,210 registered voters surveyed by Morning Consult March 28-30 (margin of error 2) said they disapprove of Trump's job performance-a one-point improvement since the group's survey a week prior-while his approval rating stayed at 47%.\n\nMarch 31 -14: More than half, 56%, of 1,229 U.S. adults surveyed March 20-24 by AP-NORC said they strongly or somewhat disapprove or lean towards disapproving of Trump's job performance as president, while his net approval rating totaled 42% (the poll has a 3.9-point margin of error).\n\nMarch 30 Even: A CBS/YouGov poll found equal shares of the 2,609 U.S. adults surveyed March 27-28 approve or disapprove of Trump's job performance (margin of error 2.3), while 55% said he is focusing \"too much\" on putting tariffs on goods from other countries and 38% said it's the \"right amount\" of focus.\n\nMarch 25 +2: Trump's net approval rating ticked up two points in an Economist/YouGov survey conducted March 22-25, compared to the group's previous poll taken earlier this month, with 48% of 1,600 U.S. adults surveyed saying they approve of the president's job performance, compared to 46% who disapprove (the poll has a three-point margin of error).\n\nMarch 25 -6: More than half, 51%, of 1,030 U.S. adults surveyed by Reuters/Ipsos from March 21-23 (margin of error 3) disapprove of Trump's job performance, compared to 45% who approve .\n\nMarch 24 -4: Morning Consult recorded a record high disapproval rating of 51% for Trump and a record-low approval rating of 47% for his second term in its March 21-23 survey of 2,210 registered voters (margin of error 2), a two-point net decline for Trump since the group's previous weekly poll.\n\nMarch 19 -4: A March 7-11 NBC News poll of 1,000 registered voters found 47% approve of Trump and 51% disapprove (margin of error 3.1).\n\nMarch 17 -2: For the first time in Trump's second term, he had a net negative approval rating in Morning Consult's weekly poll of 2,210 registered voters taken March 14-16 (margin of error 2), with 50% saying they disapprove and 48% saying they approve.\n\nThe share of registered voters who say they identify with Trump's Make America Great Again movement has increased sharply during Trump's second term, according to NBC polling. A total of 36% of 1,000 registered voters polled March 7-11 said they consider themselves part of the MAGA coalition, compared to a 23% average in NBC's March polling and 27% in the network's 2024 polls (the most recent poll has a 3.1-point margin of error).\n\nA significant share of Americans lack a basic understanding of tariffs, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found less than half support universal tariffs, but favor targeted tariffs on countries \"taking advantage\" of the global trade system. The survey of 1,027 U.S. adults taken April 4-6 found 32%, including 19% of Republicans, 49% of Democrats and 30% of independents, incorrectly believe tariffs \"are taxes paid by the country exporting the goods.\" Less than half of all respondents (39%) support Trump's 10% tax on all U.S. trading partners, on Canadian imports (35%), imports from Mexico (39%), and 25% global tariffs on imported cars (35%). There was a stark partisan divide in the sentiment-at least 70% of Republicans said they support all four taxes, compared to about 10% of Democrats. However, 76% overall said they support tariffs aimed at countries that \"have been taking advantage of the U.S.\" on trade.\n\n45%. That's Trump's average approval rating so far during his second term, higher than his 41% average approval rating throughout the duration of his first term, according to Gallup , but lower than every other post World War II president.\n\n57%, according to Gallup's average for the three weeks of April 2021.\n\nTrump announced a new slate of tariffs against all U.S. trading partners on April 2, sending stock markets in the U.S. and abroad into a tailspin, fueling recession fears and prompting some of his allies in the business community to speak out against the policy. A 10% baseline tariff on all countries took effect April 5, and steeper rates for countries the U.S. runs a trade deficit were imposed for less than a day in mid-April, until Trump announced a 90-day pause for all countries except China. Trump's April 2 tariff announcement largely quieted the media frenzy surrounding the leak of U.S. military attack plans to Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, what was widely considered to be the first major blunder of his second term. Trump's tariff war with U.S. trading partners, and his efforts to slash the federal workforce with the help of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, have largely consumed his first two months in office. Other major moments include his explosive Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy in which he and Vice President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president in front of the media and his use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants. The latter, along with the mass firings that have taken place across dozens of government agencies, have prompted numerous legal battles that have led to accusations the Trump administration has defied court orders , sparking debate about the judiciary's authority over the executive branch.\n\nTrump Announces Reciprocal Tariff Rates-54% For China, 20% On EU (Forbes)\n\nAppeals Court Strikes Down Trump Request To Fire Workers: Here's Where Trump And Musk Are Winning-And Losing-In Court (Forbes)\n\nHere's Where Trump's Government Layoffs Are Targeted-As Pentagon Reportedly Plans 60,000 Job Cuts (Forbes)\n\nOne Community.

Now What?\n\nBy Peter Greene\n\nBy Peter Greene ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 20: U.S. President Donald Trump signs an executive order to reduce the size ... More and scope of the Education Department alongside school children signing their own versions, during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House on March 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. The order instructs Education Secretary Linda McMahon, former head of the Small Business Administration and co-founder of the World Wrestling Entertainment, to shrink the $100 billion department, which cannot be dissolved without Congressional approval. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued his anticipated executive order to close the U.S. Department of Education . But the order is short on specifics; what can Trump and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon actually legally do?\n\nThe Department of Education was created in 1979, but many of its signature responsibilities actually pre-date the department itself. While the department may administer these programs, it did not create them.\n\nTitle I, which provides federal funding to help bolster local education resources for low-income families, was established as part of the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (more commonly known as IDEA) was originally passed as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975.\n\nAs previous budgets show, those two programs account for over $30 billion in funding from the department to local school districts. Established by Congress, these are programs that in theory cannot be simply ended by a president.\n\nAfter citing rationale for closing the department, the critical portion of the executive order is this:\n\nThe Secretary of Education shall, to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.\n\n\"The maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law\" is the crux of the matter. The department cannot be dissolved without an act of Congress, though the administration could continue to hollow out the department by firing more staff . As CNN reported, White House press secretary said ahead of the signing that the order would move to \"greatly minimize the agency,\" and that certain \"critical functions\" would remain under the department umbrella.\n\n\"Critical functions\" could be any of the grant programs that were created by Congress. Project 2025 proposed turning Title I and IDEA funds into block grants to the states to use as they wish, with Title I funding to be reduced to zero in 10 years. And Trump has also said that he would cut off funding to schools that did not comply with certain requirements.\n\nOther functions of the department have already been hit by personnel cuts, including t he Office of Civil Rights (as reported by CNN ) and the National Center for Educational Statistics (as reported by ABC News ). The NCES collects and compiles data about U.S. education, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the source of data that the executive order cites in its rationale for the closing of the department.\n\nSchool funding expert Bruce Baker, writing for the Albert Shanker Institute , estimates that eliminating federal aid would lead to major drops in student achievement, a sort of federally induced learning loss. The effect of turning them to block grants would depend on how the state used the money; Baker notes the irony that state grants would be based on need, but the state would not be under any obligation to give the money to districts where that need exists. Baker predicts the block grants would exacerbate the achievement gaps in most states.\n\nIn the end, the executive order doesn't tell us much that we didn't know--Trump intends to end the department, somehow, while maintaining some of the programs, in some form.\n\nEducation Reform Now , an education reform advocacy group, has created a simple explainer for breaking down the areas of authority over the department and its program and showing what legal limits Trump and McMahon will face. First, who has the actual power for certain acts?\n\nWho has the power?\n\nWhich programs would require an act of Congress for change?\n\nThe department's programs\n\nThe only question really answered today is whether or not Trump will really try to shut down the department. We now know the unsurprising answer is yes. We still don't know what, exactly, that will look like."

      "text": "Trump's Sister Declared The Immigration Law He Used Unconstitutional\n\nBy Stuart Anderson\n\nBy Stuart Anderson ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nDonald Trump talks to reporters from the Resolute Desk after signing an executive order on January ... More 30, 2025. In a historical twist, Donald Trump's sister was the federal judge who ruled unconstitutional the immigration law the Trump administration is using to deport a pro-Palestinian protester. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nIn a historical twist, Donald Trump's sister was the federal judge who ruled unconstitutional the immigration law the Trump administration is using to deport a pro-Palestinian protester. In 1996, U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry wrote an opinion that declared unconstitutional the part of U.S. immigration law that Donald Trump has promised to continue employing to deport protesters. The current case has captured headlines and will test the Trump administration's immigration authority.\n\nOn March 8, 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and pro-Palestinian protester who graduated in December from Columbia University. Controversy over the arrest surrounded the Trump administration using a provision in immigration law that allows for deportation if the Secretary of State believes an alien's presence or activities \"would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"\n\nIn 1995, Secretary of State Warren Christopher used the same authority when attempting to deport Ruiz Massieu to Mexico. As presented by the court documents, the circumstances in that case were quite different from the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nIn September 1994, Ruiz Massieu's brother, a prominent member of PRI, Mexico's ruling party, was assassinated. As Deputy Attorney General, Ruiz Massieu investigated and identified a PRI official, Manuel Munoz Rocha, as the lead conspirator in his brother's killing. Rocha was protected, first by official immunity and later by disappearing before an interview could be conducted. In late November 1994, Massieu resigned in a public speech and later published a book criticizing the PRI.\n\nAfter Mexican officials sought his arrest, he entered the United States legally as a visitor (he owned property in Texas) and flew to Spain with a stopover at Newark Airport. In Newark, he was arrested for declaring only $18,000 of the $44,322 in cash with him. While the declaration infraction was later dropped, the Mexican government charged him with crimes \"against the administration of justice\" and sought his extradition.\n\nThe U.S. government failed four times to convince a judge that Massieu should be extradited to Mexico. The Mexican government showed that Massieu had $9 million in a bank account in Houston but could not prove that it had been illegally obtained.\n\n\"It was then, however, that this case took a turn toward the truly Kafkaesque,\" writes U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, Donald Trump's sister. She notes that the Immigration and Naturalization Service took Massieu into custody. \"He was ordered to show cause as to why he should not be deported because, the Secretary of State has made a determination that . . . there is reasonable ground to believe your presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States .\" (Emphasis added.) In 1996, the provision was Section 241(a)(4)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act but it was later redesignated Section 237(a)(4)(C)(i) due to other changes in the INA. The language in both designations is identical.\n\nOn February 28, 1996, U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry issued an opinion declaring unconstitutional the provision in the Immigration and Nationality now being used in the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil. He is being held in a detention facility in Louisiana.\n\n\"Notwithstanding the political branches' near plenary power over aliens, this power is circumscribed by the constitutional constraints imposed on the exercise of all governmental authority,\" wrote the judge in her opinion in Massieu v. Reno . \"It is a fundamental tenet of the law in this area that both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect aliens from the deprivation of life, liberty and property without due process of law.\" Attorneys today have used similar language to challenge her brother's immigration policies.\n\nMaryanne Trump Barry provided three reasons why it was unconstitutional to allow the government to deport an individual based on the Secretary of State declaring the person's presence or activities would have \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\"\n\nFirst, the provision was unconstitutional under the \"void-for-vagueness\" doctrine. She cited an earlier Supreme Court decision that noted, \"Living under a rule of law entails various suppositions, one of which is all persons are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands and forbids.\"\n\nThe judge cited the immigration provision and wrote, \"It simply cannot be disputed, and indeed the government does not, that the statute provides absolutely no notice to aliens as to what is required of them under the statute. Simply stated, it 'contains no standard for determining what a suspect has to do in order to satisfy' its requirements.\" (She cited Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358, 103 S. Ct. at 1858.)\n\nSecond, the judge wrote that the statute \"also deprives aliens such as plaintiff of due process of law by denying them a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\" In her opinion, U.S. District Judge Barry declared, \"The issue . . . is whether an alien who is in this country legally can, merely because he is here, have his liberty restrained and be forcibly removed to a specific country in the unfettered discretion of the Secretary of State and without any meaningful opportunity to be heard. The answer is a ringing 'no.'\"\n\nThird, the judge wrote that the statute represented an unconstitutional delegation of authority from Congress to the executive branch, giving the Secretary of State limitless authority in this area. \"Here, the government has offered no means of limiting the Secretary's authority . . . by reference to the text, related statutes, legislative history, or common understandings,\" according to U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry. \"Neither can this court conceive of a way to judicially circumscribe the discretion afforded to the Secretary so as to impose a 'recognized standard' upon the Secretary's otherwise 'totally unrestricted freedom of choice.'\"\n\n\"This court concludes that by leaving deportability determinations to the wholly unguided and unreviewable discretion of the Secretary of State, 241(a)(4)(C)(i) of the INA [later redesignated 237(a)(4)(C)(i)] represents an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power by which Congress eliminated the judiciary's constitutionally required function of review while abdicating its lawmaking responsibilities in favor of standardless executive discretion,\" wrote the judge.\n\nDonald Trump, Maryanne Trump, and Robert Trump during Opening of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal Casino on ... More April 5, 1990. (Photo by Ron Galella/Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)\n\nIn September 1999, Ruiz Massieu committed suicide following four years of house arrest. His death occurred two days before an arraignment on money laundering charges. His wife and authorities said he \"died from an overdose of antidepressants, derailing a trial that was likely to touch the highest echelons of power in Mexico and further tangle U.S.-Mexican relations,\" reported Newsweek .\n\nMaryanne Trump Barry retired from the federal bench in 2019. She passed away in November 2023. In July 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit overturned her decision in Massieu v. Reno for technical reasons unrelated to her constitutional arguments. \"We do not reach the merits of the constitutional questions decided by the district court,\" wrote Samuel Alito, now a Supreme Court Justice. \"Instead, we hold that the district lacked jurisdiction to entertain plaintiff's claims. . . . if plaintiff wished to challenge the efforts to deport him, he was required to exhaust available administrative remedies and then petition for review in this court.\"\n\nOn March 17, 2025, attorneys for Mahmoud Khalil, including the Center for Constitutional Rights and the ACLU Foundation, filed a motion for preliminary injunctive relief and named Donald Trump as one of the respondents. Khalil's lawyers did not include the opinion of U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry in their filing, unsurprising given the decision was overturned on technical grounds related to exhausting administrative remedies.\n\nHowever, the filing echoed a crucial argument in her opinion. \"Mr. Khalil is also likely to succeed on his claim that the challenged Policy does not satisfy due process because it is void for vagueness ,\" his attorneys wrote. \"The Policy, including as applied to Mr. Khalil, does not give the proper notice to anyone residing in the country which of their otherwise-lawful speech, opinions, beliefs, or advocacy will result in the government targeting them for detention and removal, and it provides government officials with unfettered discretion to target disfavored speech.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nThirty years ago, Donald Trump's sister may have crafted one of the strongest legal arguments against his immigration policy."

Minsky ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nUS President Donald Trump speaks during an event in the Oval Office of the White House in ... More Washington, DC, on March 21, 2025. Trump announced that he will transfer the federal student loan system from the Department of Education to the Small Business Association. (Photo by Annabelle Gordon / AFP) (Photo by ANNABELLE GORDON/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Friday unexpectedly announced that he would be moving the entire federal student loan system from the U.S. Department of Education to the Small Business Administration.\n\n\"I've decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, will handle will all of the student loan portfolio,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. The transfer will happen \"immediately,\" he said.\n\nTrump's statement comes one day after he issued an order to close the Department of Education - which most legal experts agree cannot be done without Congressional authorization. It also comes after the Trump administration made repeated assurances that the department would continue to administer the federal student loan system. Advocates have expressed heightened concerns that dismantling the Department of Education is likely illegal and will cause massive disruptions for federal student loan programs, including income-driven repayment plans and student loan forgiveness, which are already facing unprecedented turmoil.\n\nTrump's unexpected announcement that the federal student loan system would be moved to the Small Business Administration comes less than 24 hours after he issued an executive order to close the Department of Education.\n\n\"The Congress created the Department of Education in 1979 at the urging of President Jimmy Carter, who received a first-ever Presidential endorsement from the country's largest teachers' union shortly after pledging to the union his support for a separate Department of Education,\" reads the order . \"Since then, the Department of Education has entrenched the education bureaucracy and sought to convince America that Federal control over education is beneficial.\" The order goes on to say, \"Closing the Department of Education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them.\"\n\nAs the President was signing the order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters , \"When it comes to student loans and Pell Grants, those will still be run out of the Department of Education.\"\n\nSimilarly, the Department of Education issued a statement earlier this month announcing mass layoffs that said, \"The Department of Education will continue to deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency's purview, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, funding for special needs students, and competitive grantmaking.\"\n\nBut Trump's announcement on Friday directly contradicts those assurances.\n\nStudent loan borrower advocacy groups have been sounding the alarm that closing the Department of Education and transferring its operations to other agencies that have no experience with the nation's massive federal student loan portfolio may cause profound disruptions for borrowers.\n\n\"When the federal government accidentally bills a student loan borrower $5,000 a month instead of $50 - or when a predatory student loan servicer illegally withdraws multiple payments from debtors - there will be little to no recourse for working people to get their money back because of today's reckless decision by the Trump administration,\" said Braxton Brewington, spokesperson for the Debt Collective, a debtor's union advocating for student loan borrowers, in a statement on Thursday. \"Nearly every lawyer, ombudsman and team that was specifically designed to help the tens of millions of working class Americans with one of their largest monthly bills has been fired. This dismantling of the Department of Education will not save anyone a dime - in fact, it will come at great cost to our economy.\"\n\n\"History tells us that dismantling the Department of Education, ending programs that help students learn, and shuffling the remaining programs among other agencies won't fix anything,\" said Abby Shafroth, co-director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center in a statement this week. \"What it will do is eliminate education as a national priority; create inefficiency and disorder in federal educational programs; and make it harder for citizens to hold the federal government accountable for how it supports-or fails to support-access to education and educational excellence in the United States.\"\n\nBorrowers are already contending with significant problems across the vast federal student loan system. The SAVE plan, a new income-driven repayment program enacted by former President Joe Biden that provided reduced payments and an end to runaway interest accrual, remains blocked by a court order, resulting in millions of borrowers unable to pay their student loans. Earlier in March, the Department of Education abruptly shut down the income-driven repayment system by removing applications and issuing an order to loan servicers to halt all application processing. This has resulted in millions of borrowers being unable to enroll in repayment plans that they are legally entitled to access, while others have been cut off from student loan forgiveness programs such as PSLF or are experiencing massive spikes in monthly payments .\n\nMeanwhile, relief for borrowers suffering from medical impairments who are entitled to a discharge under federal law are unable to receive one as the Total and Permanent Disability discharge program remains in a \"paused\" status following a long-planned servicer platform change. It is unclear how President Trump's recent announcement of the transfer of the federal student loan system to the SBA will impact this program.\n\nThe Trump administration's actions to dismantle the Department of Education may lead to legal challenges. Congress established the Department of Education through legislation, and most legal experts agree that it would take an act of Congress to dismantle it. Similarly, federal laws passed by Congress specifically designate the Department of Education to administer and implement repayment and student loan forgiveness programs for federal borrowers; shifting the department's student loan operations to other agencies within the federal government may violate the law.\n\nSome advocacy organizations have already threatened to sue the Trump administration.\n\n\"The real effect of this Executive Order will be more hardship and chaos for students and families,\" said the National Student Legal Defense Network in a tweet on Friday. \"We will stop this in court.\"\n\n\"Moving the student loan program to the SBA is illegal, unserious, and a clear attempt to distract the public from the fact that Trump has broken the student loan system and is actively cheating millions of borrowers out of their rights,\" said Mike Pierce, Student Borrower Protection Center Executive Director, in a statement on Friday. \"Donald Trump, Linda McMahon, and Kelly Loeffler don't have to worry about whether they can afford to send their kids to college or how they will stay on top of their bills. The cruelty is the point, and they are intentionally stoking the flames of chaos that will impact the economic stability of millions of working families.\"\n\n\"First and foremost, Congressional approval is needed to transfer management of the loan portfolio to the SBA,\" said Jessica Thompson, Senior Vice President of The Institute of College Access & Success, in a statement on Friday. \"There is no discernible reason to do this. It will benefit neither borrowers nor taxpayers at large. Of further concern, the Administration today also announced a 40 percent staff reduction at SBA-on top of the 50 percent staff reduction that has already taken place at the Department of Education. With no clear strategy, the Administration has decimated staffing and oversight capabilities at both agencies while simultaneously announcing its intent to immediately transfer a more than $1.5 trillion loan portfolio between them. This can only result in borrowers experiencing erratic and inconsistent management of their federal student loans. Errors will prove costly to borrowers and ultimately, to taxpayers.\"\n\nThe Department of Education is already contending with several legal challenges over recent Trump administration actions. This week, the American Federation of Teachers filed a lawsuit over the department's decision to take down income-driven repayment plan applications and block new enrollments in affordable payment plans that the department is required under law to offer borrowers. And earlier this month, a group of Democratic-led states filed a legal challenge to halt the administration's efforts to lay off nearly half of the department's staff, including many that help run the federal student loan system.\n\nThe author has previously worked with the National Student Legal Defense Network on an unrelated matter. This article was updated on March 21, 2025 to include statements by the Student Borrower Protection Center and The Institute of College Access & Success on the announced student loan transfer to the SBA."

Trump issued an executive order putting the VOA's employees on administrative leave, effectively shutting down operations at Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Martí.\n\nFor decades, Voice of America has been a source of reliable information for people in countries without other access to journalism, with the VOA reaching a weekly audience of more than 354 million people via service in nearly 50 languages.\n\n\"Its news stories serve as a model of a free press and a vital source of information,\" writes Geoffrey Cowan in the Los Angeles Times . Cowan, a professor of communication and journalism at USC, said that \"when stories about rigged elections or government fraud or human rights abuses are suppressed by the countries where they occur, people in those countries can learn about them from VOA in their own languages and over transmission services they can receive. When people want to learn about how to run businesses, or about medical advances, democratic elections or popular culture, they can learn about them from VOA.\""

More Congress at the U.S. Capitol on March 04.\n\nProject 2025 includes a 900-page report proposing a total overhaul of the executive branch, which was crafted by the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups in 2023 as a roadmap for the next conservative president-namely Trump-to follow.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied having any involvement with Project 2025, after Democrats highlighted it as a key reason to vote against Trump in the election, and while there's no evidence he's explicitly following its proposals or has any plan to, many of the steps he's taken since his inauguration are in line with suggestions made in the policy blueprint.\n\nDEI: Trump has taken significant efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives throughout the government-and in the private sector-since taking office, signing multiple executive orders aimed at abolishing those programs, which mirrors Project 2025's calls for the next conservative president to \"eliminate every one of [the Biden administration's] wrongful and burdensome ideological projects,\" writing, \"Nondiscrimination and equality are the law; DEI is not.\"\n\nAmong the \"DEI\" policies Trump revoked is a 60-year old policy from 1965 that prohibited employment discrimination by government contractors and empowers the federal government to impose consequences for any discriminatory practices, which Project 2025 explicitly called to revoke, writing that abolishing the Lyndon B. Johnson-era executive order would mean contractors will \"be less subject to the changing political whims of a President that might impose significant new costs or burdens.\"\n\nBorder Security and Defense: Project 2025 is largely in line with Trump's broad moves to restrict immigration and tighten security on the southern border, with both the president and Project 2025 advocating increasing detention facilities for undocumented migrants, taking steps that would give local law enforcement more jurisdiction over identifying undocumented migrants, rescinding Biden-era immigration policies, restricting undocumented immigrants' abilities to receive public funds and restricting parole programs for migrants, among other moves.\n\nFederal Spending: The Trump administration's recent decision to broadly halt federal assistance , which it later walked back, echoes Project 2025's call for the president to \"use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government,\" saying, \"Anything short of that would constitute abject failure\"-a passage written by Vought, whom Trump tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget, which issued the funding pause memo.\n\nThe Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have more broadly aimed to cut spending throughout the federal government beyond its outside assistance, after Project 2025 claimed, \"Unaccountable federal spending is the secret lifeblood of the Great Awokening,\" alleging federal funds are used for \"nearly every power center held by the Left.\"\n\nFederal Workforce: The Trump administration has made substantial job cuts throughout the federal workforce through buyouts and mass firings, after Project 2025 advocated for a dramatically reduced federal government, arguing, \"the surest way to put the federal government back to work for the American people is to reduce its size and scope back to something resembling the original constitutional intent.\"\n\nAs part of its proposals for the federal workforce, Project 2025 strongly advocates for replacing career civil servants with political appointees dedicated to the president's agenda, and Trump has taken multiple steps toward that goal already, including reimplementing a \" Schedule F \" order that makes it easier to fire career officials, imposing a hiring freeze for career civil servants and restricting collective bargaining agreements for unionized workers-all of which Project 2025 suggested.\n\nBlocking Biden Funds: Trump's move to block government agencies from spending funds appropriated through Biden-era infrastructure and inflation bills is reflected in Project 2025, which said those laws should be repealed and it \"support[s] the rescinding of all funds not already spent by these programs.\"\n\nEducation: Trump is reportedly planning to abolish the Department of Education, with newly-confirmed Secretary of Education Linda McMahon telling staff the agency is undertaking a \"historic final mission\"-though he couldn't get rid of it unilaterally without Congress-after Project 2025 proposed getting rid of the agency, arguing, \"The future of education freedom and reform in the states is bright and will shine brighter when regulations and red tape from Washington are eliminated.\"\n\nTrump has also signed executive orders restricting funding for K-12 schools that \"indoctrinate\" students based on \"gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology,\" reflecting views espoused in Project 2025-though that proposal doesn't call for restricting funding-and an order for agencies to investigate how to implement policies that expand \"school choice,\" after Project 2025 called for the government to use federal funding to \"[empower] families to choose among a diverse set of education options.\"\n\nNOAA: One of Project 2025's proposals that gained widespread attention was that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-which handles weather monitoring, among other functions-should be dismantled and the National Weather Service should commercialize its weather forecasting, and while the Trump administration has not yet gone that far, it has reportedly fired hundreds of NOAA staffers and canceled leases at some weather forecasting centers, sparking fears that the cuts could affect preparedness and responses to future storms.\n\nClimate Change: Project 2025 proposed leaving the Paris Climate Agreement, which Trump did on his first day in office, and the president's broad proposals to roll back climate change policies is in line with Project 2025, which denounced the Biden administration's \"radical climate agenda\" and called for climate change efforts to be removed from governmental efforts like providing foreign aid and regulating agriculture.\n\nEnergy: Trump declared a \"national energy emergency\" and broadly took action against efforts on renewable energy, like the Biden administration''s pro-electric vehicle policies and federal wind energy projects -saying the U.S. should instead increase energy production through oil and gas drilling-after Project 2025 similarly claimed the U.S.' \"energy crisis is caused ... by extreme 'green' policies\" and said the next president \"must be committed to unleashing all of America's energy resources.\"\n\nTrump also created a \"National Energy Dominance Council\" in order to \"to make America energy dominant,\" after Project 2025 urged the next administration to \"prioritize energy and science dominance.\"\n\nAbortion: Though Trump has not taken broad steps to restrict abortion, as Project 2025 advocates, he did issue an executive order undoing Biden-era policies that weakened the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal dollars from being used on abortion, as Project 2025 advocated for, and reinstated the \" Mexico City Policy \" that prohibits non-governmental organizations receiving federal funds from performing or promoting abortion.\n\nForeign Policy: Trump signed an executive order calling for the secretary of state to put the agency's operations \"in line with an America First foreign policy,\" echoing Project 2025's calls for the State Department to \"ensur[e] that the interests of American citizens are given priority,\" and signed another order threatening punishments if State officials don't \"faithfully implement the President's policy,\" after Project 2025 called for the next administration to eliminate the \"tug of war\" between the president and career officials and overhaul the agency \"into a lean and functional diplomatic machine that serves the President.\"\n\nTrump's executive order to sanction countries that refuse to go along with his hardline immigration policies-which led to a trade standoff with Colombia over whether the country would accept deported migrants-also reflects Project 2025, which says the executive branch should \"quickly and aggressively address recalcitrant countries' failure to accept deportees by imposing stiff sanctions until deportees are in fact accepted for return (not just promised to be taken).\"\n\nWorld Health Organization: Project 2025 denounced the World Health Organization before Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the public health institution, with Project 2025 authors claiming the WHO's \"manifest failure and corruption ... during the COVID-19 pandemic\" posed \"danger ... to U.S. citizens and interests,\" and the U.S. \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response\" to any international organizations that purportedly threaten its interests, \"up to and including withdrawal.\"\n\nGlobal Organizations: Project 2025 broadly said the next administration \"must end blind support for international organizations\" and \"seriously consider\" withdrawing from groups \"that no longer have value, quietly undermine U.S. interests or goals, or disproportionately rely on U.S. financial contributions to survive\"-foreshadowing Trump's executive order to remove the U.S. from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), stop providing funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and review the U.S.'s involvement in the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nTransgender Rights: Trump's moves against transgender rights include ordering the government to only recognize Americans' sex at birth, banning federal prisons from classifying inmates based on their gender identity, reinstating his ban on transgender Americans from serving in the military and restricting gender-affirming care for minors, after Project 2025 broadly called for gender ideology and identity to be removed from government policies and for the transgender military ban to be reinstated.\n\nTrump also signed an order rescinding federal funding from school programs that allow transgender women to participate in women's sports, after Project 2025 decried the federal government \"forc[ing] school districts to undermine girls' sports and parents' rights to satisfy transgender extremists.\"\n\nRefugees: Trump suspended refugee admissions in an executive order on his first day, after Project 2025 said the \"federal government's obligation to shift ... essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions.\"\n\nSanctuary Cities: Trump signed multiple executive orders saying the government should try to block \"sanctuary cities\" or areas that offer greater protections to undocumented immigrants from receiving federal funding, after Project 2025 said Congress should \"set financial disincentives\" for areas that implement \"sanctuary\" policies.\n\nDeath Penalty: Trump directed his attorney general to pursue the death penalty where applicable-as in Project 2025, which says the federal government should \"enforce the death penalty where appropriate and applicable\"-and actually went even further than Project 2025, saying the death penalty should be imposed in crimes involving the murder of law enforcement officers and capital offenses committed by undocumented immigrants, \"regardless of other factors.\"\n\nSecurity Clearances: Trump signed an executive order giving security clearances to any individual designated by the White House counsel to receive one, rather than waiting for the full background check process to be completed, with Project 2025 also decrying the \"extraordinary delays\" caused by the clearance process.\n\nProject 2025 also backed up Trump's decision to revoke many former government officials' security clearances, saying the next president \"should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former ... senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media\" without prior authorization.\n\nFEMA: Project 2025 proposed the Federal Emergency Management Agency should be moved to the Department of the Interior and reformed-which Trump suggested he may do, saying he will sign an order to \"begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA, or maybe getting rid of them,\" while his administration has also cut jobs at the disaster relief agency.\n\nThe policy proposal also supports Trump's suggestion he could refuse to give FEMA funds to areas that oppose him politically, with Project 2025 arguing FEMA grants should only go to areas that \"can show that their mission and actions support the broader homeland security mission\"-though Project 2025 specifies that wouldn't include disaster relief funding, while Trump has suggested he could also withhold those funds.\n\nMilitary Policies: Trump reinstated members of the military who were discharged for not complying with its COVID-19 vaccine mandate, as Project 2025 urged, and also signed an order ending DEI programs in the military, after Project 2025 called for the military to \"eliminate Marxist indoctrination and divisive critical race theory programs and abolish newly established diversity, equity, and inclusion offices and staff.\"\n\nFederal Regulations: Trump has signed executive orders imposing a cap on federal regulations and directing agencies to identify puportedly \"unlawful\" regulations, after Project 2025 broadly denounced the \"administrative state\" and advocated for \"reining in the regulatory state and ensuring that regulations achieve important benefits while imposing minimal burdens on Americans.\"\n\nIRS: The Internal Revenue Service is reportedly planning to slash half of its workforce, after already laying off approximately 7,000 workers in earlier job cuts, gutting an agency that Project 2025 referred to as \"a poorly managed, utterly unresponsive and increasingly politicized agency\" which requires \"meaningful reform.\"\n\nStudent Loans: Trump signed an order that seeks to limit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program for public servants and has suggested he wants to abolish the Education Department and move the office that handles student loans to a different agency-echoing plans outlined in Project 2025, which calls for the Office of Student Aid to be moved to the Treasury Department and for the federal government to end all student loan forgiveness, criticizing the public service program for \"prioritiz[ing] government and public sector work over private sector employment.\"\n\nTransportation Security Administration: The Department of Homeland Security ended its collective bargaining agreement with unionized TSA workers-with the union now going to court in an effort to restore the agreement-after Project 2025 suggested the TSA should be privatized entirely or a new \"government corporation\" should be established to run TSA outside the scope of Homeland Security.\n\nDefense Production Act: Trump signed an executive order March 14 that revoked a number of Biden-era directives invoking the Defense Production Act-which expedites the manufacturing of various products-for infant formula and \"green energy\" technology like solar panels, after Project 2025 criticized overuse of the Defense Production Act and said it should only be invoked \"in the gravest circumstances.\"\n\nDans, the former president of Project 2025 who resigned before the election, praised the Trump administration's policy moves in an interview with Politico , saying what Trump is doing in office is \"actually way beyond my wildest dreams.\" \"What we had hoped would happen has happened,\" Dans told Politico when asked if he would have handled anything differently, given the controversy Project 2025 garnered. \"So I can't imagine how anything could end really any better.\"\n\nWhile many of his policies in office line up with priorities outlined in Project 2025, Trump has publicly disavowed Project 2025 and has not changed his stance since taking office. There's no indication he's actually following Project 2025's playbook now, as there's always been significant overlap between his personal policy agenda and what Project 2025 has proposed, though Reuters reported ahead of the inauguration that the Heritage Foundation was among the groups providing draft executive orders to Trump's transition team. Trump has not yet given any suggestion that he's planning on imposing some of Project 2025's more controversial sweeping measures, like abolishing the Department of Homeland Security, taking broad steps to restrict abortion or applying a baseline tax rate. Dans denied Trump was in any way working with Project 2025 or specifically following it in his interview with Politico, saying that while \"directionally\" Project 2025 and Trump's agenda \"have a lot in common ... so do great minds.\" Trump \"absolutely told the truth\" in distancing himself from Project 2025, Dans claimed, saying the policy project \"was done outside of President Trump.\"\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump spokesperson Harris Fields said Trump \"had nothing to do with Project 2025.\" \"In his first few days in office, President Trump has delivered on the promises that earned him a resounding mandate from the American people - securing the border, restoring common sense, driving down inflation, and unleashing American energy,\" Fields said.\n\nTrump's policies since taking office also have some significant differences from what Project 2025 outlines. Most notably, one of Trump's first acts in office was to pause the federal ban on TikTok while his administration tries to negotiate a way for parent company ByteDance to divest from it, while Project 2025 calls for banning the app. Trump's call for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants also goes beyond what's proposed in Project 2025, which calls for broad-scale immigration reforms and strengthened border security, but does not explicitly endorse widescale deportations. While Project 2025 proposes narrowing pathways to legal immigration and moving away from what it terms a \"system that favors extended family-based and luck-of-the-draw immigration,\" Project 2025 also does not call for ending birthright citizenship , as Trump has ordered. (His executive order abolishing birthright citizenship has been temporarily blocked in court .) Trump also is going further than Project 2025 on restricting foreign aid with his moves to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development-while Project 2025 only called for \"reforming\" USAID and \"scal[ing] back USAID's global footprint\"-and has spoke of getting rid of purported \"fraud\" in the Social Security Administration , which Project 2025 does not discuss. Various Trump proposals reflecting culture war issues, like making English the national language, eliminating the federal government's use of paper straws and signing an executive order dedicated to \"eradicating anti-Christian bias\" are also not reflected in Project 2025.\n\nMultiple high-level officials and nominees in Trump's second administration played a role in crafting Project 2025, including Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr, senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro, Securities and Exchange Commission head Paul Atkins and Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan. Carr and Navarro each authored sections of Project 2025's policy blueprint, while Atkins and Homan are listed as contributors. Trump also nominated Aaron Szabo, a contributor to Project 2025's section on the Environmental Protection Agency, to serve as the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation. Most notably, Trump nominated Vought to serve as the head of the Office of Management and Budget after Vought reportedly previously served as a key architect of Project 2025. He authored the policy proposal's chapter on the Executive Office of the President of the United States and reportedly spearheaded the project's playbook for Trump's first 180 days. Vought was confirmed by the Senate in a party line 53-47 vote Feb. 6, after Democrats spoke on the Senate floor overnight in protest of his confirmation. NBC News reports the Trump transition team also used a LinkedIn-style database of federal staffers that Project 2025 compiled to help recruit lower level administration staffers.\n\nOne of the central features of Project 2025's policy blueprint is a heavy influence on nuclear families and supporting the nuclear family, with a goal of boosting marriage and birth rates, such as through restrictions on abortion. Vice President JD Vance, a close ally of the Heritage Foundation who has long espoused similar views about promoting marriage and birth rates, called at the anti-abortion rights March for Life rally in January for there to be \"more babies in the United States of America,\" arguing, \"The benchmark of national success is not our GDP number or our stock market, but whether people feel that they can raise thriving and healthy families in our country.\" \"It is the task of our government to make it easier for young moms and dads to afford to have kids, to bring them into the world and to welcome them as the blessings that we know they are here at the March for Life,\" Vance said. Trump's Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy also issued guidance Thursday dedicated to \"advancing President Donald Trump's agenda to rescind woke policies\" and \"roll back burdensome and costly regulations.\" That guidance includes a provision saying the department should prioritize giving grants to \"communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average.\"\n\nProject 2025 proposes a broad overhaul of the executive branch aimed at making it more aligned with conservative ideologies, and giving the president more power. In addition to proposals that would get rid of climate change efforts, rescind LGBTQ rights-centered policies, replace career civil servants with political appointees and impose an \"America First\" foreign policy outlook-as Trump is now to some extent adopting-the policy blueprint also makes a number of other bold policy suggestions, such as abolishing numerous government agencies, banning pornography and overhauling the Federal Reserve, proposing to do so through such measures as returning to the gold standard or getting rid of the government's control over the U.S.' money entirely. Project 2025 also proposes imposing a baseline tax rate-of 15% for anyone under the Social Security wage base of approximately $168,000, or 30% for those earning more than that-and lowering the corporate tax rate to 18%. It suggests making significant cuts to Medicaid and imposing work requirements to receive benefits, as well as making the paid Medicare Advantage program, which is now an alternative to regular Medicare, the default option for patients, among numerous other moves.\n\nTrump's administration is still less than two months old, and it remains to be seen what steps he'll take going forward that could line up-or go against-Project 2025. Trump's Health Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not rule out at his confirmation hearing the possibility the Trump administration could revoke approvals for abortion drug mifepristone , as Project 2025 proposes, saying only that Trump \"has asked me to study the safety of mifepristone\" and \"Whatever [Trump] does, I will implement those policies.\" Trump previously told CBS News the abortion drug-which studies have overwhelmingly shown is broadly safe and effective-\"is going to be available,\" when asked before the election whether he would ban it, walking back his previous suggestion during an August press conference that he could be open to restricting it.\n\nWhile Project 2025 became best known for its 900-page policy blueprint, the project also included creating a playbook for Trump's first 180 days in office. Unlike the policy blueprint, that playbook was never made public, with Vought telling journalists from the Centre for Climate Reporting-who obtained secret footage of the Project 2025 architect by posing as potential donors-that it was by design. The 180-day playbook is \"very, very closely held,\" Vought said in the secret footage, and Micah Meadowcroft, a Vought aide also working on Project 2025, told the undercover journalists the group was intentionally keeping the playbook a secret. Those efforts included ensuring staffers knew the plans before Trump entered office, so that they wouldn't have to converse over government work emails that would be subject to public disclosure rules. It's still unknown what that playbook says and whether Trump is now implementing it in office.\n\nProject 2025 's policy blueprint was initially released in 2023, part of what the Heritage Foundation has said is a long tradition of the organization crafting policy proposals for incoming GOP presidents that dates back to Ronald Reagan. Though the agenda had already been out for months, it only started garnering widespread attention last summer, ahead of the election, as Democrats started pushing the 900-page document and its policies as a key reason to oppose Trump, causing Trump to publicly denounce the plan. Trump claimed on Truth Social in July he has \"nothing to do with [Project 2025],\" has \"no idea\" who's behind the plan and finds some of its ideas \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal\"-even as Trump has long had significant ties to the Heritage Foundation and many of the document's contributors worked in Trump's first administration. The policy proposal continued to remain controversial within the Trump team through the election, with Trump's campaign manager Chris LaCivita calling the effort a \"pain in the ass\" for the Trump campaign and Trump transition head Howard Lutnick-now Trump's Commerce Secretary-publicly claiming he would blacklist people involved with Project 2025 from working in the second administration.\n\nOne Community.

      "text": "Trump's Presidency And Student Loans: What Move To Small Business Administration Means For Borrowers\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced Friday he plans to move the federal student loans portfolio from the Department of Education to the Small Business Administration (SBA), the biggest of several steps his administration is taking that affects how the government handles federal student loans and student loan forgiveness.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs an executive in the Oval Office at the White House on February 14 in ... More Washington, DC.\n\nDepartment of Education Dismantling: Trump said Friday the Office of Student Aid would be moved to SBA \"immediately,\" after the president signed an executive order Thursday to \"greatly minimize the agency\"-but initially said federal student loans and Pell Grants would remain under the Education Department.\n\nThe changeover to a different agency is not expected to affect borrowers' loans themselves, but there could be a period in which it would be difficult to get applications processed, or a greater number of errors in the system as accounts are transferred over, experts told NBC 10 Philadelphia, and borrowers are advised to keep records of their loans and previous payments.\n\nIt's still unclear what the move could look like in practice: Legal experts and Democrats in Congress have said Trump can't move the student loan portfolio without congressional approval, which suggests the issue could be litigated in court, and sources at the Office of Student Aid told Inside Higher Ed on Friday they were \"blindsided\" by the move to SBA and hadn't received any directives on how the changeover would work.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon told Fox News on Friday she was speaking to SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler about a \"strategic plan\" on moving over the student loans program, and Loeffler said on X on Friday she was \"prepared to work with Congress and the Administration to bring accountability back to America's student loan program,\" though she did not specify what that \"accountability\" entailed.\n\nDepartment of Education Job Cuts: The Education Department previously announced it plans to lay off approximately 50% of its workforce and shutter some offices, after approximately a quarter of the Office of Student Aid's employees had already previously been laid off or accepted buyouts, according to CNN , and it's unclear whether Trump's order Thursday could further exacerbate downsizing that affects student loans.\n\nThe job cuts could hamper the agency's ability to process payments or to manage a potential increase in defaults as some affordable payment plans end, CNN notes, with a former Education Department staffer telling the outlet that workers who would typically write emails warning borrowers before they default \"have been fired,\" adding, \"It's almost like the government doesn't even want to get paid.\"\n\nIt's also unclear what staffing could look like if the Office of Student Aid moves over to the SBA, as Loeffler announced Friday the agency will cut 43% of its staff.\n\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness: Trump signed an executive order March 7 that seeks to limit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which allows public servants to be eligible for loan forgiveness after 10 years of service, saying in his order that employees who work for organizations opposed to his policies-like groups that support transgender rights or undocumented immigrants-should not be eligible for the loan forgiveness.\n\nTrump's executive order targeting the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program only seeks proposed revisions to the program at this time, and requires Congressional approval, so borrowers who are public servants are not yet affected.\n\nThe Biden-era plan to allow lower monthly payments based on borrowers' income appears finished; the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan was blocked in federal court in February and the Trump administration is unlikely to try to revive it, with one staffer at the Office of Student Aid telling CNN, \"We've been told 'SAVE' is not coming back in any way, shape, or form.\" The Trump administration also paused applications to other income-driven repayment plans for at least three months, according to a memo obtained by The Washington Post , and suggested other plans based on borrowers' incomes could also be unlawful. The Education Department's lawyers will decide when the applications will reopen, CNN reported, noting any income-driven plans that come back \"are expected to be more costly for borrowers.\"\n\nThe Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency are taking steps to dismantle the CFPB, a consumer protection agency that's taken numerous steps against predatory behavior by student loan companies, with the Student Borrower Protection Center reporting the agency has obtained more than $5 billion in relief for Americans with student debt and taken steps that have led to the Department of Education canceling $188.8 billion in debt for borrowers. The Trump administration appears to be halting the agency's work on investigating student loan issues: It fired the CFPB's student loan ombudsman as part of cuts to the agency's workforce-a move that the former ombudsman, Julia Barnard, said in a statement would \"cost real people real money\"-and withdrew a lawsuit against a Pennsylvania-based loan servicer, which the Biden administration alleged unlawfully collected student loans that borrowers had discharged when filing for bankruptcy.\n\nColleen Campbell, the executive director of the Office of Student Aid's Office of Loan Portfolio Management, said in a public LinkedIn post in February announcing her new role that the change was \"somewhat bittersweet,\" noting she had already lost \"many\" of the employees she oversees, with \"more to come.\" \"I'm afraid of what the coming days, weeks, months, years will bring not just for me and the Department, but for the borrowers we serve,\" Campbell wrote. \"I've dedicated my career to the work of supporting college affordability and a student aid system that supports our most vulnerable, and it is heartbreaking to see that dissolving before my eyes.\" In an updated post on LinkedIn Wednesday, Campbell announced she had opted to leave the Education Department.\n\nIt's still unclear what other impacts student loan borrowers could face, though more programs could be under threat, both from the Trump administration and Congress' Republican majority. A number of student loan programs have been identified as being under review , both by the White House -when it froze federal spending, though that's since been blocked in court-and in a memo from the GOP-controlled House Ways and Means Committee. The reviews include potentially capping the amount of student loans the government can issue, phasing out loan programs covering graduate students and borrowers' parents, modifying Pell Grants and ending Biden-era programs that provide student loan forgiveness to borrowers who were defrauded by their school or whose schools closed. Lawmakers also suggested they were looking into ending a tax deduction for interest on student loans and subsidies that prevent borrowers from paying interest while they're still in school. None of those changes have been formalized yet, however, and it's unclear if any will ultimately end up happening.\n\n43 million. That's the approximate number of Americans who had outstanding federal student loans as of fiscal year 2024, according to the Department of Education.\n\nOne major source of concern for borrowers since Trump's inauguration is whether Musk and his associates at DOGE have access to borrowers' private student loan data , as reports have indicated. A federal judge blocked DOGE's access to some Education Department data in a ruling Feb. 24, in response to a lawsuit brought by unions representing federal workers, student loan recipients and veterans who receive benefits or have student loans. That ruling bars the Education Department from sharing private information about the plaintiffs in the case with DOGE officials, and is only temporary until a more lasting order can be issued, however. A different judge previously denied a more sweeping effort by students in the University of California system to block DOGE from accessing student loan data. That ruling is only temporary while the litigation moves forward, however, so a different ruling against DOGE could still be issued in the future. That means DOGE reportedly does have some access to data as of now, though it's still unclear the full scope of what officials have accessed and how any information is being used.\n\nThe reports on DOGE accessing student loan data sparked a number of claims on social media that borrowers should use Musk's access to their data to try and have their loans forgiven, claiming DOGE violated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and borrowers have the right to challenge their loans in response. There's no factual basis for those claims, however. FERPA, which broadly prohibits educational institutions from disclosing students' personal school records without their or their parents' consent, doesn't have any private right of action, which means students or borrowers cannot bring lawsuits under the law if they believe their private information has been shared. While it is possible to file a complaint with the government alleging a FERPA violation, those claims will be investigated and enforced by the Education Department-which is unlikely to find any fault or grant relief in this case, given that the department is managed by Trump appointees. Even if any violations were found, the law doesn't allow for any financial relief to students or borrowers, and instead only says the school or institution that disclosed the information should have their funding revoked.\n\nTrump has publicly distanced himself from the far-right policy blueprint Project 2025, and there is no indication he is following its proposals directly. Many of Trump's actions in office have lined up with policies proposed in Project 2025 , however, including the dismantling of the Education Department. Project 2025 proposes the Office of Student Aid should be moved to the Treasury Department if the Education Department is abolished, though it would only oversee collections and defaults of loans. Most of the federal student loan portfolio should be spun off into a new \"government corporation\" that would be managed by a board of presidentially appointed trustees, Project 2025 proposed. The policy agenda does not advocate for any form of student loan forgiveness, writing, \"Borrowers should expect to repay their loans.\"\n\nStudent loans and debt relief have become a growing political issue, as Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have encouraged full student loan forgiveness and made the issue into a central concern for Democrats. The Biden administration imposed a sweeping plan to forgive up to $10,000 of borrowers' student loans, but the Supreme Court ultimately struck down the policy, ruling in June 2023 the administration exceeded its authority in imposing it. As a result, the Biden administration instead made a series of more targeted moves on student loan forgiveness that focused on specific groups of borrowers, saying in January it had approved $188.8 billion in loan forgiveness for 5.3 million borrowers during Joe Biden's presidency. Republicans have ramped up their opposition to student loan forgiveness as a result of Democrats' advocacy for it, with Republican attorneys general filing the lawsuits that ultimately led courts to strike down Biden's most sweeping proposals, like the universal debt relief plan and the SAVE plan.\n\nOne Community.

      "text": "Could Trump Officials Be Prosecuted? What To Know After Judge Finds Evidence Of Criminal Contempt For El Salvador Flights\n\nJudge James Boasberg ruled Wednesday the Trump administration likely committed criminal contempt by flying migrants to El Salvador despite a court order forbidding it, raising questions about what consequences Trump officials could face for ignoring court rulings-and whether President Donald Trump's pardon power could help negate any potential punishments.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi (L) talks with Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a meeting of ... More governors at the White House on February 21.\n\nBoasberg ruled Wednesday there's sufficient evidence to suggest the Trump administration \"willfully disobeyed\" his March 15 order, which barred the Trump administration from deporting migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe Trump administration announced on March 16 that flights deporting more than 200 people to El Salvador had already taken off before Boasberg ruled and the judge lost jurisdiction over the flights once they left U.S. airspace, but Boasberg struck down those arguments Wednesday.\n\nBoasberg said the government's argument intentionally mischaracterized his \"clear and unequivocal\" ruling stating the Trump administration could not let the migrants leave U.S. custody, regardless of whether or not they had already left the country.\n\nBoasberg's ruling was the first formal ruling stating the Trump administration likely intentionally violated a court order, teeing up the possibility that he-or other judges in the future-could punish specific Trump officials for contempt of court as a result of defying their rulings, though Trump himself remains immune from facing both criminal or civil liability for his acts in office..\n\nBoasberg suggested Wednesday he intends to try and hold administration officials in criminal contempt-in which defendants are subject to criminal prosecution as a result of their defiance of the court-but other courts could decide to hold officials in civil contempt, which means they would face civil penalties like fines or imprisonment to force them to comply with rulings.\n\nBut Trump could help lessen the blow of any criminal punishments: Trump's DOJ wouldn't necessarily prevent officials from facing criminal penalties, as private lawyers could be appointed to prosecute any contempt allegations, but the president likely still would be able to pardon anyone convicted of contempt, legal experts told Forbes.\n\nPlaintiffs in other cases have raised similar concerns, particularly in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a legal immigrant whom the Trump administration has admitted it deported to El Salvador due to an administrative error, as Garcia's attorneys have asked Judge Paula Xinis to hold the government in contempt for not complying with a Supreme Court ruling ordering the White House to facilitate Garcia's return to the U.S.\n\nBoasberg said Wednesday the Trump administration must say by April 23 whether or not they plan to try and erase the contempt charges. If they do want to try and comply now with Boasberg's March 15 ruling, the government must say by April 23 what steps it's taking to do so, which the judge noted would most likely be by transporting the migrants it deported to El Salvador back into U.S. custody. If they don't want to do that, the government will have to submit sworn declarations by April 23 indicating which specific officials were responsible for making the decisions to keep the flights going to El Salvador, rather than turn them around in compliance with Boasberg's order. Boasberg would then move forward with prosecuting those officials for contempt. The Trump administration, for its part, said Wednesday it will \"immediately\" appeal Boasberg's contempt ruling, though it's unclear when an appeals court could rule on the issue.\n\nJudges hold parties in civil contempt in order to compel them to comply with a court's action, imposing consequences designed to force them to follow the court. Any penalties levied are \"coercive, not punitive,\" Frank Bowman, a former federal prosecutor and professor at the University of Missouri Law School, told Forbes in an email, noting that could include consequences like levying escalating fines on a party or putting them in prison until they comply. Those punishments go away as soon as they follow the court, which Bowman notes means, \"If a Trump aide does something contemptuous that can't be undone, the civil remedy may be useless.\" Criminal contempt is instead used to punish someone for acting in defiance of a court, rather than get them to comply. That's a formal criminal charge that is punishable under federal law in most cases by up to $1,000 in fines or up to six months in prison.\n\nThe Trump-controlled Justice Department is unlikely to prosecute any of the administration's own officials for contempt, particularly for defying court orders in cases the agency itself is handling in court. But that doesn't necessarily stop Trump aides from being prosecuted. Federal law states contempt charges should be prosecuted by the government, \"unless the interest of justice requires the appointment of another attorney.\" That means if the government refuses to prosecute someone-as the Trump administration likely would-the court would then appoint a different attorney to prosecute the contempt charges. Doing so would be \"relatively novel at a trial court in a criminal case,\" Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor and professor at University of St. Thomas School of Law, told Forbes, noting the more common scenario is private attorneys taking over for the DOJ in civil cases they withdraw from in appeals courts. Boasberg noted in his ruling Wednesday he would appoint an outside prosecutor should the Trump administration refuse.\n\nTrump cannot pardon anyone who's held in civil contempt of court, which Bowman told Forbes makes that \"the only contempt remedy that could be effective\" for levying punishments on Trump officials. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, suggested in a recent letter to Trump the president could have difficulty pardoning any aides for criminal contempt as well, claiming the president may be \"unable to pardon a federal employee\" for contempt \"because such an offense may not qualify as an 'offense against the United States.'\" (The Constitution gives presidents the \"Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States.\") Some legal scholars have also questioned the pardon power for criminal contempt more broadly, protesting Trump's pardon of Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio for contempt during his first presidency by claiming pardons for contempt unlawfully undermine the judicial branch. Judges need to be able to have the power to punish people for contempt in order for the court system to effectively function, the thinking goes, with scholars also arguing it violates the separation of powers between branches of government. That suggests any pardons Trump does make could be challenged in court, leaving it up to judges to decide whether the moves are allowed. Bowman disputed there would be any legal issues with Trump pardoning aides for contempt, however, telling Forbes about the legal arguments against contempt pardons, \"I don't think they fly.\" \"Presidents have issued many pardons for contempt since at least the 1800s, and the Supreme Court has specifically held that criminal contempt can be pardoned,\" Bowman noted.\n\nWhile his aides could be punished for defying any court rulings, Trump himself is shielded from facing any criminal or civil penalties for acts he takes as part of his duties in office. The Justice Department has long had a policy not to prosecute sitting presidents on any kind of criminal charges, and the Supreme Court last year extended that immunity to say Trump and other presidents also cannot face criminal charges after they leave office for actions that were part of their official presidential duties. That means if Trump were to act against a court order by doing something that was within his official capacity as president, it would be up to Congress to impeach him and remove him from office, versus him possibly facing charges in court. Trump also can't face any civil punishments for his official duties, as the Supreme Court similarly ruled in Nixon v. Fitzgerald that presidents can't be held liable in civil cases for actions they undertook as part of their official duties.\n\nThe possibility that Trump or his aides could defy court rulings has become a growing fear among critics of the president in the months since he took office, as judges have increasingly imposed rulings blocking his policies. Those rulings have led to outcry by Trump and his allies that judges are abusing their power and don't have the authority to overrule the president's actions, with Vice President JD Vance saying in February judges \"aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power\" and GOP lawmakers filing longshot articles of impeachment against judges who issue unfavorable rulings. Boasberg 's March 15 ruling has become a flashpoint in that debate, as reports suggest Trump officials intentionally ignored the judge's ruling by not turning around the flights to El Salvador, believing Boasberg couldn't control flights that were already in the air. Garcia's case has further compounded fears among Trump critics that the White House will defy the rule of law, as the government has declined to give any indication they intend to facilitate Garcia's return to the U.S. as the Supreme Court requested-instead just claiming their hands are tied because he's now under El Salvador's jurisdiction. Trump officials have broadly denied they've intentionally violated any court rulings, and have also taken pains in other cases to note the government is complying with rulings that it doesn't like. Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in March he \"never did defy a court order\" and suggested he didn't intend to going forward, saying, \"No, you can't do that.\"\n\nOne Community. Many Voices.

More in Milwaukee in July 2024. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\nRenatus Tactical Acquisition Corp I, a special purpose acquisition company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, is looking to raise at least $179 million through both an initial public offering and private placement, funds it plans to use to acquire another business.\n\nThe firm's leadership has deep ties to President Donald Trump's media company: Renatus Tactical CEO Eric Swider is a Trump Media board member and led the company that merged with it; Devin Nunes, CEO, president and chair of Trump Media, also chairs Renatus Tactical's board; and Alexander Cano, Renatus Tactical's COO, was president and secretary of the firm that merged with Trump Media.\n\nRenatus Tactical is targeting acquisitions in the cryptocurrency and blockchain, data security, and dual-use technology sectors, industries with heavy government involvement as regulators or major clients, according to its SEC filing.\n\nTrump appointees lead the SEC, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission, agencies that oversee regulatory and legal reviews of mergers.\n\nSwider, Nunes and spokespeople for Trump Media did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNunes, Swider and Cano were all deeply involved in the drama-filled merger between Trump Media and Digital World that made Trump's media company and Truth Social platform public. Nunes resigned from Congress to lead Trump Media in January 2022, while Swider was a board member of Digital World when it first registered with the SEC in 2021. Cano also was with Digital World in 2021, starting off as the contact person for investor relations. The merger was announced in October 2021. But the deal wasn't approved until March 2024. In the intervening 29 months, the SEC charged a former Digital World board member and two others with insider trading related to the company (the board member was later found guilty, while the two other people pleaded guilty); Digital World was forced to admit that two years' worth of financial statements were unreliable and that it was at risk of being delisted from Nasdaq for failing to file a mandatory report; and Digital World agreed to pay the SEC $18 million to settle fraud charges for \"making material misrepresentations\" in its filings for entering merger discussions with Trump Media prior to its IPO. After the merger was completed, the turmoil continued: two Trump Media cofounders sued the company, alleging it diluted their ownership stakes, prompting Trump Media to counter sue , claiming the cofounders had \"failed spectacularly at every turn.\" And Trump Media was forced to change auditors after the SEC charged its accountant, BF Borgers, with \"massive fraud\" involving more than 250 clients (Borgers agreed to pay a $12 million fine and an industry ban).\n\nWe don't know. While the company's registration said it plans to focus its search for a merger target in the cryptocurrency and blockchain, data security and dual use technologies markets, the company can pursue an acquisition in any industry.\n\n$178,942,500: The amount Renatus Tactical hopes to raise, selling 17.5 million shares to the public at $10 each and 3,942,500 warrants at $1 a piece in a private placement.\n\n\"The current administration has taken unprecedented steps to integrate digital assets into the national financial strategy,\" Renatus Tactical stated in its SEC filing, explaining its focus on the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector.\n\nTrump's connection to the founders of Renatus Tactical may not be entirely beneficial for the company. In its risk disclosures, the company warns that \"third parties may not want to engage with us to provide services due to the affiliation of our management team and our board of directors with TMTG and President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi consulted for Renatus LLC, a separate company also founded by Eric Swider, and received $3 million worth of Digital World shares for her services.\n\nFuture SEC filings that could reveal additional Trump Media insiders involved with Renatus Tactical.\n\nDevin Nunes pulled in $47 million as CEO of Trump Media in 2024-earning a $1 million base salary, $600,000 bonus, $44.1 million in stock awards, and $1.2 million in additional stock compensation.\n\nDonald Trump is worth about $4.8 billion, with Trump Media shares making up the bulk of his fortune.\n\nIn November 2023, Trump Media sued 20 media outlets, including Forbes, for reporting that included calculations of its financial results while still a private company. The defendants have moved to dismiss the claims.\n\nTrump Media Paid Donald Trump Jr. Nearly A Quarter Of Its Annual Revenue.

I think we'll have a couple of alternatives,\" Bannon told NewsNation's \" CUOMO \" when asked how Trump could overcome term limits. \"We'll see what the definition of term limit is.\"\n\nBannon expressed confidence in this effort, comparing it to Trump's 2024 comeback .\n\n\"I'm a firm believer that President Trump will run and win again in 2028,\" Bannon said. \"We've had greater long shots than Trump 2028.\" He added that they're \"not prepared to talk about it publicly, but in a couple of months, I think we will be.\"\n\nWhen pressed on whether he was suggesting revolution or overthrow, Bannon rejected that characterization, describing himself as a \"huge believer in democracy\" while claiming the country is experiencing a \"1932-type realignment\" comparable to the FDR era.\n\n\"We're in the middle of a 1932-type realignment if we can continue to have populist nationalist policies,\" Bannon said. \"We have African-Americans coming to our side. We have Hispanics coming to our side.\"\n\nHe described the current administration's actions as a \"revolution of common sense to deconstruct the administrative state\" and claimed anti-democratic forces are working through the courts to \"obstruct a sitting president\" from fulfilling his executive mandate.\n\nBannon defended Elon Musk's role in implementing the Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE.\n\nHe acknowledged having \"huge, almost unbridgeable differences\" with Musk on issues including \"transhumanism and technology and visas and immigration,\" but praised Musk's support for their efforts.\n\n\"He backed our play,\" Bannon said, mentioning Musk contributed financially to their voter outreach and supported the merger of \"Bobby Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again with MAGA.\"\n\nBannon described Musk's DOGE initiative as deploying \"shock troops\" in a \"trauma-inducing effort into the administrative state\" that, while \"not pretty,\" has been \"pretty effective.\"\n\nBannon criticized federal judges who have blocked administration policies, particularly regarding immigration enforcement, calling for their impeachment.\n\n\"More of these radical, neo-Marxist judges that are working in coordination ought to be impeached,\" Bannon said, referring specifically to a judge who halted deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump invoked.\n\nHe accused the judge of \"stepping into President Trump's role\" as commander-in-chief and \"making command decisions that a military commander would make.\"\n\nWhen questioned on how patriotism aligns with attacking government institutions , Bannon responded that reforming institutions was central to Trump's mandate.\n\n\"The American people understand that our institutions have to be either purged or they have to be reformed,\" Bannon said, \"everything from the Justice Department to the FBI to the intelligence community to the Pentagon, across the board.\""

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has received a boost in his approval ratings, with recent polls showing positive shifts in public perception.\n\nTrump's approval rating is a key indicator of his political strength as he navigates his second presidential term and prepares for future policy battles.\n\nA shift in his numbers could influence support from Republican lawmakers, affect his ability to push through his agenda and shape the political landscape heading into the midterm election cycle.\n\nRasmussen's daily poll tracker shows that Trump's approval rating has increased by 1 point since yesterday, from 50 percent to 51 percent. Meanwhile, his disapproval rating has decreased by 1 point, from 48 to 47 percent. That gives him a net approval rating of +4 points.\n\nThat is in line with Newsweek's tracker, which today shows that Trump's approval rating stands at 49 percent, while his disapproval also stands at 49 percent. That means that the president's approval rating has increased by 1 point since yesterday, but his disapproval rating has remained the same.\n\nHowever, despite the president's positive results, most polls conducted in recent days have shown his net approval rating in the negative.\n\nThe latest Fox News poll, conducted between March 14 and 17 among 994 registered voters, showed Trump's net approval rating at -2 points. Fifty-one percent approve of his job performance, and 49 percent disapprove. The poll had a margin of error of ±3 percentage points.\n\nMorning Consult's latest poll, conducted between March 14 and 16 among 2,210 registered voters, showed 50 percent disapproving and 48 percent approving. The poll had a margin of error of ±2 percentage points.\n\nMeanwhile, the latest YouGov/ Economist poll gave him a net rating of -3, while NBC's poll put the president at -4 and Atlas Intel's at -5. The YouGov/ Economist poll's results were within the margin of error.\n\nTrump's lowest net approval rating over recent days came in a poll conducted by Reuters and Ipsos between March 11 and 12 among 1,422 respondents, which showed his rating at -8. In that poll, 52 percent disapproved of his performance, while 44 percent approved. The poll had a margin of error of ±3 percentage points.\n\nOther polls conducted by Echelon Insights and Quantus Insights have given Trump a positive approval rating of between 1 and 3 points. His highest approval rating came in a poll conducted between March 6 and 13 among 3,000 registered voters by RMG research, which showed his net rating at +10 points, with 54 percent approving and 44 percent approving. The poll had a margin of error of ±2 percentage points.\n\nRecent polls have suggested that dissatisfaction with Trump's handling of the economy is a key factor in his declining popularity. The latest poll conducted by NBC News found that more than half (54 percent) said they disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy, compared to 44 percent who approve.\n\nAtlasIntel's latest poll shows similar levels of dissatisfaction with Trump's handling of the economy. According to the survey, 48 percent think Trump's handling of the economy has been \"terrible\" or \"poor,\" while 48 percent also said it has been \"good\" or \"excellent.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News's poll showed that 56 percent of respondents disapproved of Trump's handling of the economy, while 43 percent approved. And in another blow to Trump, an overwhelming 71 percent said they believe the United States economy will go into a recession this year, while just 26 percent disagreed.\n\nThis comes as Trump proceeded with plans to impose additional tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China this month, which some experts say could increase inflation.\n\nGoldman Sachs previously estimated that the tariffs could push inflation by 1 percent while squeezing U.S. company profits and provoking retaliatory measures from other countries. Canada, for example, has announced billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs.\n\nAt the same time, inflation is already affecting the economy, as a Labor Department report for January saw the largest consumer price increase in nearly 18 months.\n\nHowever, inflation fell more than expected to 2.8 percent in February, according to the annual consumer price index (CPI).\n\nTrump has sought to blame inflation on his predecessor, former President Joe Biden. During a White House event on Tuesday, Trump said the U.S. and its economy \"went to hell\" under Biden. Last week, in his national address to Congress , Trump said, \"We inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.\"\n\nHowever, a Morning Consult poll published on March 20 shows that the message no longer resonates with voters.\n\nAccording to the poll, more voters than not now say current economic conditions are mostly the result of Trump's policies instead of Biden's. This is compared to February, when 44 percent of respondents said economic conditions resulted from Biden's policies, while 39 percent said the same about Trump.\n\nNow, 46 percent say Trump is to blame for current economic conditions, while 41 percent say Biden is to blame.\n\nTrump's approval and disapproval ratings are both at 49 percent. His approval rating is up 1 point from yesterday, while his disapproval rating has remained the same. That is in line with his approval rating from previous days, according to Newsweek 's tracker, which showed his approval rating remained steady, around 48 percent, throughout last week, peaking at 49 percent on March 6.\n\nHis disapproval rate has also mostly remained at 48 percent, hitting a low of 47 percent on March 6. It now stands at 50 percent.\n\nTrump's 49 percent approval rating is lower than former President Joe Biden 's popularity at the same point in his presidency on March 21, 2021, when he had an approval rating of 54 percent and a disapproval rating of 41 percent, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nPolls released in the days after Trump's inauguration showed his popularity at an all-time high. However, he was still the least popular president in recent times.\n\nAccording to Gallup's first poll of Trump's second term, conducted between January 21 and 27, his initial approval rating was 47 percent. The pollster said this figure made him less popular than any president since 1953 at the start of a term and the only one to begin with a sub-50 percent approval rating. Gallup said Biden started his first term with a 57 percent approval rating.\n\nThe RealClearPolitics tracker shows that on March 21, 2017, Trump's approval rating was 44 percent, while his disapproval rating was 50 percent, giving him a net approval rating of -6 points.\n\nThat makes Trump marginally more popular now than at the same point in his first term, but about the same amount of people disapprove of his job performance.\n\nTrump's approval rating will likely fluctuate in the coming weeks depending on the outcome of key events, including critical negotiations on the Russia-Ukraine war, the growing tariff battle with countries such as Canada, and concerns about a recession.\n\nNewsweek will update Trump's average approval rating every week.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMartha McHardy is a U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on polling and California politics.

That's coming out of the Department of Education immediately.\"\n\nHe said he believes the student loans will be serviced \"much better\" by the Small Business Administration than in the past.\n\nMeanwhile, the Small Business Administration announced on Friday that it would cut its staff by about 2,700 jobs, or 43 percent, as part of a reorganization, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\"By eliminating non-mission-critical positions and consolidating functions, we will revert to the staffing levels of the last Trump Administration,\" Loeffler said in a statement.\n\nTrump's executive order signed on Thursday stated that the DOE is \"not a bank\" and must \"return bank functions to an entity equipped to serve America's students.\"\n\nTrump also announced that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

So I think that will work out very well. Those two elements will be taken out of the Department of Education,\" the president said.\n\nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration Kelly Loeffler, on X (formerly Twitter): \"Thank you, Mr. President. The SBA stands ready to take the lead on restoring accountability and integrity to America's student loan portfolio.\"\n\nRepresentative Gil Cisneros, a California Democrat, on X: \"President Trump's decision to make the SBA handle student federal loans makes no sense.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nNew polling from conservative television channel Fox News shows President Donald Trump underwater among voters when it comes to his handling of the economy.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House via email for comment on Thursday.\n\nWith inflation surging about 20 percent during former President Joe Biden 's four years in office, economic worries were top of mind for millions of voters when they cast their ballots in 2024. The economy was consistently ranked as the top issue for voters ahead of the presidential election, according to numerous public surveys.\n\nTrump promised to bring prices down and boost the economy. However, since taking office his tariff policies have spooked investors, and a number of economists are increasingly raising concerns about a possible economic downturn.\n\nThe president's tune on the economy has also changed, with him declining to rule out the possibility of a recession.\n\nIn the latest Fox News polling , which was carried out from March 14 to 17, a majority of registered voters said they disapprove of Trump's handling of the economy thus far: 56 percent of respondents disapproved while 43 percent approved-meaning the president's approval on the issue is underwater by a double-digit 13 point margin.\n\nNotably, that's a sharp reversal from the trend during Trump's first term in office, when his approval on handling the economy was consistently above water in Fox News polls. Even in December 2020 right before he left office, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump's approval on the economy stood at 52 percent, with 48 percent disapproving.\n\nWhen it comes specifically to inflation, the poll showed Trump even more underwater. The survey had 58 percent disapproving of the president's handling of inflation compared to 40 percent who approved-a negative 18-point margin.\n\nThe new poll also showed Trump slightly underwater overall. When asked generally whether they approve or disapprove of the job the president is doing, 49 percent approved while 51 percent disapproved.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted for Fox News by Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research, included 944 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n\nRecent NBC News polling from earlier in March showed similar results, with 54 percent disapproving of Trump's performance on the economy and 44 percent approving. When it came specifically to inflation and the cost of living, 55 percent disapproved compared to 42 percent who approved.\n\nThe NBC poll included 1,000 registered voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday, Trump's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC's Meet the Press that there are \"no guarantees\" the U.S. won't face a recession. His remarks echoed similar comments from Trump and Vice President JD Vance this month-which have led to growing concerns from investors and economists.\n\nAnalysts have warned that Trump's new tariffs will increase inflation, while his threats of further taxes on foreign imports are causing uncertainty for businesses. The president and his allies say that there will be a transition period with potential economic fallout in the short term, but the country will ultimately be better off due to the administration's policies.\n\nPresident Donald Trump to Fox News when asked about recession concerns earlier this month: \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. That's a big thing... it takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, to Fox News Sunday last weekend: \"These [economic] experts are funded by lobbyists who have an agenda. Look, it's very simple, I talk to car company CEOs from all over the world, every single solitary week, and the consistent message is, we're going to build more in America.\"\n\nRobert Reich, an economist and former Labor secretary, on X last Friday: \"The economy is showing severe warning signs after Trump's first month in office. This shouldn't be surprising. He doesn't understand the economy and tanked pretty much every business he ever touched.\"\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to Meet the Press earlier this month : \"There's going to be no recession in America. ... Global tariffs are going to come down because President Trump has said, 'You want to charge us 100%? We're going to charge you 100 percent.'\"\n\nThe president has doubled down on tariffs and his administration has suggested they are not overly concerned about stock market swings for now. The administration has increasingly signaled that the American people should expect some economic disruptions in the near term.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJason Lemon is a Senior Politics Editor at Newsweek based in Brooklyn, New York.

Citizens from these countries would also be required to undergo mandatory in-person interviews.\n\nCountries on this list include:\n\nThe draft yellow list includes 22 countries, which would have 60 days to address deficiency concerns or risk being moved to another category.\n\nSome of the issues these countries would have to address include failing to share information about incoming travelers with the U.S., inadequate security practices for issuing passports, and selling citizenship to people from banned countries.\n\nCountries on this list include:\n\nDonald Trump's executive order in January stated that travel bans would be reimplemented to protect Americans \"from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\"\n\nThe State Department previously said it was following Trump's order and was \"committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, shortly after becoming president in 2021, Joe Biden revoked the travel bans that Trump imposed in his first term. Biden called the bans a \"stain on our national conscience\" and \"inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.\"\n\nOfficials at embassies, State Department regional bureaus and security specialists are currently reviewing the draft memo, according to the New York Times . Amendments to the lists may be made before a final decision is taken by the Trump administration.\n\nIt is not yet clear if individuals from affected countries with existing visas would be exempted from the restrictions, or would have their visas canceled.\n\nBrendan Cole is a Newsweek Senior News Reporter based in London, UK.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's approval rating has taken a hit, slipping into negative territory for the first time as disapproval outweighs approval, according to an average calculated by Newsweek .\n\nTrump's approval rating is a key indicator of his political strength as he navigates his second term and prepares for future policy battles.\n\nA shift in his numbers could influence support from Republican lawmakers, affect his ability to push through his agenda, and shape the political landscape heading into the midterm election cycle.\n\nNewsweek's average of the 10 most recent polls found that Trump has an approval rating of 47 percent, while his disapproval rating stands at 49 percent.\n\nIt is the first time Newsweek's tracker has shown Trump in negative territory after his approval rating had held steady at 48 percent over the past week, briefly peaking at 49 percent on March 6. His disapproval rating had also remained mostly at 48 percent, dipping to 47 percent on March 6 but now rising to 49 percent.\n\nIt comes as Trump's approval rating has been on a steady decline in recent polls, with one survey last week marking the first time his net approval turned negative since his return to the White House on January 20. The latest YouGov/Economist poll, conducted between March 9 and 11 among 1,532 registered voters, shows his disapproval rating rising to 47 percent, up from 45 percent in a survey conducted between February 23 and 25. Meanwhile, his approval rating has dipped from 48 percent to 47 percent. Both polls carried a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nAn Emerson College poll conducted from March 8 to 10 found Trump's approval at 47 percent and disapproval at 45 percent, a decline from 48 percent approval and 43 percent disapproval recorded in early March. A Trafalgar Group/InsiderAdvantage poll from March 5 also showed a drop in support, with approval falling to 50 percent from 54 percent in February. Both surveys had a margin of error of about 3 percentage points.\n\nAnd in Quinnipiac University's latest poll, conducted between March 6 and 10 among 1,198 registered voters, Trump disapproval was up by 4 points, at 53 percent, while his approval rating decreased to 42 percent from 45 percent in the previous poll, conducted on February 19. The poll had a margin of error of +/- 2.8 percentage points.\n\nSome polls have shown an increase in Trump's disapproval rating, while his approval rating has remained the same or increased.\n\nFor example, in the latest poll conducted by Reuters and Ipsos between March 11 and 12 among 1,422 respondents, his disapproval stood at 52 percent, up from 51 percent in the previous poll, conducted between March 3 and 4 among 1,174 adults. However, his approval rating stayed the same at 44 percent. Both polls carried a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n\nRecent polling suggests that dissatisfaction with Trump's handling of the economy is a key factor in his declining popularity. Quinnipiac's latest poll showed 41 percent approve of his handling of the economy, while 54 percent disapprove. And according to the latest YouGov/Economist poll, Trump's approval rating on jobs and the economy stands at 43 percent, while 47 percent disapprove. This marks a shift from February, when 44 percent approved and 45 percent disapproved.\n\nRegarding inflation and prices, Trump's approval rating has fallen by 2 points in the YouGov/Economist poll, now at 38 percent, with disapproval rising from 49 percent to 52 percent. However, his handling of taxes and government spending has seen the most significant drop. Currently, 47 percent of respondents disapprove of his performance on the issue, up from 43 percent in February, while 44 percent approve, down from 48 percent.\n\nThese trends are echoed in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which revealed that 57 percent of Americans think Trump's moves to shake up the U.S. economy have been too erratic. This includes his aggressive strategy on tariffs, which many say has spooked the stock market.\n\nTrump proceeded with plans to impose additional tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China this week, a move that some experts say could increase inflation. Goldman Sachs previously estimated that the tariffs could push inflation up by 1 percent while squeezing U.S. company profits and provoking retaliatory measures from other countries. Canada, for example, has announced billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs.\n\nAt the same time, inflation is already affecting the economy, as a Labor Department report for January saw the largest consumer price increase in nearly 18 months. However, other indicators show inflation has been falling more recently.\n\nIn the Reuters/Ipsos poll, 70 percent of respondents-nine in 10 Democrats and six in 10 Republicans-said they expect higher tariffs to make groceries and everyday purchases more expensive. Additionally, 61 percent of respondents indicated that Trump's top priority should be addressing rising prices.\n\nCNN's latest poll, conducted from March 6 to 9 among 1,206 respondents, found the highest levels of dissatisfaction with Trump's handling of tariffs. A majority, 61 percent, disapproved of how Trump is handling tariffs, while only 39 percent approved. The same poll revealed that 56 percent of respondents disapprove of his handling of the economy, with 44 percent approving. Similarly, in the Emerson College poll, Trump's disapproval rating was highest on the U.S. economy, with 48 percent disapproving and 37 percent approving.\n\nTrump's net approval rating went negative for the first time in his second term on Friday, with more people disapproving of his job performance than approving. It comes after his approval rating had remained steady, at 48 percent, over the past week, peaking at 49 percent on March 6, according to Newsweek's average.\n\nHis disapproval rate has also mostly remained at 48 percent, hitting a low of 47 percent on March 6. It now stands at 49 percent.\n\nTrump's 47 percent approval rating is lower than Joe Biden 's popularity at the same point in his presidency on March 14, 2021, when he had an approval rating of 53 percent and a disapproval rating of 42 percent, according to RealClearPolitics.\n\nPolls released in the days following Trump's inauguration showed his popularity at an all-time high. However, he was still the least popular president in recent times.\n\nAccording to Gallup's first poll of Trump's second term, conducted between January 21 and 27, he had an initial approval rating of 47 percent. The pollster said this figure made him less popular than any president since 1953 at the start of a term, and the only one to begin with a sub-50 percent approval rating. According to Gallup, Biden began his first term with a 57 percent approval rating.\n\nTrump is also less popular now than he was at the same point in his first term.\n\nThe RealClearPolitics tracker shows that on March 14, 2017, his approval rating stood at 50 percent, while his disapproval rating stood at 44 percent.\n\nTrump's approval rating is likely to fluctuate in the coming weeks depending on the outcome of key events, including critical negotiations on the Russia-Ukraine war, the growing tariff battle with countries such as Canada, and concerns about a U.S. recession.\n\nNewsweek will update Trump's average approval rating every week.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nMartha McHardy is a U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on polling and California politics.

Tammy Duckworth are demanding answers about Elon Musk's trip to the Pentagon on Friday, in a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.\n\n\"Did the Pentagon today provide Mr. Musk with a top-secret briefing today on U.S. war plans for China?\" the Democratic senators asked in the letter, obtained by NBC News.\n\n\"Mr. Musk arrived at the Pentagon earlier today. But it remains unclear exactly what information he received, and whether you or other Pentagon officials modified plans for him to receive top-secret information 'on the U.S. military's plan for any war that might break out with China,'\" they continued.\n\nThe New York Times reported yesterday that Musk had been invited for a briefing on the U.S.'s plans for a potential war with China.\n\nPresident Trump denied those claims during an Oval Office press conference today, claiming he wouldn't have allowed the briefing because Musk has businesses in China and said he could be \"susceptible\" to that.\n\nBoth Trump and Hegseth claim Musk came to the Pentagon to discuss DOGE.\n\nActing head of Social Security, Leland Dudek, is threatening to close down the vital agency after a ruling blocking Elon Musk's cost-cutting team DOGE from accessing to sensitive taxpayer data.\n\nJudge Ellen Lipton Hollander issued a two-week temporary restraining order Thursday banning Social Security officials from sharing personally identifiable information, calling DOGE's efforts \"essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"\n\nDudek, who is consulting with agency lawyers and the Justice Department, complained on Friday that all the data at the agency was personally identifiable information and claimed that Hollander's ruling was \"overly broad.\"\n\n\"Unless I get clarification, I'll just start to shut it down.

Critics say, however, that his business interests as the CEO of Tesla could pose a conflict of interest for the American public.\n\nMusk's views on China drew attention this week after The New York Times reported that he would receive a briefing about highly sensitive American military plans for any potential war with China. Musk, however, has denied that report.\n\n\"The New York Times is pure propaganda,\" he wrote on X (formerly Twitter ). \"Also, I look forward to the prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously false information to NYT. They will be found.\"\n\nMusk, who continues to serve as the CEO of Tesla, does have business in China, which is the second-largest market for the company. Tesla sales in China rose 8.8 percent in 2024. The company also opened a factory in Shanghai in 2019, which The Wall Street Journal reported to be the company's largest factory in the world.\n\nRead in full from Andrew Stanton on Newsweek.\n\nLee Gelernt, an ACLU lawyer, told Judge Boasberg that several of the people deported last weekend have been returned from El Salvador.\n\nThe El Salvadoran government refused to accept several of the people on the flights because they either weren't Venezuelan or were women, according to Politico.\n\nThe United States has imposed a travel ban on former Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, her planning minister Julio Miguel De Vido, and their families, citing their involvement in significant corruption during their time in office. The U.S. State Department accused Kirchner and De Vido of abusing their positions to orchestrate and financially benefit from multiple bribery schemes related to public works contracts, resulting in millions of dollars being stolen from the Argentine government.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio stated that both individuals had been convicted in multiple courts on corruption charges. He emphasized that the U.S. will continue to hold individuals accountable for abusing public power for personal gain. This move reaffirms the U.S.'s commitment to fighting global corruption, even at the highest levels of government.\n\nThe Trump administration took drastic action on Friday by firing nearly the entire civil rights division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), effectively dismantling an office that oversaw the president's immigration policies, The New York Times reported. More than 100 staff members were told they would be placed on leave and officially fired in May, according to current and former officials.\n\nIn addition, the administration closed the ombudsman for Citizenship and Immigration Services, another office responsible for scrutinizing legal immigration policies. These moves align with Trump's broader efforts to eliminate oversight mechanisms and civil rights protections across government agencies.\n\nThe closure of DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties is particularly significant, as the office has played a key role in monitoring immigration policies, such as investigating the controversial \"Remain in Mexico\" program. Critics argue that these actions represent an attack on civil liberties, with Deborah Fleischaker, a former DHS official, calling it a \"clear message\" that civil rights are not a priority for the administration.\n\nDHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin defended the decision, stating that the move was meant to streamline oversight and remove perceived roadblocks to immigration enforcement. She argued the offices had hindered operations by adding bureaucratic obstacles.\n\nFederal judge James Boasberg has criticized attorneys from the Department of Justice for using \"the kind of intemperate and disrespectful language I'm not used to hearing from the United States\" in their filings.\n\nBoasberg is presiding over the case involving the deportation flights which left for El Salvador last weekend, despite his court order.\n\nThe judge is trying to determine whether the Trump administration violated his order to stop the deportations and turn the planes back around.\n\nHe has repeatedly set deadlines for the DOJ to answer his questions regarding the flights, but the attorneys have been reluctant to do so. They have told the court that the government is deciding whether to use the state secrets act to prevent them having to answer the judge's questions.\n\nThe Department of Justice have filed a motion to remove Judge Beryl Howell, who serves on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, from the court challenge to Trump's executive order on Perkins Coie.\n\nLast week, Howell temporarily blocked an order to remove security credentials from law firm Perkins Coie, which worked with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nIn a motion filed today, the DOJ claimed that Howell was not impartial because she had been critical of the Trump administration previously, and not attempted to block the investigation into Trump by former special counsel Jack Smith.\n\n\"Fair proceedings free from any suggestion of impartiality are essential to the integrity of our country's judiciary and the need to curtail ongoing improper encroachments of President Trump's Executive Power playing out across the country,\" the DOJ said in its motion.\n\n\"In this case, reasonable observers maywell view this Court as insufficiently impartial to adjudicate the meritless challenges to President Trump's efforts to implement the agenda that the American people elected him to carry out. In fact, this Court has repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the President.\"\n\nThe Trump administration is exploring the possibility of offering economic aid to farmers who may face hardship due to the president's upcoming global tariffs, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins told reporters on Friday.\n\nIf implemented, the aid could resemble the multibillion-dollar bailout introduced during Trump's first term in response to the trade war with China, which impacted U.S. agricultural exports.\n\nThe tariffs, set to take effect on April 2, target countries accused of imposing unfair trade barriers against U.S. goods, raising concerns about economic slowdown and rising prices. While the White House has kept details vague, Rollins emphasized that the administration is working on programs to support farmers through potential economic challenges. Direct payments to producers could be a part of these efforts.\n\nNEW: Trump administration weighs economic aid for farmers affected by tariffs, recalling his first term, when the president offed a generous, multibillion dollar bailout to offset his trade war. Link below.\n\nCommon Cause is taking aim at Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer over his support for a Republican funding plan, accusing him of prioritizing avoiding a government shutdown over standing firm on Democratic principles.\n\nThe democracy and voting advocacy group placed a billboard in New York City that reads, \"Chuck just sold us out.\" Last week, its members made more than 18,000 calls to congressional offices urging opposition to the bill.\n\nSchumer, who described the funding bill as \"terrible,\" has faced criticism from the left for allowing it to pass, though he argued that a shutdown would grant President Trump even more power.\n\nThe Department of Justice is attempting to remove President Donald Trump as the defendant in a civil lawsuit related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nThe Supreme Court decided last year that former and sitting presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution related to official acts they made while in office. Following the decision, the Justice Department dropped charges against Trump, including ones related to the riot at the Capitol building.\n\nDespite the criminal prosecution coming to an end, Trump still faces civil lawsuits related to the events of January 6. The Justice Department is arguing that the president also has immunity from civil lawsuits, and the U.S. government should be the defendant in these cases instead.\n\nAttorneys representing the U.S. government filed a notice of substitution in a January 6 lawsuit on Thursday. The lawsuit, brought by U.S. Capitol Police officers James Blassingame and Sidney Hemby in 2021, alleges that Trump's actions caused them to suffer physical and emotional injuries.\n\nRead in full from Jenna Sundel on Newsweek.\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw told constituents at a town hall Friday that he would fight to restore jobs for veterans laid off amid federal job cuts, but acknowledged that not all positions should be preserved.\n\n\"Just because you're a veteran doesn't mean you're good at it,\" said Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL. \"But if you're doing a job that we need you to do, and you're doing it well, we've got to fight for you.\"\n\nThe comments come as the Department of Veterans Affairs plans to cut over 80,000 jobs, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nE lon Musk is the most followed person on X, formerly known as Twitter , as well as being the site's owner, and he is also one of the site's most prolific users, often posting dozens of times a day, or sharing other people's posts. Here's what he has said in the last 24 hours:\n\nIn the last day, Musk has posted or reposted 59 times, with the majority of his posts being about news clips from Fox News and the President Donald Trump's executive order to shut down the Department of Education, which was signed on Thursday.\n\nMusk's posts have been a combination of news about the Trump administration, updates on protests against Tesla and the vehicles it manufactures, and podcast clips about himself and Trump .\n\nMusk also shared several graphics promoting Grok , the AI feature run through X, calling on followers to \"just Grok it.\"\n\nRead the full story by Theo Burman on Newsweek.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is considering lifting sanctions and resuming the sale of fighter jets to Turkey following a recent conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump expressed interest in finalizing the sale of F-16 jets and indicated he may be open to including the advanced F-35 jets if Turkey renders its Russian S-400 missile system inoperable, according to sources.\n\nPotential solutions include disassembling the S-400 machinery or moving it to a U.S.-controlled base in Turkey. Congress had approved a $23 billion deal last year to sell 40 F-16s and modernization kits for Turkey's existing fleet, though negotiations with Lockheed Martin are ongoing.\n\nTurkey was removed from the F-35 program in 2019 after acquiring Russia's S-400 system, which raised concerns about exposing sensitive U.S. military technology to Russian intelligence. Trump's team is reviewing legal and technical options to avoid violations of U.S. sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).\n\nWhile resuming F-35 sales would be controversial and raise concerns among U.S. allies like Israel and Greece, experts warn that isolating Turkey could push the country toward Russia and China for weapons supplies.\n\nTrump suggested Friday that the reciprocal tariffs set for April 2 may not be finalized, indicating that some exceptions could be possible.\n\n\"The word flexibility is an important word,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office. \"There'll be flexibility,\" he added, without specifying what that might entail.\n\nTrump referenced previous requests from major U.S. automakers for an exemption from the 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods that were set to take effect earlier this month. In response, he exempted cars and car parts that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\n\n\"I gave the American car companies a break because it would have been unfair if I didn't,\" Trump said. He added that all products from Mexico and Canada meeting USMCA standards would receive the same treatment through April 2.\n\nTrump defended his recent executive orders targeting top law firms that have clashed with him and his administration. Speaking from the Oval Office on Friday, Trump dismissed concerns that his actions amounted to coercion, insisting that the firms \"did bad things\" and emphasizing that they are \"very sophisticated people.\"\n\n\"The law firms all want to make deals,\" Trump said. \"Are those the law firms you're talking about? They're not babies. They're very sophisticated people.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced that he had rescinded an executive order suspending security clearances for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison after the firm agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services to support his administration's initiatives.\n\nThe agreement with Paul Weiss comes as Trump continues cracking down on large corporate firms. Earlier, he signed executive orders targeting Covington & Burling and Perkins Coie.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force has shared a glimpse of the new F-47 fighter jet after Trump announced Boeing had won the contract to create the sixth generation.\n\n\"Dominate the Skies,\" the said in a post on X.\" Get your first look at what will be the most advanced, lethal, & adaptable fighter ever developed... the U.S. Air Force's F-47.\"\n\nThe video rolls through generations one to five of the fighter jets, offering just a tiny glimpse of the F-47 at the end of the clip.\n\nDominate the Skies Get your first look at what will be the most advanced, lethal, & adaptable fighter ever developed... the U.S. Air Force's F-47. pic.twitter.com/ca1CeBABb5\n\nDonald Trump has suggested there will be some flexibility when it comes to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs he is imposing on global trading partners on April 2.\n\n\"People are coming to me and talking about tariffs, and a lot of people are asking me if they could have exceptions. And once you do that for one, you have to do that for all,\" Trump said at the White House Friday.\n\n\"The word flexibility is an important word. Sometimes there's flexibility, so there'll be flexibility.\"\n\nIt was not clear if that flexibility also related to the 25% tariffs which will resume on Canada and Mexico.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has received a boost in his approval ratings, with recent polls showing positive shifts in public perception.\n\nTrump's approval rating is a key indicator of his political strength as he navigates his second presidential term and prepares for future policy battles.\n\nA shift in his numbers could influence support from Republican lawmakers, affect his ability to push through his agenda and shape the political landscape heading into the midterm election cycle.\n\nRasmussen's daily poll tracker shows that Trump's approval rating has increased by 1 point since yesterday, from 50 percent to 51 percent. Meanwhile, his disapproval rating has decreased by 1 point, from 48 to 47 percent. That gives him a net approval rating of +4 points.\n\nThat is in line with Newsweek's tracker, which today shows that Trump's approval rating stands at 49 percent, while his disapproval also stands at 49 percent. That means that the president's approval rating has increased by 1 point since yesterday, but his disapproval rating has remained the same.\n\nRead in full from Martha McHardy on Newsweek.\n\nNASA astronauts Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams arrived home on Tuesday after nine months in space. Their trip to the ISS was only supposed to last around a week but was extended due to technical issues.\n\nDespite being stuck in space for 278 days longer than originally expected, Wilmore and Williams did not receive overtime pay, a NASA spokesperson told Newsweek.\n\nStandard procedure is that astronauts receive regular, 40-hour workweek salaries when they're aboard the ISS. This does not include any overtime or holiday pay. But astronauts do receive incidental pay of $5 for each day they spend in space. Since Wilmore and Williams spent 286 days in space, this amounts to $1,430 in incidental pay for each astronaut.\n\nThe news sparked outcry among the public on behalf of the astronauts.\n\nWhen asked about the lack of overtime pay for them, Trump said he hadn't heard about the issue but promised to get them paid.\n\n\"If I have to, I'll pay that out of my own pocket,\" he said. \"That's not a lot for what they had to go through.\"\n\nTrump admitted on Friday that there as \"nothing earthshattering\" in the John F. Kennedy assassination files he ordered to be released and unclassified this week.\n\n\"I don't think there is anything earth shattering... but you'll have to make that determination,\" he said told reporters at the Oval Office on Friday.\n\nDonald Trump has suggested that the vandalism of Tesla showrooms, in protest of Elon Musk, was worse than than the damage caused by the January 6 riots.\n\n\"When I looked at those showrooms burning,.. these are terrorists,\" Trump said of the protesters attacking Tesla dealerships.\n\n\"You didn't have that on January 6 I'll tell you that.\"\n\nTrump conceded that \"a very beautiful young woman\" died on January 6. Multiple Capitol police officers were also seriously injured, with one dying from a stroke the following day, while several went on to end their own lives. Several rioters also died due to health conditions.\n\nNo one involved n the Tesla protests have been injured or killed.\n\nTrump repeated his claim that the protests are being \"funded\" and warned the people financing them are in \"just as much trouble\" as the demonstrators.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch broke from the Supreme Court majority on Friday on a decision about whether the failure to act can still be considered a violent crime.\n\nThe Court found that knowingly and intentionally causing injury or death, \"whether by act or omission, involves the use of physical force against another person.\"\n\nGorsuch voiced his disapproval of the majority's decision in a dissent joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson .\n\n\"By looking to the common law today, the Court produces a serious misfit,\" Gorsuch wrote.\n\nThe disagreement between the majority and the dissenting justices centers around Congress ' definition of a \"crime of violence.\" The majority said the statute \"has long been understood to incorporate liability for both act and omission.\"\n\nGorsuch, however, accused the Court of resorting to \"conjecture about implicit congressional purposes.\"\n\nRead the full story by Jenna Sundel on Newsweek.\n\nTrump defended his executive orders that revoked security clearances from several prominent law firms, a move that could severely impact their operations. Trump claimed the firms \"did bad things\" and accused them of attacking him \"ruthlessly, violently, illegally.\"\n\nTrump also revealed that one of the firms, Paul, Weiss, had already reached a deal with him and suggested that others may follow. \"They're not babies,\" Trump said. \"They're very sophisticated people,\" implying that the firms are now seeking to negotiate.\n\nPresident Trump has branded Minnesota Governor Tim Walz a \"loser\" after Kamala Harris' former running mate said he could \"kick most [Trump supporters'] asses.\"\n\n\"He's a loser, he lost an election,\" he added.\n\nOn CNN News Central , guest anchor Jessica Dean spoke with Tesla investor Ross Gerber about his calls for Elon Musk to step down as CEO, citing damage to the company's reputation. Gerber criticized Musk's leadership, saying, \"It sucks to be a Tesla shareholder and it sucks to be a Tesla owner,\" and urged the company to bring in crisis management experts.\n\nMeanwhile, former Education Secretary Margaret Spellings told anchor John Berman that Trump's executive order dismantling the Education Department could reduce accountability in education. She warned that eliminating data systems could hinder efforts to track student achievement.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) also joined Dean to discuss Democratic prospects in the 2026 midterms. She claimed Republican lawmakers were \"afraid\" and avoiding town halls because they lack voter support, predicting losses for the GOP in November.\n\nPresident Trump denied reports that Elon Musk was set to be briefed today on the United States plans for a potential war with China, citing the billionaire's own interests in the country.\n\nWhen asked why he wouldn't brief close ally Musk, Trump said he didn't want \"anybody\" seeing America's potential war plans.\n\n\"You wouldn't show it to a businessman who is helping us so much,\" he said, referring to Musk.\n\n\"I certainly wouldn't want, you know Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible perhaps to that.\"\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that he had ordered the full release of documents related to President John F. Kennedy's assassination, defending the decision to include unredacted Social Security numbers.\n\n\"I was given the task of releasing that, because many presidents have gone through it and they haven't released, and I said, 'Release,'- we even released Social Security numbers,\" Trump said in the Oval Office. He argued that withholding any information would raise suspicions, adding, \"They're long gone, so I can't imagine ... if you do delete it, we have people going to say, 'Why did you delete it?'\"\n\nThe National Archives posted the documents online Tuesday evening, with over 2,000 files identified by record numbers but lacking detailed descriptions. While researchers will need time to analyze the documents, Trump downplayed the likelihood of any shocking revelations.\n\n\"I don't think there's anything that's earth-shattering, but you'll have to make that determination,\" Trump said.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth, standing alongside Trump in the Oval Office, praised Trump's leadership while announcing the F-47 aircraft. Hegseth described the decision as a \"gift\" for future generations, contrasting it with what he called the failures of the previous administration.\n\n\"Under the previous administration, we looked like fools,\" Hegseth said, blaming the Biden administration for delaying action on the aircraft. He claimed Biden officials had chosen to leave the decision to the next generation.\n\nTrump mentioned that a prototype of the F-47, which is accompanied by drones, had been tested for five years but did not provide further details about the project.\n\nPresident Trump announced a new new fighter jet program with Boeing.\n\nThe new F47 jet is expected to be the expensive in history and has the aim of being able to compete with China's air force if war ever broke out between the two nations.\n\nBut today, as he announced it alongside defense secretary Pete Hegseth, Trump declined to share the cost, saying \"We can't give you the price because it would give away secrets.\"\n\nHe added that the whole project had been a \"big secret\" and even the photos of the new plane, unveiled today, only showed a small part of the actual aircraft.\n\nHegseth called the announcement a \"big day\" for America and said the program was \"the next generation of air dominance.\"\n\nTurkey's main opposition leader, Özgür Özel, renewed calls for peaceful demonstrations following the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, a leading rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. İmamoğlu, detained in a dawn raid on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terrorist links, faces accusations of being politically targeted ahead of the 2028 presidential race. Government officials deny these claims, asserting Turkey's courts act independently.\n\nDespite authorities widening bans on protests in Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir, Özel urged supporters to take to the streets to express their opposition to the arrest, calling it a reaction to the government's alleged injustices. Violent clashes erupted between demonstrators and police, with tear gas and water cannons used to disperse crowds. The Interior Ministry reported over 50 detentions and multiple injuries during protests.\n\nImamoglu's arrest, just days before his expected presidential candidacy announcement, has led to calls for a symbolic election to show support for the mayor. Analysts warn that he could be replaced by a \"trustee mayor\" if formally charged with links to the PKK, an outlawed organization. The situation has sparked both political and economic unrest, with the Borsa Istanbul index dropping by 7%.\n\nDonald Trump is continuing to divide up the responsibilities of the Education Department after his executive order aimed at dismantling the government department.\n\nThe president said Robert F. Kennedy will be taking over the responsibility for special needs care and school nutrition programs.\n\n\"That's rather complex. I think that will work out very well,\" Trump said in a Friday press conference from the Oval Office.\n\nTrump added that he guaranteed that within a few years, \"we're going to have tremendous results\" comparable to Norward and Sweden.\n\nThe United States has refused a request by Mexico for water after supplies under a treaty reached the cutoff point for special deliveries.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Mexican President's office for comment via email.\n\nIt comes as Trump has taken a tough approach to Mexico. His administration reinstated the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, which requires asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico while their U.S. immigration cases are processed. Additionally, the administration ended \"catch-and-release\" practices, which previously allowed detained migrants to be released into the U.S. while awaiting immigration proceedings.\n\nTrump has also intensified efforts to expand the border wall, adding new barriers along the southern border. Meanwhile, he has hit Mexico with new tariffs which he says are designed to reduce the flow of drugs over the border. The tariffs could push Mexico into a technical recession this year, according to analysts.\n\nThe new move by Trump opens up the possibility for a new battle between Mexico and the Trump administration over border issues.\n\nRead the full story by Martha McHardy on Newsweek.\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced from the Oval Office today that the Small Business Administration (SBA) is taking over responsibility for student loans, as he continues to wind down the Education Department.\n\n\"That's coming out of the Department of Education now,\" he said, adding that the management of student loans has \"been a mess.\"\n\nKelly Loeffler, United States Administrator of the Small Business Administration, will be taking over responsibility for the loans.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering invoking the \"state secrets privilege\" to withhold information about deportation flights transporting Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche disclosed this ongoing debate in a Friday court filing, responding to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's demand for the details.\n\nBlanche mentioned that Cabinet-level discussions are underway to decide whether disclosing the information could pose a national security risk. The administration has criticized the judge's request as an \"unnecessary judicial fishing\" expedition, while Boasberg dismissed its earlier response as \"woefully insufficient.\" The judge had previously blocked deportations under an 18th-century wartime law and will hear additional arguments later on Friday afternoon.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has reportedly granted a contract for new fighter jet program, worth billions of dollars, to Boeing.\n\nThe new jet, which is set to be the most expensive in history, would be in the air by the 2030s with the aim of being able to compete with China's air force if war ever broke out between the two nations. The piloted planes would be able to fight alongside semiautonomous drones, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe new jets are expected to cost as much as several hundred million dollars each, a huge increase compared to the Air Force's current Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters, which cost around $80 million.\n\nTrump and defense secretary Pete Hegseth are expected to announce more details in a joint address from the Oval Office today.\n\nMahmoud Khalil, a legal U.S. resident with no prior criminal record, participated in a brief court session on Thursday, where only scheduling matters were addressed. A more substantial hearing has been set for April 8, as Khalil's legal team works through several legal channels to secure his release.\n\nKhalil, who was born in Syria to a Palestinian family and is married to a U.S. citizen, had previously been active as a spokesperson for Columbia University students protesting Israel's military actions in Gaza. His detention follows an ongoing crackdown on protests against U.S. policy, which former President Trump denounced as \"antisemitic\" and \"anti-American.\"\n\nKhalil, in a statement issued earlier this week, decried his detention as an example of \"anti-Palestinian racism\" and emphasized the broader implications for similar activists in the U.S.\n\nBillionaire Trump ally Elon Musk had been expected to attend a briefing with military leaders in the Pentagon's Tank today, during his visit to the Department of Defense headquarters, the New York Times reports.\n\nHowever, it was reportedly called off after the Times reported on the briefing which would have reportedly seen Musk briefed on the U.S. military's plan for war with China.\n\nThe Tank is a secure conference room in the Pentagon which is typically used by the Joint Chiefs for high-level meetings with visiting combatant commanders.\n\nHours after the Times article was published yesterday, Pentagon officials and Trump denied the briefing would involve China.\n\n\"China will not even be mentioned or discussed,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\nA top Pentagon spokesperson, John Ullyot, has been reassigned following backlash over his response to reports that the Department of Defense removed an article about Jackie Robinson, the Black sports icon who served in World War II.\n\nUllyot faced criticism after issuing multiple, conflicting statements on Wednesday without senior leadership approval. He attempted to downplay the incident by framing it as a sign that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs were \"dead\" at the Pentagon. His reassignment highlights the Pentagon's struggle to manage messaging and implement Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's directive from February to remove all DEI-related content from its websites and social media.\n\nThe Pentagon issued a clarification on Thursday, acknowledging that important content had been mistakenly taken down for review.\n\nCalls by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to buy Tesla stock raises many legal and ethical problems, several legal experts have told Newsweek .\n\nThe Hatch Act prohibits officials appointed to the executive branch, such as cabinet members, from using their position to make partisan political statements or promote private businesses for political reasons. Lutnick may be in violation of the Hatch Act, several legal experts believe.\n\nTesla has been hit by a consumer boycott because its chief executive, Elon Musk , is also head of Donald Trump 's federal budget slashing Department Of Government Efficiency. On March 19, as Tesla stock continued to plunge, Lutnick urged the public to buy Tesla stock while it is still cheap.\n\n\"If you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,\" Lutnick told host Jesse Watters on Fox News . \"It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is so cheap. It'll never be this cheap again,\" Lutnick said.\n\nRead in full from Sean O'Driscoll on Newsweek.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche informed a federal judge on Friday that the Trump administration is holding Cabinet-level discussions on whether to invoke the state secrets privilege in response to demands for more information about last weekend's deportation flights.\n\nThe Department of Justice faced strong criticism from US District Judge James Boasberg, who accused the agency of failing to comply with his order to release the requested details by noon ET Thursday. Instead, the DOJ submitted a sealed filing after the deadline, including a sworn statement from an ICE official offering general information on the flights.\n\nBoasberg called the DOJ's response \"woefully insufficient,\" noting that the filing referenced Cabinet-level discussions, but the declaration was based on the official's \"unsubstantiated understanding.\" The judge criticized the lack of concrete information, stating that the government could not rely on such vague statements.\n\nTaiwanese President Lai Ching-te has taken the rare step of speaking out against China, warning it is a \"foreign hostile force.\"\n\nLai is also calling to bring back martial law-era military courts to punish Chinese spies leaking national security secrets, and has pledged to increase Taiwan's defense spending.\n\nTypically, Taiwanese leaders are careful not to provoke Beijing, while still defending their own sovereignty.\n\nBut China has been ramping up its threats to take Taiwan by force, and as Taiwan's biggest backer, the United States, seems to be wavering in its support, he also wants to \"highlight for the U.S. the dangers it continues to face from China, and the proactive steps it is taking to defend itself,\" said Amanda Hsiao, China director for the Eurasia Group, told the Washington Post.\n\nElon Musk recently wrapped up an 80-minute meeting with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon, The New York Times reports.\n\nWhen asked about the discussion, Musk responded, \"Always a great meeting. I've been here before, you know.\"\n\nDetails of the meeting were not disclosed.\n\nPresident Trump's executive order on dismantling the Department of Education (DOE) will spare some programs deemed critical by the administration.\n\nSince its founding in 1979, the DOE has overseen federal education policy , administering funding to states and school districts, enforcing civil rights protections, and conducting research on educational institutions across the country.\n\nDespite Trump's commitment to preserving \"useful\" programs, the move has already been met with criticism from lawmakers, as well as unions representing parents and teachers, who have argued that the department plays a crucial role in maintaining quality within the school system and promoting equal access to education.\n\nAccording to Trump's speech on Thursday, a number of \"useful functions\" which fall under the DOE's remit will be \"preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them.\"\n\nThe exact agencies to which these functions will be transferred has not yet been made clear by the administration. Trump previously suggested that the Small Business Administration could take control of federal student loan programs, the New York Times reported, adding that the Treasury was another option.\n\nCNN, based on plans outlined in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 policy blueprint, said that programs relating to support for disabled students could be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nRead the full story by Hugh Cameron on Newsweek.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has announced it will eliminate weather balloon launches in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, due to staffing shortages. In addition, the service will reduce balloon launches from twice daily to once daily in several cities, including Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska; and Riverton, Wyoming.\n\nEarlier this month, the NWS also reported similar cuts in Albany, New York, and Gray, Maine.\n\nThese changes follow job cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the Trump administration, which led to the loss of hundreds of positions. Before these reductions, weather balloons were launched twice a day from 100 locations across the U.S., Caribbean, and Pacific Basin. These balloons carry instruments that measure vital atmospheric data, including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and direction.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested that Americans vandalizing Tesla dealerships in protest of Elon Musk, could be sent to a notorious El Salvador prison.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump said, \"I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla.\n\n\"Perhaps they could serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions!\"\n\nThe Trump administration set up a deal with the government of El Salvador to ship deported migrants to the country, where they are mostly held in its C E COT anti-terrorism prison Human Rights Watch has accused the prison of allowing widespread abuses including a lack of access to food and health care.\n\nTrump previously pledged to treat anyone damaging property to Tesla as domestic terrorism.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk's PAC is paying $100 for signatures on a petition to oppose \"activist judges\" in a Wisconsin election.\n\nMusk's America PAC is running the giveaway through April 1, which is when voters in the swing state decide whether its highest court stays liberal or flips conservative.\n\nThe \"special offer for Wisconsin voters\" also gives anyone who refers someone to sign the petition a $100 bonus, on top of the $100 for their own signature.\n\n\"Judges should interpret laws as written, not rewrite them to fit their personal or political agendas,\" the petition reads . \"By signing below, I'm rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role - interpreting, not legislating.\"\n\nOnce they are in the voting booth, voting privacy laws mean that people who were paid to sign the petition don't have to disclose who they actually voted for; Republican Brad Schimel or Democratic candidate Susan Crawford.\n\nIn an effort to regain political momentum, Democratic lawmakers have increasingly turned to online influencers and content creators, hoping to leverage their massive followings to reach voters. In the weeks leading up to President Trump's joint address to Congress, Senate Democrats met with a dozen progressive online personalities, while House Democrats were introduced to 40 content creators to help boost their online presence.\n\nEarlier in February, prominent figures like YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen led a tutorial session for Democrats. This has resulted in a surge of Democratic content across social media, including livestreams, direct-to-camera explainers, and podcasts. While some videos have gone viral, others have sparked mockery from both liberal allies and Republicans.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that if the U.S. or any other nation acts against Iran, they will \"receive a severe blow.\" His remarks, delivered in a televised speech and amplified on official social media, come as tensions escalate between Washington and Tehran.\n\nThe warning follows U.S. President Donald Trump 's statement on Monday that Iran would be held responsible for Houthi attacks. The group, which controls a large part of Yemen, has ramped up its military actions, prompting U.S. airstrikes. The Houthis have expanded their military operations, striking both Israel and international shipping routes, drawing U.S. retaliation. Iran's role in supporting militant groups has fueled concerns of a wider conflict, with Washington directly linking Tehran to escalating instability.\n\nIran also faces a possible attack on its nuclear program by Israel, potentially with the support of the United States, which has said Tehran cannot be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons - something it has has denied trying to do.\n\nAs part of the \"Axis of Resistance,\" an Iran-backed coalition that includes Hamas , Hezbollah, and Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, the Houthis have long positioned themselves against U.S. and Israeli interests .\n\nOn Friday, Khamenei dismissed U.S. claims that regional resistance groups are Iranian proxies, saying, \"The Yemeni nation and resistance groups have their own motivations. Iran doesn't need proxies.\"\n\nRead in full from Amir Daftari on Newsweek.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to meet with billionaire Elon Musk at the Pentagon on Friday to discuss \"innovation, efficiencies & smarter production.\" Musk, a key adviser to Trump, has been involved in efforts to reduce the size of the government through his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMusk's approach to slashing government programs and laying off workers has sparked significant controversy, with some lawmakers and voters criticizing his methods. However, Trump supporters have praised his efforts.\n\nA senior defense official revealed that the Pentagon plans to cut between 50,000 to 60,000 civilian jobs as part of these initiatives. Hegseth is also expected to deliver remarks alongside President Trump at the White House on Friday.\n\nRep. Pat Harrigan (R-NC) appeared on CNN This Morning , addressing concerns over backlash at town hall events and the upcoming visit of Elon Musk to the Pentagon.\n\nWhen discussing federal job cuts, Harrigan downplayed the impact, stating that only a small fraction-half of one percent-of the federal workforce had been affected. He compared the current situation to the federal layoffs during the Clinton administration, stressing that such measures have historical precedent.\n\nRegarding recent protests at his office dedication, Harrigan claimed that many of the demonstrators were paid outsiders, not constituents from his district. He said half of the protesters came from outside the area and disrupted the event.\n\nOn Musk's planned involvement in Pentagon spending cuts, Harrigan expressed support, calling it the president's prerogative to enlist Musk's expertise in reviewing military budgets. Harrigan highlighted Musk's success as a businessman and his ability to identify inefficiencies in government spending.\n\nTrump has reiterated his stance that the U.S. Department of Education is wasteful and influenced by liberal ideology. His latest executive order calls for the dismantling of the department, with a focus on returning education authority to states and local communities. However, completing this task may be impossible without legislation from Congress, which established the department in 1979.\n\nRepublicans have expressed plans to introduce such legislation, while Democrats are quickly mobilizing to oppose the idea. Trump's order directs the education secretary to take steps to close the department, though it offers little detail on how the process will unfold. The White House has indicated that certain critical functions, such as Title I funding for low-income schools, Pell grants, and special education funding, will be preserved.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jeb Boasberg criticized the Trump administration for failing to comply with his order temporarily blocking deportations of Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be gang members. Despite the judge's directive, flights carrying the immigrants landed in El Salvador, prompting Boasberg to demand answers by noon Thursday.\n\nThe administration resisted, calling the request an \"unnecessary judicial fishing expedition.\" In a written order, Boasberg called the administration's response \"woefully insufficient,\" accusing officials of repeating general information and evading their obligations.\n\nBoasberg has now ordered the administration to explain why it did not comply, raising the possibility that officials could be held in contempt of court.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at reducing waste, fraud, and abuse by improving data transparency across federal agencies. The order mandates that agency heads provide full access to unclassified records and systems to enhance oversight and eliminate inefficiencies.\n\nThe order also grants the Secretary of Labor access to unemployment data to strengthen fraud detection. According to the White House, restricted data access under the Biden administration led to billions in improper payments, with an estimated $236 billion lost in 2023 alone.\n\nSince returning to office, Trump has pushed for a leaner government by freezing federal hiring, eliminating unnecessary agencies, and launching deregulation efforts. The new order is part of his broader plan to streamline operations and protect public funds.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney made a subtle jab at U.S. President Donald Trump in a statement about his need to find \"reliable partners\" in trade.\n\nThe newly elected leader of the incumbent Liberal Party said Canada needed \"new trade routes\" in the wake of Trump's aggressive tariff policy, which drastically increased taxes on Canadian goods entering the U.S.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the White House for comment via email.\n\nCarney recently replaced Justin Trudeau as Canada's prime minister, amid heightening tensions around tariffs with the U.S., its largest trade partner. He has previously called Trump's trade policy \"unjust\" and has rejected calls by Trump to make Canada the 51st state.\n\nTrump's tariffs have resulted in a trade war between the two countries, and deepening political and ideological divisions have raised concerns about the future relationship between the longtime allies.\n\nRead the full story by Theo Burman on Newsweek.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders drew a crowd of 15,000 supporters in Tempe, Arizona, for his \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, filling the arena and packing the overflow area.\n\nThank you the 15,000 people who came out in Tempe, Arizona tonight for our Fighting Oligarchy tour. In fact, not only was the arena filled, but the overflow crowd was also at capacity. Americans will not hand their democracy over to authoritarianism. pic.twitter.com/X16NpvcM2r\n\nThe Trump administration's plan to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education is based on misleading claims that student achievement has not improved since the department was founded in 1979. According to The New York Times , while student performance in reading and math has recently declined, data shows that American student achievement had steadily improved for decades prior to the pandemic.\n\nMath scores for 13-year-olds nearly doubled between 1978 and 2012, and reading scores also saw gains. Experts attribute this progress to factors like school integration and accountability reforms during the No Child Left Behind era.\n\nThe administration also pointed to rising school spending as a reason to eliminate the department, but research shows that increased funding-especially for low-income students and teacher quality-leads to higher test scores and college attendance.\n\nTrump's plan would shift education control to states, potentially increasing disparities in funding and outcomes between states.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has issued a warning to student loan borrowers following the sudden shutdown of the Department of Education.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Department of Education for comment via email outside office hours.\n\nIn an executive order on Thursday, President Donald Trump directed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to begin the process of eliminating the Department of Education. He called it a \"very historic action\" before signing the order. The directive instructs McMahon to \"preserve in full\" key programs such as Title I, Pell Grants, and resources for students with disabilities, while cutting others.\n\nThe shutdown of the Department of Education puts millions of student loan borrowers at risk of delayed payments, processing errors, and limited access to financial aid support, according to opponents. The shutdown also raises concerns about loan scams and reduced oversight, leaving borrowers more vulnerable to predatory practices.\n\nRead the full story by Martha McHardy on Newsweek.\n\nMigrants deported from the U.S. to Panama, including individuals from Afghanistan, Russia, Iran, and China, are struggling to secure asylum in other countries. Left in limbo, they have been visiting embassies and consulates in Panama City in search of help, but have been met with rejection or no response.\n\nThe U.S. deported nearly 300 people to Panama in February, using the country as a stopover for difficult deportations. Some voluntarily returned to their home countries, but others, fearing persecution, refused and were sent to a remote jungle camp before being released earlier this month.\n\nMany of the deportees, including Afghan national Hayatullah Omagh, say they fear returning home and have pleaded for refuge. However, embassies have told them they cannot assist, and international aid organizations have offered little hope of asylum in Panama.\n\nU.N. refugee officials acknowledged the challenges but warned that U.S. aid cuts have strained refugee services. As options dwindle, the deportees fear being forgotten.\n\nRussian drones struck the Ukrainian port city of Odesa late Thursday, injuring three people and causing large fires, local officials said Friday. Odesa region head Oleh Kiper reported \"local emergency power outages\" in three districts, suggesting possible damage to the city's energy infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for increased sanctions and defense support from Western allies, saying such pressure is necessary to halt Russian aggression.\n\nThe attack coincided with Czech President Peter Pavel's visit to Odesa, underscoring the ongoing threat despite a temporary ceasefire deal that was meant to protect energy infrastructure.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, accused Ukraine of blowing up a gas facility in the Kursk region, a claim Kyiv denies. The facility had previously pumped natural gas to Europe before supplies were halted last year.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement, brokered by President Trump, remains unclear, with differing views between Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. about which targets are protected.\n\nSen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana and strong Trump supporter, arrived in Beijing on Thursday as the U.S. and China exchange tariff threats and accusations over the fentanyl trade. Daines, the first U.S. lawmaker to visit China since Trump's return to office, said he plans to discuss curbing fentanyl production and ensuring fair market access for Montana's farmers and ranchers.\n\nDaines' office said he is working closely with the White House and promoting Trump's \"America First\" agenda during the trip. Chinese officials welcomed Daines, emphasizing the importance of stable U.S.-China relations but offered no details on his meetings.\n\nThe visit comes as the U.S. imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting China to retaliate with 15% duties on American farm products. The U.S. accuses China of failing to stop the export of fentanyl precursors, while China insists it is committed to cooperation but opposes U.S. sanctions.\n\nRussia accused Ukraine of striking a gas pipeline in Sudzha, thus violating an agreement not to strike each other's energy infrastructure brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump .\n\nUkraine accused Russia of hitting the gas station and falsely accusing Kyiv of responsibility.\n\nThe technical details of the energy infrastructure ceasefire are due to be worked out in the coming days, but both Presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky had already agreed in calls with Trump to temporarily stop such strikes.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday morning that Putin's order not to strike energy infrastructure remains in place despite Ukraine's actions, Russian state media reported.\n\nThe Russian military called the Sudzha blast a \"deliberate provocation of the Kyiv regime\" to \"discredit the peace initiatives of the President of the United States,\" state-owned TASS reported.\n\nA day before, Russia had accused Ukraine of violating a ceasefire agreement by striking its oil depots.\n\nBut the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a Facebook post that Russia was \"increasing the discreditation campaign against Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Yes, the enemy blamed our Defense Forces in the bombardment of the Sudzha gas station,\" said post. \"These allegations are baseless. Yes, the mentioned station was repeatedly shelled by the Russians themselves.\"\n\nRead the full story by Shane Croucher on Newsweek.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAmanda M.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tax plan could give some Americans an extra $24,000 per year.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump is looking to eliminate income tax for Americans earning less than $150,000, and at the higher end of that bracket, some would save up to the $24,000.\n\nExperts, however, are concerned with this massive endeavor and its potential long-term ramifications on the U.S. economy.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump suggested that he could eliminate the federal income tax by implementing an all-tariff policy.\n\nThis has garnered criticism from some who say adding tariffs instead of an income tax would hurt low- and middle-income Americans while rewarding only the top earners.\n\nLutnick shared Trump's plans in an interview this week. \"How about no tax on tips? How about no tax on overtime? How about no Social Security? How about all those things-these are the kind of thoughts that will change America. I know what his (Donald Trump) goal is ... no tax, for anybody who makes less than $150,000 a year. That's his goal. That's what I'm working for,\" Lutnick told CBS .\n\nSingle Americans making $150,000 fall under the 22 percent federal tax bracket, which equates to around $24,000 deducted from their paychecks for U.S. income taxes.\n\nAlex Beene, financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek : \"Eliminating income tax on those making less than $150,000 would obviously be a huge economic stimulus to a group of taxpayers who have been on the smaller end of recent tax cut efforts.\n\nThis effort that would support lower and middle class homes additionally in a big way will undoubtedly find support, but the question is how much would it add to a ballooning deficit. The new administration is betting new tariffs and other international taxes could fill in the gap of this lost tax revenue, but history shows that assumption isn't always a sound one. Basically, this is a wait-and-see story on all fronts.\"\n\nKevin Thompson, finance expert and founder of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek : \"Another one of Trump's proposals aims to put more money into Americans' pockets-but without much economic justification or logistical backing. The idea is to eliminate taxation for those making less than $150,000.\n\nSurprisingly, corporations would benefit the most. Eliminating income taxes for those under $150,000 removes the pressure for companies to provide livable wages. Instead of corporations stepping up with higher wages, the burden shifts back onto taxpayers.\"\n\nThompson said Americans might feel financial relief in the short term from having more take-home pay under Trump's tax cut, but there could be larger issues in the long run.\n\n\"Long-term, this could lead to growing federal deficits as tax revenue declines, but government spending continues,\" Thompson said. \"Future generations would inherit increased debt burdens. Advocates might argue that growth and consumption could offset some losses, but we're talking about trillions in lost revenue-a massive gap to fill. So yes, you might keep more of your paycheck now, but you'll pay for it later through higher national debt and greater economic uncertainty.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA petition urging that Congress begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump be impeached has attracted more than 250,000 signatures, according to the nonprofit that initiated it.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the White House and Free Speech for People , the campaign group that set up the petition, for comment via email.\n\nThe petition's support highlights the growing political division in the country during Trump's second term in office.\n\nFree Speech for People said on March 7 that its petition gained more than 250,000 online signatures. The specific figure has not been released by the group.\n\nFree Speech for People launched the \"Impeach Trump Again\" campaign on January 20, the same day as Trump's inauguration, citing reasons such as his pardoning of those involved in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and attempting to remove birthright citizenship.\n\nThe group cites multiple other reasons for Congress to potentially impeach the Republican for his actions during his second term. These include Trump's ongoing efforts to drastically reduce federal spending and allegedly abusing his power while seeking retribution against political enemies.\n\nThe group is also calling for Trump's impeachment after he suggested the U.S. could \"take over\" the Gaza Strip following a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas .\n\nSpeaking after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on February 4, Trump suggested Palestinians could be resettled as the U.S. rebuilt the war-torn region into the \"Riviera of the Middle East.\"\n\nTexas Representative Al Green vowed to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump in February, saying the president's plans amounted to \"ethnic cleansing\" in Gaza.\n\nGreen, who sought to impeach Trump multiple times during his first term, has yet to file the latest impeachment resolution against the president. Green said he was \"working on [his] articles of impeachment\" after he was removed from the House chamber for heckling Trump while the president was delivering his March 4 address to Congress.\n\nThe House later voted to censure Green for distributing Trump's speech. The vote was 224-198, with 10 Democrats joining all Republican representatives in approving the censure resolution.\n\nTrump was impeached twice by the House during his first term but acquitted both times by the Senate .\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nJohn Bonifaz, president of Free Speech for People, said in a statement: \"The Constitution has a remedy for a corrupt, lawless president: impeachment. Donald Trump has already committed multiple abuses of power since assuming the Oval Office again, and he must be held accountable. More than 250,000 people across the country have now joined this call for impeachment proceedings against Trump. We urge all Americans who still believe in the Constitution and our democracy to join us at this critical moment in our nation's history. And we urge members of Congress to follow the mandate of their oath of office, stand with Congressman Al Green, and invoke the power of the impeachment clause to address the direct and serious threat Donald Trump poses to our Republic.\"\n\nCourtney Hostetler, Free Speech for People's legal director, added: \"We applaud Congressman Al Green for demanding that the U.S. Congress hold Donald Trump accountable through the impeachment process for his dangerous abuses of power. As Trump repeatedly undermines our democracy and ignores the Constitution, we will continue to call on Congress to fulfill its duty by investigating and, if necessary, removing this corrupt executive from office.\"\n\nRepresentative Al Green said on the House floor on February 5: \"Ethnic cleansing in Gaza is not a joke, especially when it emanates from the president of the United States. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere, and injustice in Gaza is a threat to justice in the United States of America. I rise to announce that the movement to impeach the president has begun. I rise to announce that I will bring articles of impeachment against the president for dastardly deeds proposed and dastardly deeds done.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump in a February 9 fundraising message to his supporters: \"I won in a LANDSLIDE VICTORY, and now, Democrat lunatics have threatened to IMPEACH ME AGAIN after my Historic Trump Executive Orders! I will never let them STOP MAGA. If you support me on my mission to SAVE AMERICA, I'm humbly asking for you to make a huge statement right now that Democrats want to start another SHAM IMPEACHMENT.\"\n\nCostas Panagopoulos, political science professor at Northeastern University, previously told Newsweek : \"Right now, it's unlikely Trump would be impeached in the House and even less likely he'd be convicted by the Senate. Impeachment attempts could backfire on Democrats if they're advanced for less serious transgressions, but we cannot rule out the possibility of more flagrant incidents that qualify as high crimes or misdemeanors that would justify impeachment.\"\n\nAny impeachment resolution requires a simple majority in the House to trigger a trial and a two-thirds majority in the Senate for conviction.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump suggested that the United States could join the British Commonwealth on Friday in a post to Truth Social, his social media platform.\n\nThe president shared an article from British tabloid The Sun reporting that King Charles III was making a \"secret offer\" to the White House, and that plans are in process for the U.S. to become an associate member of the international organization.\n\n\"I Love King Charles. Sounds good to me!\" Trump wrote in response to the report.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the Commonwealth for comment via email Friday afternoon.\n\nThe Commonwealth is primarily comprised of former British colonies or dependencies, born out of the breakup of the British Empire in the mid-20th century. Joining such a group could be seen as a different tact to Trump's other messages on groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) and the United Nations (U.N.), which he has been skeptical of.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, the king is expected to make the offer to make the U.S. the 57th member of the Commonwealth at a time when America's relationship with the European Union ( EU ) has been strained over Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia.\n\nThe offer is being seen as a way to bolster the U.S. and United Kingdom's so-called \"special relationship\", despite America having famously split from British rule in the 1700s. The two countries have frequently worked together on foreign policy in the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nWhile joining the Commonwealth would largely be symbolic, as the group does not affect governance of its member nations, the move could be used to help avoid the heightened tariffs on steel and aluminum Trump has promised, according to The Daily Mail .\n\nTrump has shown his support for the British royal family for many years and visited Buckingham Palace as part of a state visit during his first term in the White House. The idea to join the Commonwealth was first floated during that 2017-2021 term.\n\nThe king invited Trump back to the U.K. for another visit in a letter hand-delivered by British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on his trip to the White House . At the meeting, Trump described King Charles III as \"a beautiful man.\"\n\nKing Charles III in a statement on Commonwealth Day on March 10: \"In these uncertain times, where it is all too easy to believe that our differences are problems instead of a source of strength and an opportunity for learning, the Commonwealth's remarkable collection of nations and peoples come together in the spirit of support and, crucially, friendship...The Commonwealth's ability to bring together people from all over the world has stood the test of time and remains as ever-important today.\"\n\nWhile it's not clear if the U.S. would definitely join the Commonwealth, neighbors Canada are part of the group of nations, and at a time of heightened cross-border tensions, being part of the same collective could help ease matters.\n\nUpdate 3/21/25, 12:56 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nJason Lemon is a Senior Politics Editor at Newsweek based in Brooklyn, New York.

      "text": "Why it matters that Trump is deleting government data\n\nData disruptions could cause big issues in both the public and private sectors.\n\nWhat happens when one of the world's largest repositories of free information becomes unreliable?\n\nThat dire situation came to pass in late January, when many federal websites took down entire datasets to avoid possibly violating a series of executive orders from President Donald Trump. At the same time, the Department of Government Efficiency, the Elon Musk-directed task force that is slashing government operations, has canceled contracts for the collection of data and cut workers who analyze and evaluate information about various facets of American life, such as education , housing and consumer protection . These developments led to widespread concern that some data that researchers have long relied on the government to collect would no longer be readily available, potentially hindering various initiatives meant to help Americans - both inside and outside of government.\n\nAlthough some information has come back online, the availability and transparency of government-collected data is suddenly no longer a given. This isn't a worry just for data journalists like us, either. Experts I spoke with laid out how the public and private sector, companies large and small, and even the average person use government data to make decisions about program effectiveness, business prospects and life choices. With this in mind, I delved into this recent interruption in data access, why this data has significant value and what challenges may lie ahead if government data becomes less accessible and reliable moving forward.\n\nSince taking office on Jan. 20, Trump has signed a record number of executive orders , which tell executive branch agencies how to interpret existing laws when implementing policies. Among other things, these orders directed the federal government to recognize only two genders , pause foreign aid efforts and end diversity, equity and inclusion programs . To ensure they weren't violating those orders, many departments and offices took down datasets, fact sheets and other resources dealing with issues of gender and race. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took down data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System , which includes questions asking whether teens identify as transgender.\n\nAcross the government, agencies removed thousands of websites and datasets , from guidelines for vaccinations and avoiding sexually transmitted infections to data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey . Some have since come back online ; others have not . Concerned about the potential loss of critical information, many organizations and individuals around the country worked to preserve what might otherwise be lost by archiving the remaining datasets and recovering missing info from older versions of websites using tools like the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine .\n\nOne way to assess the scope of the losses is to look at the total number of datasets that are available on Data.gov , an official government website that catalogs thousands of datasets, predominantly from federal agencies but also other sources, such as local governments . On Jan. 19, the day before Trump took office, there were nearly 308,000 datasets on Data.gov, but that figure had fallen to around 305,500 by Jan. 22. In early February, that number increased again, although it has not returned to the pre-Trump total.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these topline numbers from Data.gov represent only a back-of-the-envelope measure of data loss. Some datasets linked on the site aren't necessarily available when you click on them, such as many hosted by the United States Agency for International Development, which the Trump administration has all but shuttered . Plus, the site's count has changed for many reasons over the years, such as the removal of older datasets, shifts in technology or changes to which non-federal organizations are linked on the website. For instance, during the early days of former President Joe Biden's tenure in January 2021, the number of datasets available on Data.gov remained largely static . But then the retooling of the site using an updated cataloging service led to a drop of around 25,000 in the raw count of downloadable files in early February of that year.\n\nIt's not just academics, journalists and government officials who were impacted by this loss. In our information-driven age, large portions of the U.S. economy use government data to make business decisions. \"In their development of plans, businesses have to benchmark how they compare to the rest of the industry or in markets that they're targeting,\" said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, a senior visiting fellow at Third Way. \"You can't do that without government data.\"\n\nFormerly the chief global economist at Ford Motor Co., Hughes-Cromwick knows firsthand the importance of government data to operating an automobile manufacturer. A paper she coauthored in 2019 presented a table of short-run and long-run indicators that a car company would rely on when making production decisions, which can involve data from at least nine different bureaus, departments or other entities within the federal government.\n\nThis data can help a carmaker determine its hiring, investment and production goals. For instance, when setting monthly production targets, a firm will review data on auto sales from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, data from the Federal Reserve on the production levels of all types of vehicles across the automotive industry and consumer prices from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The company uses this data to set production levels at each plant, even the speed of the assembly line.\n\nMore broadly, Hughes-Cromwick stressed that leading indicators in the data can affect long-term business plans. Companies across sectors considering whether to expand a product line may look at unemployment insurance claims from the Department of Labor to see if the overall market is weakening (claims rise) or improving (claims fall). They will look at whether retail spending is up (good) or down (bad) using sales data from the Census Bureau . Businesses also look to datasets that come from nongovernmental sources but that are partly informed by government data, such as the Purchasing Managers Index , a measure compiled by the Institute for Supply Management that firms, suppliers and investors use to get a sense of current and future market conditions.\n\nSectors that are especially reliant on this data also affect huge parts of the economy and produce sizable output. Last year, the Department of Commerce estimated that industries that heavily rely on government data reached revenues of almost $800 billion in 2022, nearly twice as much as in 2012. In that time, government-data-intensive sectors grew faster than the economy as a whole, with a particular boost from internet-based publishing, broadcasting and search portals as well as management consulting services.\n\nGovernment data is particularly useful to the financial services industry. Naturally, firms such as commercial banks, asset management companies and equity brokerages use this information to decide where to direct their investments in the economy. But they also use this information to stress test whether their current portfolios could withstand a major economic or financial shock to the system. Regulations requiring this sort of testing came about in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to make sure systematically important financial institutions maintained sounder footing in the face of future adverse conditions.\n\nAgencies in the federal government do more with data than collect and collate it. They use that information to identify public policy problems, develop programs to address those problems and then evaluate whether or not the programs are working using an evidence-based approach built on rigorous assessment of the data. \"It's this whole cycle that's really important, and that is, I think, in jeopardy right now,\" said Molly Irwin, former chief evaluation officer at the U.S. Department of Labor and a board member at the Data Foundation .\n\nIrwin pointed to the labor market as an example of how this cycle works. The government collects jobs data, and the Department of Labor uses that information to identify gaps in the labor market where employer needs aren't being met. The department then funds grant programs to train workers to fill those holes. Once those programs are in place, the department evaluates their effectiveness using administrative data gathered by the programs. They also conduct studies, which can involve surveys and interviews with employers - in essence, collecting even more data that gauges whether a program is working. That evidence is used to determine how well a program is working and how it could be improved. A successful program could become an approach that others also use to fill future labor market needs.\n\nHowever, Irwin told me the means for federal evaluators to examine program effectiveness are now up in the air due to funding and staff cuts made by the Trump administration . For instance, DOGE canceled around $900 million in contracts at the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics, spending aimed at collecting information on the U.S. education system - data that will now be unavailable for researchers hoping to improve educational outcomes. Staff cuts at the Department of Housing and Urban Development have eliminated positions that compile data on the housing market and study solutions to homelessness and affordable housing. The Department of Labor, meanwhile, has taken down databases that contain information regarding effective training and employment programs, including the Clearinghouse for Labor Evaluation and Research.\n\nThis seemingly runs against the goals of legislation that Trump signed into law in 2019, during his first term: the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act . The legislation essentially laid out a system for collecting and accessing data that federal agencies can use to develop evidence-based policies. It compels agencies to submit annual plans for determining and addressing policy challenges to the Office of Management and Budget as well as Congress. In 2024, a survey of federal evaluation officials conducted by the Data Foundation and American Evaluation Association found that 83 percent reported that the Evidence Act had helped them achieve their missions.\n\n\"[The law] was really about building the capacity in the federal government to do research studies, to build and produce evidence and, importantly, to use that evidence to make evidence-based decisions,\" Irwin said. \"Those are the tools that we are losing as the evidence capacity and the datasets and, in many cases, the reports of findings and all of that goes away.\"\n\nThe prospect of government data becoming less accessible or lower-quality could have long-term consequences - both tangible, in terms of dollars and cents, and intangible, in terms of confidence in the data that helps run our world.\n\nGovernment data is, practically speaking, free for businesses to use. Open data is readily accessible and paid for by taxpayer dollars. A company like Zillow, for instance, leveraged governmental datasets and market analysis to become a leading provider of real estate information for consumers - all while having a market capitalization of almost $19 billion . Acquiring alternative forms of economic and demographic data, if it's even available, could become a cost for companies that currently doesn't affect their bottom line.\n\nMoreover, knowledge and confidence in economic data help drive investment choices. As Lizzie O'Leary at Slate recently observed , swings in the stock market and bond market affecting beaucoup dollars - not to mention the policies of the Federal Reserve - come in reaction to the monthly jobs reports from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But with the interruption in access to some government data, the people who use that data - firms, brokers, analysts, economists - could become less certain about its availability and reliability, which in turn could affect their investment choices, which in turn could affect the wider market.\n\n\"For any economist, we need a time series to do statistical and regression analysis for a lot of microeconomic data and industries that we might be examining,\" said Hughes-Cromwick, speaking about the possibility of data from government agencies becoming less accessible. \"They're running the risk of causing some discontinuous time series where we won't have measurements - let's say for March 2025 industrial production, or April 2025 employment statistics. That would be a significant breach in the quality and accuracy of our data.\"\n\nAnd while cutting evaluation teams from government departments could save money at first, it could prove expensive in the long run. If government programs remain in place - and despite the Trump administration's intention to cut parts of the federal budget, many will survive - they won't necessarily be evaluated as rigorously moving forward. That might make it more challenging to improve the functioning of a program, or allow a costly but ineffective program to remain in place. Additionally, Irwin noted that the Trump administration's cuts have halted ongoing studies that in some cases were nearly complete. As a result, those findings may never see the light of day, losing any gain from that investment.\n\nNow, this is not to say that improvements couldn't be made. \"Certainly there are some more modern approaches to developing statistics that would help improve the quality and timeliness of the data,\" Hughes-Cromwick said. But she pointed out entities like the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis have worked to expand access to real-time data from the private sector as well as administrative data.\n\nThe broader danger to the reliability and availability of government data could make it even easier to distrust information in a societal environment in which conspiracy theories can catch like wildfire on social media and the internet. Faith in government data may already be flagging given that public trust in government is quite low: In 2024, only about 1 in 5 Americans told pollsters that they trust the government to do what is right always or most of the time, according to data collected by the Pew Research Center .\n\nLastly, the removal of government information could be felt by all Americans. For instance, states, localities and parents use information from the National Center for Education Statistics to understand the strengths and weaknesses of school systems. \" The Nation's Report Card is something that parents use when they're thinking about, 'Where do I move?'\" said Irwin. \"'What are the statistics in different school districts so that I can move to a place to put my child into a school that is doing well?'\"\n\n\"All of us use data and information to make all kinds of decisions every day,\" Irwin told me. \"It's the same kind of information that we need at every level. How am I going to invest my personal budget?\"\n\nIt's the same with the government, she added; it should have those choices to invest its much bigger budget that comes from taxpayer dollars. \"We want the government to have that information so that they can invest dollars in the right things.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Americans voted for Trump, but don't support his agenda\n\nOur look at nearly 300 poll questions finds Trump is more popular than Trumpism.\n\nIn a press conference in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump last week, Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and the president's senior adviser, was asked whether the administration's sweeping cuts to government programs reflected the will of the voters. Musk insisted that the American people had \"voted for major reform\" and that the administration was simply delivering on that \"mandate.\"\n\nBut with the severity and scope of the administration's actions rapidly ramping up - including looming mass federal firings and a tariff war that threatens price hikes for key goods such as groceries, cars and electronics - it's worth asking how much the public actually supports what the White House is doing. Looking at all the polls that have been released since Trump took office, we find that while Americans express support for some of Trump's immigration policy and broad government reform in principle, they oppose most of what he has done in his first month as president.\n\nTo gauge support for Trump's policies and actions, I began by combing through every publicly available political poll that has been released since he took office on Jan. 20. Specifically, I was looking for any question that asked respondents if they supported* an action that Trump had taken or promised to take. As of Feb. 25 at 2 p.m. Eastern, this review yielded over 270 questions from 49 different polls. 538 has made the data for this analysis publicly available here , and we will be revisiting this list throughout Trump's term.\n\nBy far the most polled-on issue area was immigration. I found 63 questions asking about Trump's immigration policies, ranging from such topics as the deportation of undocumented immigrants who have been accused of committing violent crimes (supported by 89 percent of voters, according to an Ipsos/Washington Post poll conducted Feb. 13-18) to the removal of undocumented immigrants who arrived to the U.S. as children (44 percentage points underwater, 70-26 percent, according to the same poll) to whether immigrants removed from the country should be held in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, while they await transfer to their home countries (average support of just 37 percent across three polls).\n\nThe finding from these polls, and others, is similar to one unearthed by the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Opinion Research last month (though from a poll conducted before Trump took office , so it's not counted in our spreadsheet). Generally the broadest policies possible, such as \"deporting all immigrants\" and \"sending the military to the border to help with immigration,\" score rather well with the public (52 percent approve and 36 percent disapprove of using military force at the U.S.-Mexico border in the average poll).\n\nBut as pollsters get more specific, net approval of those policies tends to fall and go underwater. The AP found, for example, that deporting all undocumented immigrants \"even if they will be separated from their children who are citizens\" has just 28 percent of Americans in support and 55 percent in opposition. And arresting immigrants while they are at church or school is opposed by more than half of Americans. Excluding questions that ask about the military or Trump's declared state of emergency on the southern border, the public opposed Trump's immigration policies by about 1 point on average.\n\nTrump's executive order to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants (a power he does not have ) is underwater by 12 points on average, with 39 percent of adults approving and 50 percent disapproving of the order.\n\nThe administration has also moved swiftly to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in both the federal government and private companies . Musk has been particularly vocal about these issues, calling DEI initiatives wasteful and racist . On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order suspending DEI-related hiring policies in the federal workforce and rolling back funding for federal projects and schools that use DEI language - the latter of which has run into civil rights challenges in the judiciary.\n\nOverall, Trump's DEI-related policies are net negative with the public, with 45 percent approving and 47 percent opposing them. Here too we see the same dynamic of marginal support for broad action and opposition to more narrow proposals and their consequences. For example, according to a TIPP Insights poll , \"eliminat[ing] DEI programs in the federal government\" is popular (45 percent to 42 percent), but according to a late January Ipsos poll , \"closing all federal government DEI offices and firing all federal employees working in DEI initiatives\" is not (44 percent to 51 percent). A Data for Progress poll conducted Jan. 24-26 asked about terminating all DEI programs \"and placing their employees on administrative leave,\" and found 43 percent of the public in favor and 45 percent opposed.\n\nNo pollster has yet asked about the Department of Justice ordering investigations of private companies that use DEI, plausibly the more controversial use of federal power.\n\nTrump has also issued several executive orders about sex and gender. The most popular is a Feb. 5 order titled \" Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports ,\" which ends federal funding for any educational institution that allows transgender women to participate in female sports programs or enter female locker rooms in schools. This policy is popular with 65 percent of adults, per an Echelon Insights poll from Feb. 10-13, and with 64 percent per a Feb. 9-11 YouGov poll . On average, it is net positive by 32 points. Similarly, the public approves of a Trump order to officially recognize only two sexes and remove references to \"gender\" (replacing them with \"sex\") from all official federal business.\n\nHowever, the public opposes the president's efforts to remove transgender people from military service, with 41 percent approving in the average poll and 49 percent disapproving.\n\nThe president's proposed tariffs on imports from other countries have also been plentifully polled. To date, Trump has proposed four different tariffs: 10 percent on all imports from China, 25 percent on all imports from Mexico and Canada** and an additional 25 percent tariff on imports of steel and aluminum from every country. For now, Trump has paused the blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico but let the China and metals tariffs go into effect.\n\nAccording to the polls we have collected, of the four proposals, only the tariffs on Chinese goods are popular with the American people: 50 percent support them and 41 percent oppose them, on average. By contrast, just 36 percent of people support the tax on Canadian imports, with 54 percent opposed, in the nine questions that asked about this policy. The tariff on Mexico had a net approval rating of -12 points (39 percent in favor, 51 percent opposed). The extra duty on steel and aluminium imports is 9 points underwater.\n\nWhen they are asked about the economic consequences of tariffs - including rising prices domestically - voters have tended to favor them less. In an Ipsos/Reuters poll conducted last December, 29 percent of respondents agreed with the statement, \"It's a good idea for the U.S. to charge higher tariffs on imported goods even if prices increase,\" whereas 42 percent disagreed. Polls show most Americans believe tariffs will increase inflation for everyday goods. Plausibly, they mostly oppose them as a result.\n\nPerhaps the most sweeping changes have come under the umbrella of government reform, whereby Musk and Trump have sought to eliminate a range of government functions and fire employees en masse . Musk, in his capacity as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, has pushed for sweeping budget cuts and the outright elimination of several government agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nBut while Americans support efficiency and progress in vague terms, they don't like the specifics. When Data for Progress asked a sample of adults whether they approved of establishing DOGE, 46 percent said they were in favor and 36 percent opposed it. Quantus Insights got similar results asking about Musk's \"efforts in collaboration with President Trump's DOGE.\" But when Ipsos asked whether people support \"a task force for cutting federal spending led by Elon Musk,\" 53 percent said they disapproved, and only 42 percent said they approved.\n\nMusk and Trump have also not approached the spending cuts in ways Americans want. Sixty-two percent told Ipsos they did not support Musk and the White House \"temporarily freezing federal funding for government grants and services,\" which Musk's DOGE has done (potentially in violation of federal law and the Constitution ). And only 30 percent of the public wants Musk and Trump to be able to block \"spending that Congress has approved for all government grants,\" with 61 percent opposed. On average, when people are asked about DOGE or funding cuts, they respond net negatively by 9 points, with 39 percent in favor of Musk's work and 48 percent opposed.\n\nThe surveys on Musk and DOGE reveal stubborn support for government spending that conservatives have long had trouble grappling with. Other polls illustrate a future challenge for the White House and Congress: How can they reduce taxes, one of the more popular parts of Trump's agenda, while avoiding reducing popular spending?\n\nAccording to an AP-NORC poll conducted shortly before Trump took office, 67 percent of adults think the U.S. government spends too little on Social Security; 61 percent say too little on Medicare; 65 percent too little on education; 62 percent too little on assistance to the poor; and 55 percent too little on Medicaid. Yet these are the programs Republicans are targeting for cutting in order to offset reduced revenues from lower taxes on corporations and richer Americans.\n\nTrump's allies and conservative commentators have run into a classic finding in political science: Voters are \"symbolically conservative\" but \"operationally liberal.\" That is, they support liberal social programs and government spending at higher rates than they identify as liberals; to put it in inverse terms, people are more likely to call themselves conservative than they are to support the average conservative policy. It is also generally easier to sell people on vague language and abstract goals (\"Reduce the size of government! Make programs more efficient!\") than it is to sell them on the steps it would take to accomplish them (\"Fire a ton of people! Make benefits harder to get!\").\n\nA related divide is how people feel toward Trump the man versus how they feel toward his agenda. According to 538's average of presidential job approval polls , 48.1 percent of adults currently approve of Trump and 47.4 percent disapprove. However, in our new dataset of Trump issue polls, average support for his agenda is 7 points underwater, with just 38 percent supporting his policies and executive orders and 46 percent opposing them.\n\nOur new data sheds light on the question of whether the American people voted for everything they're getting under Trump or whether they supported him for other reasons . Given his agenda is currently 11 points lower than the vote share he won in the 2024 presidential election (49.8 percent), the most likely answer is that this isn't what Americans had in mind when they voted for him.\n\n*I included alternative wordings, such as \"approve\" and \"favor.\"\n\n**Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at 10 percent.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Did Trump Just Abolish the Department of Education?\n\nTrump Administration\n\nEmma Camp | 3.21.2025 12:49 PM\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump signed a long-awaited executive order that attempts to begin the dismantling of the Department of Education. But since only Congress can officially abolish the department, it's unclear how much effect Trump's order will have on the status quo.\n\n\"The experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars-and the unaccountable bureaucracy those programs and dollars support-has plainly failed our children, our teachers, and our families,\" the executive order reads. \"While the Department of Education does not educate anyone, it maintains a public relations office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than $10 million per year.\"\n\nThe order directs Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to, with \"the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.\" While the directive is vague, actions McMahon has already taken-specifically, firing or buying out half the department's staff-suggest how she might attempt to grind the department's functions to a halt.\n\nMcMahon is also light on specifics. In a Thursday statement, she assured Americans that \"closing the Department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them-we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers, and others who rely on essential programs.\" But she also argued that \"taxpayers will no longer be burdened with tens of billions of dollars of waste on progressive social experiments and obsolete programs. K-12 and college students will be relieved of the drudgery caused by administrative burdens-and positioned to achieve success in a future career they love.\"\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether Trump's order will actually functionally abolish the Department of Education, should Congress summon the will to legally dissolve the department, there's little reason to worry about the state of K-12 schools. The vast majority of K-12 educational funding comes from state and local sources. Instead, the Department of Education is primarily concerned with running the federal student loan program. (Trump's order frames the department's $1.6 trillion loan portfolio as making the department \"roughly the size of one of the Nation's largest banks.\")\n\n\"The Department of Education has entrenched the education bureaucracy and sought to convince America that Federal control over education is beneficial,\" the order states. \"Closing the Department of Education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Trump's Reading of the Alien Enemies Act Defies the Usual Meaning of Its Terms\n\nImmigration\n\nJacob Sullum | 3.21.2025 6:00 PM\n\nJames Boasberg, the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, has caught a lot of flak for temporarily blocking the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). As President Donald Trump tells it , Boasberg is a \"Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator\" who is wrongly preventing him from \"doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do.\" According to Trump, Boasberg's intervention was so egregious that he \"should be IMPEACHED!!!\"\n\nA few hours after that Tuesday-morning Truth Social rant , Rep. Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas) followed through on Trump's suggestion, introducing an article of impeachment that charges Boasberg with \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" Specifically, Gill claims Boasberg \"abused the powers of his judicial authority\" by \"interfering with the President's constitutional prerogatives\" and his powers under the AEA, which in Gill's view gives Trump \"sole and unreviewable discretion\" to decide who qualifies as an \"alien enemy\" subject to immediate removal from the United States.\n\nAs Trump and Gill portray the situation, that understanding of the statute is completely uncontroversial. But if that were true, there would be no case for Boasberg to consider. Far from abusing his judicial authority, Boasberg is doing exactly what he is supposed to do as a federal judge: choosing between dueling interpretations of the law based on arguments and evidence presented in court-an adversarial process that continued at a hearing on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe attorneys representing the targets of Trump's AEA deportations argue that he is misapplying key terms in that rarely invoked 1798 statute, which is the last remaining vestige of the notoriously repressive Alien and Sedition Acts. The AEA applies only when \"there is a declared war\" between the United States and a \"foreign nation or government\" or when a \"foreign nation or government\" has \"perpetrated, attempted, or threatened\" an \"invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" In those circumstances, it authorizes the president to deport \"natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects\" of that \"hostile nation or government.\"\n\nUntil Trump took office in January, the AEA had been invoked only three times in 226 years: during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. All of those situations fell into the \"declared war\" category. The AEA has never previously been invoked in response to a putative \"invasion or predatory incursion\" outside the context of a declared war. That is the threat Trump cites to justify peremptorily deporting suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nIn a proclamation that Trump published last Saturday, he describes Tren de Aragua as \"a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.\" He says the gang \"is closely aligned with, and indeed has infiltrated,\" the Venezuelan government, \"including its military and law enforcement apparatus.\" He adds that \"Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations,\" including Tren de Aragua.\n\nThe result, Trump says, is \"a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States.\" This is the logic by which Trump counterintutively equates Tren de Aragua with a \"foreign nation or government.\" If you buy that, you may also accept his claim that supected members of Tren de Aragua qualify as \"natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects\" of a \"hostile nation or government.\" But you would also have to accept that the gang's \"brutal crimes, including murders, kidnappings, extortions, and human, drug, and weapons trafficking,\" amount to an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" under the AEA.\n\nAll of this seems like quite a stretch . Trump does not claim to be at war with Venezuela. Nor does he claim that the Venezuelan government has mounted an \"invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\" And a criminal organization, even one that has corrupted or \"infiltrated\" a foreign government, is not a \"hostile nation or government\" as those terms are ordinarily understood.\n\nNor does Trump's understanding of \"invasion or predatory incursion\" make sense in the context of the AEA. \"As the Supreme Court and past presidents have acknowledged, the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority enacted and implemented under the war power,\" Katherine Yon Ebright, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice who specializes in national security issues, explained last fall. \"When the Fifth Congress passed the law and the Wilson administration defended it in court during World War I, they did so on the understanding that noncitizens with connections to a foreign belligerent could be 'treated as prisoners of war' under the 'rules of war under the law of nations.' In the Constitution and other late-1700s statutes, the term invasion is used literally, typically to refer to large-scale attacks. The term predatory incursion is also used literally in writings of that period to refer to slightly smaller attacks like the 1781 Raid on Richmond led by American defector Benedict Arnold.\"\n\nEbright noted that \"some anti-immigration politicians and groups urge a non-literal reading of invasion and predatory incursion so that the Alien Enemies Act can be invoked in response to unlawful migration and cross-border narcotics trafficking.\" They view the statute as \"a turbocharged deportation authority.\" But that \"proposed reading of the law,\" Ebright argued, \"is at odds with centuries of legislative, presidential, and judicial practice, all of which confirm that the Alien Enemies Act is a wartime authority. Invoking it in peacetime to bypass conventional immigration law would be a staggering abuse.\" That is exactly what Trump is now trying to do.\n\nOn the same day that Trump officially invoked the AEA against alleged members of Tren de Aragua, Boasberg, who had already issued a temporary restraining order that blocked deportation of five named plaintiffs, held a hearing to consider extending the TRO to a class consisting of \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody\" who were covered by Trump's proclamation. The issue was urgent, since the Trump administration was on the verge of flying detainees to El Salvador, which happened that very evening. Boasberg heard from Lee Gelernt, the America Civil Liberties Union attorney representing the plaintiffs, and from Drew Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration.\n\n\"There is a lot of law about what constitutes a foreign government,\" Gelernt told Boasberg. \"And I don't think the United States recognizes [Tren de Aragua] as a foreign government. They recognize Venezuela as a foreign government. I think that's the historic understanding of the statute.\"\n\nGerlent also questioned the government's definition of \"invasion or predatory incursion\": \"We think the Court certainly can review whether immigration constitutes some kind of invasion....We know of no historical precedent that would suggest that straight migration or noncitizens coming and committing crimes constitutes an invasion within the meaning of the statute or the Constitution.\"\n\nWhile conceding \"there isn't a lot of precedent on this,\" Ensign cited the Supreme Court's 1948 decision in Ludecke v. Watkins , which allowed the pre-deportation detention of a German citizen after the end of World War II. In that case, he said, the Court \"recognized the very broad discretion of the president\" in deciding whether the AEA's \"declared war\" provision still applied.\n\nBoasberg conceded that \"the courts can't question the president's power to remove enemy aliens or even his determination that a state of war continues to exist.\" But he said the Supreme Court in Ludecke \"did seem to accept that courts could hear challenges to the construction and validity of the statute.\" If so, he asked Ensign, \"doesn't it leave open the [possibility] that judicial review is available to look at whether certain preconditions have been met for the president to invoke the statute?\"\n\nEnsign argued that such an inquiry would involve \"political questions\" that are not subject to judicial review. He added that the case \"cuts to the core of the president's Article II powers\" by challenging his authority over immigration and foreign policy.\n\nGelernt noted that Trump is not \"invoking his inherent authority under the Constitution.\" Rather, he said, Trump is \"invoking a specific statutory provision [for which] Congress has laid out very clear guidelines, and I think it would be fundamentally inconsistent with separation of powers for this Court not to be able to review whether those preconditions were met.\"\n\nAfter hearing from both sides, Boasberg noted that the case presents \"hard questions, close questions, and particularly hard questions on the expedited time frame that we are talking about here.\" But he said the plaintiffs had \"certainly presented a serious question that this is justiciable because it's outside of what Ludecke talked about.\" He thought they had made a plausible case that \"the AEA does not provide a basis for the president's proclamation given that the terms invasion and predatory incursion really relate to hostile acts perpetrated by enemy nations and commensurate to war.\" The plaintiffs also had plausibly argued that \"the terms nation and government do not apply to non-state actors like criminal gangs.\"\n\nBased on the arguments presented at that point, Boasberg said, \"I don't think the AEA provides a basis for removal under this proclamation.\" But he emphasized the preliminary nature of his order, which was aimed at preventing \"irreparable harm\" to the plaintiffs while the case was pending. In the meantime, he noted, the plaintiffs would remain in custody, which should be sufficient to address the government's public safety concerns.\n\nBoasberg issued a TRO that applies to \"all noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to the March 15, 2025, Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua' and its implementation.\" He told Ensign what that meant: \"Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States....However that's accomplished, whether turning around a plane or not embarking anyone on the plane...I leave to you. But this is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.\"\n\nSince then, Boasberg has been trying to figure out whether the Trump administration deliberately defied that order . That question hinges on the exact timing of the flights to El Salvador, where the deportees have been imprisoned. \"The government is not being terribly cooperative at this point,\" Boasberg said at Friday's hearing, \"but I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my order and who was responsible.\"\n\nThe flights that concern Boasberg did not include the five named plaintiffs, but they did include other Venezuelans covered by the broader TRO. On Monday, the White House described all of the deportees as \"ruthless terrorist gang members,\" quoting a long list of Republican politicians who likewise welcomed Trump's effort to rid the country of \"violent criminals,\" \"rapists,\" \"terrorists,\" \"drug dealers,\" and \"Tren de Aragua savages.\" But at least four of the named plaintiffs are asylum seekers who insist they are not in fact Tren De Aragua members. Two of them say they were identified as such based on nothing more than their nationality and misunderstood tattoos .\n\nAs Reason 's Eric Boehm notes , those claims underline the importance of the due process that Trump is trying to avoid by invoking the AEA. At Friday's hearing, The New York Times reports , Boasberg \"said he was concerned not only that President Trump has sought to use the [AEA] when there was neither an invasion taking place nor a declared state of war, but also that the people the government has sought to deport have no way of contesting whether they are actually gang members.\" He noted that \"the policy ramifications of this are incredibly troublesome and problematic and concerning.\"\n\nThose \"policy ramifications,\" Trump argues, are beyond Boasberg's purview. But the central question presented by this case is whether Trump is acting within his authority under the AEA. The answer is far less clear than he and his allies imply.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Trump Thinks the Feds Can Fix America's Critical Mineral Supply Chain\n\nTrump Administration\n\nJeff Luse | 3.21.2025 1:50 PM\n\nOn his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to unleash American energy by reducing regulations and shrinking the size of government. \"Burdensome and ideologically motivated regulations have impeded the development of [energy and natural resources], limited the generation of reliable and affordable electricity, reduced job creation, and inflicted high energy costs upon our citizens,\" the order read.\n\nTrump's campaign to downsize government involvement in energy and natural resources appears to be over. On Thursday, the president signed an executive order to expand the federal government's authority in domestic critical mineral production.\n\nSpecifically, the order invokes the Defense Production Act (DPA) to direct the secretary of defense \"to create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore domestic industrial base capabilities essential to the national defense\" by buying critical minerals, making subsidy payments for domestically produced materials and \"purchasing equipment for government and privately owned industrial facilities to expand their productive capacity.\"\n\nThe order confers DPA authority to federal agencies to issue loans and loan guarantees to shore up the supply of critical minerals \"or essential materials needed for defense purposes.\" Agencies are also directed to identify \"priority\" critical mineral projects and expedite their permitting process.\n\nThe DPA was passed during the Korean War to give presidents broad authority to \"influence domestic industry in the interest of national defense,\" according to the Congressional Research Service. National defense activities can include programs for military and energy production and homeland security or stockpiling. The DPA grants authority to the president (with minimal Congressional oversight) to prioritize and accept contracts for materials needed to secure national defense, use loans and loan guarantees to incentivize domestic manufacturing, and block foreign corporate mergers and acquisitions that \"undermine national security.\"\n\nUnilaterally granting the executive branch broad powers with little oversight has time and again led to wasteful spending. The first Trump administration used the DPA to expand the production of masks and vaccines for COVID-19, including issuing a $138 million grant to a medical supply company to develop an innovative syringe pre-filled with COVID-19 vaccine. The company failed to produce a single syringe to administer the vaccine .\n\nThe Biden administration used the DPA to supercharge domestic production of green energy and grid technology , circuit boards from Canada and the U.S., and critical minerals and mines . Legislation under the Biden administration-including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the second Ukraine funding package, and federal appropriations-gave the Department of Defense billions of dollars for DPA-related activities.\n\nThrough IRA funding, the Defense Department dolled out $250 million to 12 domestic critical mineral projects. The Loan Programs Office, which is administered by the Energy Department and whose budget was supercharged by the IRA, dispersed $2.6 billion to finance the construction of a lithium processing facility in Nevada.\n\nMore government involvement and funding have not bolstered America's critical mineral supply chain-the United States still largely relies on imports (especially from China) to meet the nation's demand-or fixed the regulatory issues that have shuttered domestic mining and processing for decades.\n\nIn his executive order, Trump says, \"It is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate domestic mineral production to the maximum possible extent.\" Increasing the federal government's reach in the economy is the wrong way to accomplish this objective.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Trump Fires Democratic FTC Commissioners\n\nTrump Administration\n\nJack Nicastro | 3.19.2025 3:15 PM\n\nPresident Donald Trump fired Democratic Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter on Tuesday. In so doing, Trump is ignoring a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent that restricts the removal of commissioners to \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,\" which could make the terminations illegal.\n\nAfter the firings, FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson said he had \"no doubts about [the president's] constitutional authority to remove Commissioners,\" citing Trump's possession of \"all of the executive power in our government.\" Bedoya disagreed, denouncing his firing as illegal in a post on X. He also shared a statement from Slaughter, who described the firings as \"violating the plain language of a statute and clear Supreme Court precedent.\"\n\nThe relevant precedent is the 1935 Supreme Court case Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. and the statute is the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 . The Court found \"it plain under the Constitution that illimitable power of removal is not possessed by the President\" because the power of Congress to create quasi-legislative agencies like the FTC includes \"power to fix the period during which they shall continue, and to forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime.\" The FTC itself was established and its commissioners were empowered to prosecute \"unfair methods of competition...and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,\" regardless of presidential administration.\n\nThomas Berry, director of the Cato Institute's Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Studies, tells Reason that Trump's firings represent \"a direct challenge to the Supreme Court precedent Humphrey's Executor , which held that Congress may protect the heads of certain 'independent agencies' from removal at will by the president.\"\n\nBerry argues that Humphrey's Executor was wrongly decided because \"the president's duty to enforce the law requires the ability to fire executive branch officials who are in disagreement with the president's views on how the law should be enforced.\" He suspects that, while lower courts will hold Trump's actions as illegal according to the precedent, \"the Supreme Court has the ability to overrule Humphrey's Executor [and] there is a good chance it will do so.\"\n\nGeoffrey A. Manne, president and founder of the International Center for Law and Economics, shares Berry's prediction. In an email to Reason , Manne says Humphrey's Executor \"is probably not long for this world, and thus, neither is the 'independence' of the FTC.\" Manne explains that the Federal Trade Commission Act requires that no more than three of the commissioners may be of the same political party. Accordingly, once Mark Meador, a Republican, is confirmed as FTC commissioner, \"the Commission can just go on as is indefinitely.\" Manne also notes that \"independent agency independence has always been more limited than people like to believe.\"\n\nEthan Yang, an adjunct research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research and an antitrust law scholar, expresses skepticism about the independence of agencies. \"There is nothing special about the FTC that suggests that employment protections are necessary or justified,\" he tells Reason. Moreover, Yang says that \"firing the two Democratic Commissioners would only make official what has been the reality for decades\": the inherent partisanship of the Commission. Yang points to both Democratic Commissioners voting \"in lockstep with the former Chair Lina Khan\" and \"redact[ing] the dissenting opinions of the lone Republican, Commissioner Christine Wilson,\" under the Biden administration.\n\nWhether Humphrey's Executor was decided rightly or wrongly, it is currently a binding precedent. Until the precedent is overruled by the Supreme Court, Trump's firings are illegal.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "God and the Don\n\nTwo days before his presidential inauguration, Donald Trump greeted a pair of visitors at his office in Trump Tower.\n\nAs a swarm of reporters waited in the gilded lobby, the Rev. Patrick O'Connor, the senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church in Queens, and the Rev. Scott Black Johnston, the senior pastor of Manhattan's Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, arrived to pray with the next president .\n\nFrom behind his desk on the 26th floor, Trump faced the Celtic cross at the top of the steeple of Johnston's church, located a block south on Fifth Avenue. When Johnston pointed it out to Trump, the President-elect responded by marveling at the thick glass on the windows of his office -- bulletproof panels installed after the election.\n\nIt was clear that Trump was still preoccupied with his November victory, and pleased with his performance with one constituency in particular.\n\n\"I did very, very well with evangelicals in the polls,\" Trump interjected in the middle of the conversation -- previously unreported comments that were described to me by both pastors.\n\nThey gently reminded Trump that neither of them was an evangelical.\n\n\"Well, what are you then?\" Trump asked.\n\nThey explained they were mainline Protestants, the same Christian tradition in which Trump, a self-described Presbyterian, was raised and claims membership. Like many mainline pastors, they told the President-elect, they lead diverse congregations.\n\nTrump nodded along, then posed another question to the two men: \"But you're all Christians?\"\n\nYes, we're all Christians.\n\nTrump is unique among modern American presidents for his seeming lack of deep religious orientation. He doesn't have a hometown church, and a months-long examination of the congregations he had ties to throughout his life found no evidence that Trump put down permanent roots in any of them. Congregants at his childhood church in Queens say Trump might not be welcome there today. The midtown Manhattan church he attended later in life has denied that he is a member there, and the son of its famous pastor, Norman Vincent Peale, has denounced Trump.\n\nTo Johnston, who along with O'Connor sought the meeting with Trump, his brief encounter with the incoming president underscored Trump's tenuous attachment to organized religion and his Christian upbringing.\n\nIt just clicked into place in my head, where I was like, 'Oh, this is a new Christian,'\" Johnston said. \"He is a Christian who's what I would call a young Christian. He is early on this journey. He has not spent a lot of time exploring the faith.\n\nIn recent history, presidents have turned to their faith in moments of crisis. Bill Clinton, a Baptist, called on the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the famed civil rights leader, to counsel his family in the fallout of his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The night before he announced his resignation, Richard Nixon, a Quaker, is said to have gotten down on his knees to pray in the Lincoln Sitting Room of the White House, weeping.\n\nTrump enters the summer mired in crisis as a special prosecutor investigates whether his campaign had inappropriate ties to Russia. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. But where other presidents have looked to religion for solace in times of political peril, there are few outward signs that faith has played a similar role in Trump's life.\n\nOn Inauguration Day, Trump and his family participated in the presidential tradition of attending services at St. John's Episcopal Church across from the White House. And Trump's first overseas trip as president in May included several moments of religious symbolism, such as a visit to the Western Wall in Israel, one of the holiest sites in Judaism, and a meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican.\n\nBut since becoming president, Trump has not regularly attended church. One recent exception was Easter, when the First Family worshipped at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida, where he and his wife, Melania, were married in 2005 and also attended Christmas Eve services soon after the election.\n\nTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks pushed back on the suggestion that the President appears to lack profound religious convictions, saying in an email: \"The President is a deeply faithful person.\" Hicks did not elaborate, other than to note that Trump is \"affiliated\" with Bethesda-by-the-Sea church.\n\nAsked whether Trump is a member of its congregation, the church's rector, the Rev. James Harlan, told CNN that the institution does not discuss its membership. Harlan also would not comment on whether he had any private conversations or meetings with Trump, saying his interactions with congregants are private.\n\nTrump's public comments about Christianity have been clumsy at times.\n\nPeople are so shocked when they find ... out I am Protestant. I am Presbyterian. And I go to church and I love God and I love my church.\n\nThe Bible means a lot to me, but I donât want to get into specifics.\n\nTwo Corinthians, 3:17, thatâs the whole ballgame.\n\nIf and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISISâs ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened.\n\nI think Islam hates us.\n\nTo be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion -- this is about terror and keeping our country safe.\n\nWe will not allow people of faith to be targeted, bullied or silenced anywhere.\n\nSoon after announcing his presidential bid, Trump described the experience of taking Communion as, \"When I drink my little wine -- which is about the only wine I drink -- and have my little cracker.\" In that same interview, Trump remarked that he wasn't sure he had ever asked God for forgiveness.\n\nTrump raised eyebrows again in January 2016 when he referred to the Second Corinthians Bible verse as \"Two Corinthians\" â a stumble that he later blamed on a religious leader who had advised him.\n\nEven the person considered to be Trump's closest spiritual confidant -- Florida pastor Paula White -- has said it would simply be \"futile\" and \"staged\" for Trump to try to publicly discuss his faith.\n\nThough Trump appeared unfamiliar with the nuances of Christianity during his January meeting with the pastors, his introduction to the religion dates back to childhood. Eleven miles away from Trump Tower across the East River in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens sits the First Presbyterian Church, where Trump was confirmed and attended during his formative years.\n\nThough he rarely discusses his faith, symbols of the church clearly hold personal significance. Trump used two Bibles at his swearing-in ceremony: one that was used by Abraham Lincoln, and another that is said to have been gifted by his mother around his ninth birthday after he graduated from primary Sunday school at First Presbyterian.\n\nBut it's not clear that Trump ever quite fit in at his childhood church in the 1950s, when there was a perceived division between the \"old money\" and \"new money\" families within the all-white congregation.\n\nAnd Trump would hardly belong there today.\n\nFirst Presbyterian is now almost entirely non-white, a reflection of the demographic changes in and around Jamaica over the decades. Many in the congregation vehemently reject some of the President's policies, particularly on immigration.\n\nPhilip Malebranche, a 58-year-old member of the church whose parents emigrated from Haiti, said Trump's controversial travel ban is entirely at odds with the diversity that First Presbyterian celebrates -- not to mention the religion's values.\n\nThe policies he's promoting go against our biblical teaching,\" Malebranche said. \"Our president should be representing us and not a minority of people.\n\nAsked whether Trump would be welcomed at the church, Malebranche asked: \"What spirit would the President bring to this congregation on a Sunday morning? I would be very skeptical.\"\n\nAtsu Ocloo, who recently became a US citizen after emigrating from Togo, said when he ran into a problem while applying for his green card, the church's pastor gave him money to apply for a new one.\n\nThe whole world is in this church,\" Ocloo, 48, said. \"Every day I pray for (Trump), so that the Holy Ghost should enlighten him.\n\nThe Feltons became the first black family to join the church in the late 1950s.\n\nJim Felton Sr., now 90, decided to take his family to First Presbyterian after they moved from Brooklyn to Queens. The decision was, in large part, a practical one: Felton and his wife didn't own a car. With four young children in tow, they would take a public bus and get off on Jamaica Avenue and 160th Street, and walk the four blocks to the church.\n\nBack in 1950, Jamaica Avenue was the dividing line,\" Felton said in a recent interview at his home in Covina, California. \"To the south was a predominantly black neighborhood, and to the north it was a predominantly white neighborhood. Over the years, it began to change.\n\nFelton and several other former and current members of the church that I interviewed recalled that Trump's late-father, real estate developer Fred Trump, was rarely -- if ever -- seen at the church. It was most always Trump's mother, Mary, a Scottish immigrant and devout Christian, who brought her son to Sunday school.\n\nBack then, it was no secret that the Trumps had money.\n\n\"The Trumps lived in Jamaica Estates, which was a very affluent neighborhood. Let's put it this way â where all the rich people live,\" Felton said.\n\nBut not all of the rich members were of equal wealth. Families of certain stature and lineage were described as \"old money.\" Families like the Trumps were considered \"new money.\"\n\nBorn\n\nConfirmed, First Presbyterian Church, Jamaica, New York\n\nMarried by Rev. Norman Vincent Peale to Ivana Trump at Marble Collegiate Church, Manhattan\n\nMarried by Dr. Arthur Caliandro of Marble Collegiate Church to Marla Maples, Plaza Hotel, Manhattan\n\nMarried by Rev. Ralph Warren Jr., to Melania Trump, Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea, Palm Beach, Florida\n\nTrump is inaugurated as 45th President of the United States with his hand on his childhood Bible and the one used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861\n\nHolly Hlaudun, 63, has attended First Presbyterian her entire life. Her 97-year-old mother, Chris Ferro, is the church's oldest and longest-attending member, and they are now among its few remaining white worshippers. Seven years Trump's junior, Hlaudun has a vague recollection of seeing him in Sunday school â enough to recall that \"he was just a little scary\" and that \"whenever he was in the hallway, I ducked into one of the classrooms.\"\n\nAs a child, she said she was aware that there were the members who were wealthy and others who were \"exceedingly well-off,\" like the two elderly sisters who often sat in the pew in front of Hlaudun's family, donning mink stoles and diamond chandelier earrings.\n\n\"There were differentials with the old money and the new money and middle class,\" Hlaudun said.\n\nJim Felton Jr. was about 9-years-old when his family joined First Presbyterian and said he attended some Sunday school classes with Trump. He described the President in his youth as somewhat of a \"loner,\" quiet in the classroom and seeming to want to fit in with the kids who hailed from legacy families. But he never quite seemed to.\n\n\"He was on the outside of the group,\" Felton Jr. said.\n\nAt first glance, the First Presbyterian Church of the 1950s where Trump received his earliest lessons in Christianity bears little resemblance to the church in the present day.\n\nOn a recent Sunday morning, the church's pews were filled almost entirely with people of color, many hailing from the Caribbean and Africa. O'Connor, the church's senior pastor who was born in the island nation of Jamaica, led a colorful service reflecting the diversity of his members, including some prayers recited in both Spanish and English.\n\nO'Connor estimates that around 10% of his congregation is undocumented. In the aftermath of Trump's executive order banning immigration from some Muslim-majority countries, fear spread throughout the church.\n\nSome are terrified, wondering on a daily basis whether they'll be stopped on their way to work. They pay taxes, they participate in regular life, yet wondering what kind of hostilities they will face,\" O'Connor told me in an extended interview. \"People have asked: 'Are our families going to be split up?'\n\nThere are explicit instructions in the Bible to embrace, support and protect immigrants, O'Connor said, and he considers them a \"fundamental teaching of the Bible.\"\n\nAsked whether he believes Trump has abided by those teachings as president, O'Connor paused before answering.\n\n\"The evidence says that he believes that America is better without some of the immigrants,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes I wonder what his mother, a Scottish immigrant, would think,\" O'Connor added, describing the hardships that Mary Trump and other immigrants from Europe would have faced many years ago when they arrived in the United States. \"I think that those values and that experience may have been forgotten by Mr. Trump.\n\nTrump rarely talks about his mother, a housewife who raised Trump and his four siblings. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last year, Trump described her as \"one of the most honest and charitable people that I have ever known, and a great, great judge of character.\"\n\nThough O'Connor has extended invitations for the President to return to his home church, the pastor has had limited interactions with Trump other than the January meeting at Trump Tower. Around the church's 350th anniversary in 2012, Trump sent a \"generous\" check, O'Connor said, and also sent the pastor a copy of his book, \"Time to Get Tough.\"\n\nInside was a handwritten note: \"Keep up the great work.\"\n\nThe Sunday after Election Day, the Secret Service reached out early in the morning to Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. They wanted to know whether the First Family could attend that morning's services.\n\nAccording to Johnston, the church's senior pastor, Secret Service inquired about closing the Fifth Avenue entrance for Trump and his family.\n\nWhile the church's policy is to welcome any and all worshippers, the last-minute security request was problematic. It was Pledge Sunday, and more than 1,000 people were expected to attend. The church made clear that having everyone funnel through the only other entrance on 55th Street would be a logistical nightmare.\n\nAs the church fretted over what to do, in just a matter of minutes, it received word again: the Trumps would not be attending after all.\n\nThe hasty outreach to Fifth Avenue Presbyterian, the church closest to Trump Tower but which Trump has never attended, was another sign, some say, of his lack of an ongoing relationship with any one congregation.\n\nAt another point in Trump's life, he might have looked to a different church in midtown Manhattan. After attending First Presbyterian in Queens, Trump and his family eventually switched to Marble Collegiate, home to Peale, a famous pastor.\n\nPeale's 1950s bestseller, \"The Power of Positive Thinking,\" made him an internationally acclaimed motivational speaker. His speeches attracted thousands who believed that Peale's techniques could enrich their lives, including their bank accounts.\n\nTenets from \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" may have left a lasting impression on young Trump at a time when he sought to follow in his father's footsteps and expand his family's real estate empire.\n\nIn one chapter titled, \"I Don't Believe in Defeat,\" Peale wrote: \"If you are thinking thoughts of defeat, I urge you to rid yourself of such thoughts, for as you think defeat you tend to get it.\" A later chapter offers advice on \"how to get people to like you,\" with Peale writing that \"the longing to be liked, to be held in esteem, to be a sought-after person, is fundamental in us.\"\n\nTrump and Peale, who died in 1993, developed a personal relationship. The pastor officiated the President's first marriage to Ivana Trump.\n\nBut Donald Trump has seldom spoken about Peale as a religious influence. If the pastor's sermons shaped Trump's worldview, there is little indication that they made him a man of deep faith. In a New York Times story last year about Trump and Peale, Trump praised him as a \"great preacher and a great public speaker,\" but had nothing to say about his religious teachings.\n\nPeale's son, John, has harshly rebuked Trump. He told The Washington Post at the height of the 2016 election that he winces whenever the candidate invokes his father's name on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I cringe,\" Peale said. \"I don't respect Mr. Trump very much. I don't take him very seriously. I regret the publicity of the connection. This is a problem for the Peale family.\n\nReached on the phone, Peale's daughter, Elizabeth Peale Allen, told me that the family has decided not discuss Trump with the press out of \"deference to our father and his legacy.\"\n\nMarble, for its part, also distanced itself from Trump during the campaign.\n\nWhen Trump told reporters that he attended Marble, the church took the rare step of publicly rejecting that claim, saying in a statement that Trump was \"not an active member\" of the church. (Marble declined to participate in this story.)\n\nFour months after his inauguration, Trump still appears obsessed with -- at times even amazed by -- his victory. (\"Hey, I'm president. Can you believe it?\" a smiling Trump said in the Rose Garden in early May as he celebrated the House passage of a Republican health care bill.)\n\nWithout a church to quite call his own, the President has suggested that his unlikely ascendance to the White House may not have been possible were it not for something beyond his control: divine intervention.\n\n\"Right here, the class of 2017 dressed in cap and gown, graduating to a totally brilliant future,\" Trump said last month in a commencement address at Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg, Virginia. \"And here I am standing before you as President of the United States.\n\n\"I'm guessing there are some people here today who thought that either one of those things, either one, would really require major help from God,\" he continued. \"And we got it.\n\nPhotography by Caroll Taveras\n\nHow dating in New York is changing under the new administration\n\nIn this issue of STATE, we aim to capture American life one year after the unprecedented 2016 race.\n\nThe divided era of politics didn't start with Trump's victory.

That seems unlikely for Trump.\n\nThe First Daughter's unique role at a time of rising anti-Semitism\n\nThe human line of protection at the border\n\nWhether you think he's draining the swamp or destroying the country, there's no denying that the America we live in today is strikingly different than the one Barack Obama handed over on January 20.\n\nThe President reaches this symbolic moment with the lowest approval rating of any of his predecessors at this point. Can he turn it around?\n\nThe freshman senator is at the center of 2020 buzz. But can she live up to the hype?\n\nCampus leaders rethink their role in the age of Trump.\n\nMy memories of an aggressive effort to lead our experiment in mock government.\n\nHere's what the naysayers are getting wrong.\n\nThe goal of STATE is to capture this moment in America's political culture, which is exhilarating for those unnerved by what they see as the country's progressive, globalist tilt under Obama and anxiety-provoking for those who unexpectedly find that approach locked out of power in Washington.\n\nIt seems we can't find what you're looking for."

      "text": "Trump's Judge Bashing Provokes a Rebuke From Chief Justice John Roberts (Again)\n\nTrump Administration\n\nJacob Sullum | 3.19.2025 3:30 PM\n\n\"For more than two centuries,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said on Tuesday, \"it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.\"\n\nAlthough Roberts did not mention Donald Trump, the timing suggested he was responding to a Tuesday-morning Truth Social rant in which the president declared that federal judges who impede his agenda \"should be IMPEACHED!!!\" That recommendation echoed presidential adviser Elon Musk's oft-repeated solution to the inconvenience of judicial review-a prescription that would undermine the rule of law by punishing judges for daring to disagree with the president.\n\nTrump's post referred specifically to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is considering a challenge to deportations based on the rarely invoked Alien Enemies Act. That 1798 law authorizes the president to deport \"natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects\" of a \"hostile nation or government\" when there is \"a declared war\" with that nation or government or it has mounted an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" The law does not provide much in the way of due process, although it does charge judges with conducting \"a full examination and hearing\" of each complaint against \"any alien enemy resident.\" The Trump administration controversially argues that the law can be applied to suspected members of Latin American gangs.\n\nTrump described Boasberg as \"this Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge, a troublemaker and agitator who was sadly appointed by Barack Hussein Obama.\" Boasberg, Trump noted, \"was not elected President\" and \"DIDN'T WIN ANYTHING!\" Trump, by contrast, \"WON FOR MANY REASONS, IN AN OVERWHELMING MANDATE, BUT FIGHTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MAY HAVE BEEN THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS HISTORIC VICTORY.\" Since Trump is \"just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do,\" he argued, Boasberg has no business interfering. And if he insists on doing so, Trump said, he should be impeached, and so should \"many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before.\"\n\nA few hours after that post, Rep. Brandon Gill (R-Texas) said he had introduced an article of impeachment against Boasberg, charging the \"radical activist\" with \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\" The article says Boasberg violated his oath of office by \"us[ing] his judicial position to advance political gain while interfering with the President's constitutional prerogatives.\" The Alien Enemies Act, Gill says, gives the president \"sole and unreviewable discretion\" to \" determine whether an invasion has taken place\" (and also, presumably, to decide what counts as a \"hostile nation or government\"), meaning that Boasberg \"has abused the powers of his judicial authority\" even by considering whether that law authorizes the deportations of alleged gang members.\n\nLast Saturday, Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order aimed at halting those deportations while the case is pending. He is now trying to figure out whether the Trump administration deliberately defied that order by proceeding with the deportations anyway.\n\n\"I'd be open to impeaching judges for persistent bad-faith or wild rulings,\" says conservative legal commentator Ed Whelan. But he sees \"nothing remotely like that here.\" In fact, he says, \"Judge Boasberg's critics have yet to make a clear and compelling case that his order was wrong.\" Whelan adds that \"impeachment threats are at best performative nonsense,\" and he worries that \"they may provoke threats of violence against judges and family members.\"\n\nEven without delving into the legal merits of Boasberg's order or Trump's weird interpretation of the Alien Enemies Act, it should be obvious that something is wrong with the president's assertion that his electoral mandate precludes judges from reviewing his decisions. Musk makes the same basic argument, saying \"federal judges who repeatedly abuse their authority to obstruct the will of the people via their elected representatives should be impeached.\" Trump and Musk seem oblivious to the fact that judges are supposed to \"obstruct the will of the people\" when it is inconsistent with the law. Judges may be wrong in reaching that conclusion. But as Roberts noted, that is why \"the normal appellate review process exists.\"\n\nAlthough chief justices rarely make such public pronouncements, this is not the first time Roberts has felt compelled to take a stand in defense of judicial independence. \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,\" Roberts said in 2018 after Trump condemned the \"Obama judge\" who had ruled against one of his immigration policies. \"What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them. That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.\"\n\nTwo years later, Roberts delivered a similar rebuke, this time in response to inflammatory comments that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had made at an abortion-rights rally outside the Supreme Court. \"They're taking away fundamental rights,\" Schumer said as the justices considered the constitutionality of a Louisiana law requiring that physicians who perform abortions have admitting privileges at local hospitals. Turning to point at the Supreme Court building, he angrily added: \"I want to tell you, [Justice Neil] Gorsuch, I want to tell you, [Justice Brett] Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price! You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\"\n\nRoberts thought that Schumer, like Trump, had crossed a line. \"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory,\" he said , \"but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All Members of the Court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter.\"\n\nIn both of those cases, Roberts thought it was important to remind the public that the judicial branch plays a crucial role in our system of government by ensuring that the other two branches are complying with statutory and constitutional requirements. Reflexive threats of impeachment against judges who issue decisions that politicians do not like implicate the same concern. No matter what you think of any particular ruling, letting politicians do whatever they want, as long as they can claim that voters support it, would replace constitutional democracy with, at best, tyranny of the majority. More realistically, it would subject all Americans to the unbridled whims of any demagogue who manages to gain power.\n\nStart your day with Reason .
