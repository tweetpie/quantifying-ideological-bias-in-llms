      "text": "Fifty Years Ago, the Supreme Court Knocked Down Bans on Interracial Marriage - How Have Things Changed Since Then?\n\nShould we allow states to decide whether black Americans may marry white Americans? Today, such an idea seems absurd. Most Americans believe that states shouldn't be permitted to trample on the basic right of interracial couples to marry. It would be unfair and a clear violation of civil rights. But until 50 years ago (June 12, 1967), when the Supreme Court knocked down state laws banning interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia , 16 states still had such laws on the books. At the time, 72% of Americans opposed marriage between blacks and whites.\n\nBack then, the Supreme Court was far ahead of public opinion. In fact, it wasn't until the mid-1990s that even half of Americans said they approved of such interracial marriages. In 2013, the most recent poll on the topic, 87% of Americans-including 84% of whites and 96% of blacks-supported interracial marriage. It may be shocking to some that 13% of Americans still disapprove of black-white marriages, but the shift in public opinion over five decades has been steady and irreversible. Equally important, 96% of Americans younger than 30, and 83% of those who live in the South, now support interracial marriage.\n\nSince Loving v. Virginia , the number of interracial marriages has steadily increased, even in the South. In 1967, only 3% of newlyweds were intermarried. By 2015, that share had risen to 17%, according to the Pew Research Center.  Only 10% of recent white newlyweds are intermarried but the number is higher in different parts of the country, including some parts of the South, including 27% in the San Antonio area, 20% in the Orlando, Florida and Tucson, Arizona areas, 19% in the Fayetteville, N.C. area, 15% in the Dallas-Forth Worth area, and 14% in greater Oklahoma City.\n\nIn 1967, Southern racists used \"states' rights\" as the justification to defend Jim Crow laws, including school segregation, racial discrimination in restaurants and on buses, severe limits on voting by African Americans, and bans on interracial marriage. More recently, opponents of marriage equality used the same rationale, claiming that marriage laws should be left to the states to decide. Indeed, the Loving ruling became a precedent in federal court decisions ruling that bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional, including in the landmark Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015.\n\nJeff Nichols' 2016 film, \"Loving,\" focused on the brave couple who brought their interracial marriage suit to the Supreme Court, and the inexperienced but savvy attorneys who represented them. The film's title is not a plea for compassion and understanding; it is the last name of the plaintiffs, a working-class couple who simply wanted to live as husband and wife and raise their children in Virginia, where they had been born and where they and their extended families lived.\n\nIn June 1958, Mildred Jeter, who was black, and Richard Loving, a white bricklayer, drove 90 miles from their home in Central Point in rural Virginia and got married in Washington, D.C., to circumvent Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which then made interracial marriage a crime. Six weeks later, the local police raided their home at 2am, hoping to find them having sex, which was also a crime for interracial couples in Virginia. The cops found the couple asleep in bed. Richard showed them the marriage certificate on the bedroom wall.\n\n\"That's no good here,\" the sheriff responded. In fact, the document was used as evidence that the Lovings had violated Virginia law. The Lovings were charged with \"cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.\"\n\nIn his ruling, Leon M. Bazile, the Virginia trial judge wrote:\n\n\"Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\"\n\nOn January 6, 1959, the Lovings pled guilty, and Bazile sentenced them to one year in prison. The judge offered to suspend their sentence if they agreed to leave the state for 25 years. They agreed, and reluctantly moved to Washington, D.C. In defiance of the agreement, they secretly moved back to Virginia and soon found themselves in the middle of a controversial legal battle.\n\nLike two previous movies about this case-\"Mr. and Mrs. Loving\" (a 1996 made-for-TV drama) and \"The Loving Story\" (a 2011 documentary) - \"Loving\" makes clear that neither Richard (played by Joel Edgerton) nor Mildred (Ruth Negga) were political activists. Poor, without much education, they had grown up in the small town of Central Point, where interracial mixing-if not marriage-had been the norm. They knew that their marriage was unusual, but initially they weren't looking to change the law or embark on a crusade. The phrase \"civil rights\" pops up in the film only when one of Mildred's relatives tells her, while watching Martin Luther King Jr. on television, \"You need to get you some civil rights.\"\n\nMildred got the idea to write to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy for help. Kennedy referred her to the American Civil Liberties Union, which agreed to take their case. The two ACLU lawyers, Bernard Cohen and Philip Hirschkop, were young and untested, but they were also persistent and clever. In November 1963, the two lawyers filed a motion in the state trial court to reverse the Lovings' sentence on the grounds that it violated the Constitution's 14th Amendment. It took four years to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. In the interim years, the civil-rights movement galvanized America and stirred its conscience about racial injustice. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Change was in the air. But interracial marriage was the last taboo. Given public opinion at the time, it was an issue Congress was unlikely to confront but that the Supreme Court might tackle.\n\nIn 1967, Chief Justice Earl Warren, the moderate Republican who had skillfully engineered a unanimous 9-0 vote in the Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation case in 1954, still led the court. As with the earlier case, Warren believed that the nation needed to see the Supreme Court united on the potentially explosive issue of interracial marriage.\n\nIt was certainly, in today's parlance, no slam dunk. Five of Warren's Supreme Court colleagues had been appointed by Democratic presidents-William O. Douglas and Hugo Black by Franklin Roosevelt, Tom Clark by Harry Truman, Byron White by John F. Kennedy, and Abe Fortas by Lyndon Johnson-but they espoused different views on a variety of legal and social issues.\n\nAs Southern Democrats, Black and Clark understood how explosive the Loving case would be. Black, who had represented Alabama in the U.S. Senate from 1927 to 1937, no doubt felt guilt over his racist past. In 1926, when running for the Senate, Black had joined the Ku Klux Klan, thinking he needed its members' votes. He spoke at Klan meetings, espousing anti-black and anti-Catholic views.\n\nNear the end of his life, Black would admit that joining the Klan was a mistake, but also said, \"I would have joined any group if it helped get me votes.\" In 1929, Black wrote to a constituent denouncing an interracial marriage in New York, observing that \"New York State should have a law prohibiting this sort of thing,\" according to a biography by Roger Newman. In the Senate, Black was an ardent New Dealer, but hardly a progressive on racial issues. He consistently opposed the passage of anti-lynching legislation, and even led a filibuster of an anti-lynching bill.\n\nClark, a Texan, was an assistant to U.S. Attorney General Biddle when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. Biddle named Clark to be Civilian Coordinator of the Alien Enemy Control Program that interned Japanese Americans and other supposed enemies of the United States. Like Warren, Clark later acknowledged that internment had been a mistake. Appointed attorney general by Truman in 1945, Clark helped formulate and carry out Truman's aggressive Cold War anti-communist policies, including requiring federal employees to sign loyalty oaths and helping blacklist liberals and radicals. But Clark also played a key role in supporting Truman's civil-rights efforts. He filed a brief in the landmark (and controversial) Shelley v. Kraemer case that in 1948, struck down racial covenants in housing contracts that had restricted real-estate sales to blacks. He also helped oversee Truman's civil-rights committee that released an important report, To Secure These Rights, which had 35 recommendations that included ending segregation and poll taxes, laws to protect voting rights, and the creation of a civil-rights division in the Department of Justice.\n\nThat case once again demonstrated Warren's skills at persuading his colleagues into a unanimous decision.\n\nThree of Warren's Supreme Court colleagues-John Harlan, William Brennan, and Potter Stewart-had, like Warren, been appointed by Republican President Dwight Eisenhower. Harlan was a conservative who nevertheless often voted in favor of civil rights-in the same mold as his grandfather and namesake, the only dissenting justice in the landmark 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case that upheld the constitutionality of state segregation laws under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nBut Harlan was also the lone dissenter in the 1964 Reynolds v. Sims decision, which established the \"one man, one vote\" principle that ensured equal protection under the 14th Amendment. In 1956, Eisenhower appointed Brennan-a Republican-appointed federal judge in New Jersey-for purely political reasons. Brennan was a Democrat and a Catholic, and Eisenhower, who was running for re-election, wanted to appeal to both constituencies. Only one senator, Republican Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, voted against Brennan's confirmation. Stewart was from a prominent conservative Ohio family, and a frequent Warren Court dissenter, but in the 1965 case Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham , he ruled with the majority to bar police from using an anti-loitering law to prevent civil-rights activists from standing or demonstrating sidewalks, a clear civil-rights victory. That case demonstrated once again Warren's skills at persuading his colleagues into a unanimous decision. The justices deciding that case no doubt recognized that, despite the fact that many Americans still opposed interracial marriage, the tide of history was turning, and they wanted to be on the right side.\n\nIn their landmark ruling, Loving v. Virginia , the Supreme Court struck down all state anti-miscegenation laws and declared marriage to be an inherent right. Warren penned the opinion for the court, noting that the Virginia law endorsed the doctrine of white supremacy. He wrote:\n\n\"Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our very existence and survival. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination.\"\n\nThe Lovings don't even bother to attend the court hearing. Richard Loving simply said to one of the attorneys, \"Tell the judge I love my wife and it is just unfair that I can't live with her in Virginia.\"\n\nAt the time, most Americans did not accept that simple statement. Public opinion, particularly in the South, lagged behind the court's ruling. In 1969, two years after the Loving ruling, members of Georgia's state legislature and Board of Regents objected to hiring former Secretary of State Dean Rusk to a teaching job at the University of Georgia because he had participated in his daughter's wedding to a black man. Although the Loving ruling had invalidated state laws banning interracial marriage, many Southern states were slow to erase their own laws. South Carolina didn't repeal its law until 1998; Alabama didn't do so until 2000.\n\nIf one rereads Warren's words in Loving v. Virginia , and substitutes the term \"same-sex marriage\" for \"interracial marriage,\" the argument is no less compelling. Most Americans now agree that to deny gays and lesbians the right to marry is, as Warren wrote in Loving, \"directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nThe civil-rights movement laid the foundation for the gay-rights crusade, which adopted many of its strategies and tactics, including grassroots organizing, protest and civil disobedience, court challenges, lobbying, and campaigning to elect sympathetic candidates.\n\nAfter the gay-rights movement burgeoned in the 1970s, more and more public figures - politicians, entertainers, teachers, judges, journalists, businesspersons, athletes, and clergy members - acknowledged their homosexuality. TV sitcoms began to feature openly gay characters. In 2002, the New York Times began publishing announcements of same-sex civil unions and weddings. Massachusetts Democrat Gerry Studds came out of the closet in 1983-the first member of Congress to do this. Now there are six openly gay and lesbian members in the House and one, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, in the U.S. Senate. All 50 states now have at least one openly gay elected official, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. In 2013, NBA player Jason Collins became the first pro athlete on a major American sports team to come out of the closet. The following year, Apple's Tim Cook became the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 corporation.\n\nAs gay activism accelerated, attitudes changed. Americans who believe that people \"choose\" to be gay fell from 40% in 1994 to 25% in 2014.\n\nAs advocates began to put specific issues on the agenda, public support increased for openly gay public school teachers, health benefits for gay partners, gay adoption, AIDS research funding, and for campaigns to end anti-sodomy laws, anti-LGBT workplace and housing discrimination, and hate crimes against gays. Support for gays serving openly in the military rose from 44% in 1993, to more than 75% in 2008. In 2010, President Obama signed legislation ending the government's 17-year \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.\n\nAs with interracial marriage, more and more people have confronted an issue that was once taboo. A growing number of Americans have realized that they know gay people. In 1992, only 52% of Americans said that they knew someone who was gay or lesbian. By 2010, that figure had increased to 76%. Not surprisingly, people who know someone who is gay or lesbian voice less disapproval, higher comfort levels, and greater support for same-sex marriage, polls have found.\n\nIn 1996, only 27% of Americans believed it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to marry. By this year, that number had increased to 64%, a new high, according to the Gallup Poll .\n\nMoreover, support for gay marriage is much higher among younger Americans. Among millennials (18-29 year olds), 83% endorse gay marriage. But support has also been increasing among older Americans. Among Americans over 65 (born before 1951), support for same-sex marriage has increased to 53%.\n\nAccording to the latest poll , 74% of Democrats, 71% of independents, and 47% of Republicans favor same-sex marriage.\n\nIn June 2015, in its Obergefell v. Hodges decision, the Supreme Court overturned state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage, thus legalizing marriage equality throughout the country. In some ways, the ruling followed in the footsteps of Loving v. Virginia, but the two verdicts also differ substantially. The Loving decision was unanimous. The Obergefell ruling on same-sex marriage was decided narrowly by 5 to 4.\n\nFour members of the nation's highest court - Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia (now deceased), and Clarence Thomas-opposed marriage equality. Each had his own public and private justifications, but history will record that all four of them supported states' rights over equal rights, bigotry over tolerance. Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Anthony Kennedy (who cast the swing vote) will be remembered for embracing the notion that marriage is a matter of personal choice. Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, cited Loving v. Virginia several times, explaining that it had established an \"abiding connection between marriage and liberty.\"\n\nDuring last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump flip-flopped on the subject of marriage equality numerous times. At one point he promised to appoint justices to erase the Supreme Court's 2015 Obergefell ruling. Later he said that his personal views on same-sex marriage are \"irrelevant,\" claiming that the case \"was already settled.\"  As president, he signed a \"religious freedom\" executive order in May that gives Attorney General Jeff Sessions authority to interpret existing federal laws and regulations in a way that could result in discrimination against LGBT people in health care, education, housing, and employment by allowing businesses to refuse services or jobs to gays and lesbians if doing so offends their religious beliefs.  The Trump administration has also revoked protections for transgender school students.  Trump refused to endorse this month's Gay Pride celebrations, events previously marked by White House support.\n\nEven if Neil Gorsuch, Trump's one Supreme Court pick, opposes same-sex marriage, the current line-up of justices would not likely overturn Obergefell ruling, since five of them had already voted in support of same-sex marriage. But if Trump gets to select another justice, all bets are off.  And if Trump is forced to resign and Vice President Mike Pence becomes president, we'd have a much stronger opponent of marriage equality in the White House.  In 2015, as Indiana governor, Pence signed the country's first state religious freedom bill - allowing individuals and businesses to deny services they feel are contrary to their religious beliefs.\n\nRepublican efforts to weaken laws protecting LGBT persons from discrimination may play to their current base, but American attitudes have changed dramatically in the past few decades. Homophobia has not disappeared. A hard core of anti-gay Americans, including some politicians and clergy members, still generate headlines. But their followers are shrinking. The gay-rights movement has clearly won Americans' hearts and minds. The days of gay-bashing as a political strategy are numbered.\n\nMildred and Richard Loving's struggle foreshadowed the more recent battle over same-sex marriage. Perhaps not surprisingly, Mildred Loving embraced the idea of marriage equality for gays and lesbians before she died in 2008.  In June 2007, on the 40th anniversary of the case that bore her name, she issued the following statement:\n\n\"I believe all Americans, no matter their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual orientation, should have that same freedom to marry. Government has no business imposing some people's religious beliefs over others. Especially if it denies people's civil rights. I am still not a political person, but I am proud that Richard's and my name is on a court case that can help reinforce the love, the commitment, the fairness, and the family that so many people, black or white, young or old, gay or straight seek in life. I support the freedom to marry for all. That's what Loving, and loving, are all about.\""

      "text": "President Joe Biden signs historic same-sex and interracial marriage protections into law\n\nIn front of a crowd of nearly 3,000 people, President Joe Biden (D) signed the Respect for Marriage Act, a law which officially repealed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the 1996 law that forbade the federal government from legally recognizing same-sex marriages.\n\nThe law also requires the federal and state governments to recognize same-sex marriages as long as they occur in states where they are legal. If any state refuses to recognize such marriages the spouses can sue under the new law.\n\n\"Racism, antisemitism, homophobia, transphobia: They're all connected,\" Biden said before signing the law, according to LGBTQ Nation . \"The antidote to hate is love. This law and beloved defense strike a blow against hate in all its forms. And that's why this law matters to every single American, no matter who you are or who you love.\"\n\nThe D.C. Gay Men's Chorus, nonbinary singer Sam Smith, and longtime LGBTQ ally Cyndi Lauper all performed for the crowd before Biden signed the law.\n\n169 House Members and 36 Senators voted against the bill , which also protects interracial marriages. All were Republicans. Republicans also tried to derail its passage by adding amendments that would've allowed people the right to discriminate based on sincerely held religious beliefs, effectively hollowing out any civil rights protections that come with legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nThirty-five states still have same-sex marriage bans on their books . If the Supreme Court ever overturns the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriages, those states will be able to stop offering marriage to same-sex residents.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act ensures that U.S. citizens will be able to travel to other states with legalized same-sex marriages and have those marriages recognized at the state and federal levels."

      "text": "A 'disaster for Indiana': Mike Braun's constituents revolt after GOP senator criticized legalization of interracial marriage\n\nSen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) is facing serious blow back for his remarks arguing the legalization of interracial marriage should not have been a U.S. Supreme Court ruling but rather a decision left to individual states. The controversial remarks came during the confirmation hearings held for President Joe Biden's SCOTUS justice nominee,  Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nAt one point during his questioning of Brown Jackson, Brau complained about what he described as \"judicial activism\" as he highlighted a number of historic rulings he appeared to have issues - with interracial marriage being one of them.\n\n\"When it comes to issues, you can't have it both ways,\" Braun said. \"When you want that diversity to shine within our federal system, there are going to be rules and proceedings, they're going to be out of sync with maybe what other states would do. It's the beauty of the system, and that's where the differences among points of view in our 50 states ought to express themselves.\"\n\nShortly after making the remarks, Braun attempted to backpedal. In a statement offering further explanation for his remarks, the Indiana lawmaker wrote: \"Let me be clear on that issue - there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form, at all levels, and by any states, entities, or individuals.\"\n\nHowever, that still wasn't enough to quell the critical reactions that followed. Shortly after reports began circulating about Braun's remarks, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, political candidates, Indiana residents and other Twitter users began flooding the social network with critical reactions.\n\nMike Schmuhl, who serves as the Indiana Democratic Party's chairman, quickly fired back with blistering comments in response to Braun's remarks which he described as \"un-American.\"\n\n\"The United States Supreme Court has affirmed many times that marriage equality in our country extends to any committed couple regardless of sex, race, orientation, or religious affiliation, and to question that legitimacy questions the very fabric of America and its people,\" Schmuhl said.\n\nSchmuhl went on to slam the Republican Party's \"culture wars\" which he believes are impacting America's future.\n\n\"Democrats implore all Hoosiers to ask themselves if they want to be associated with someone as embarrassing as Mike Braun and a form of partisanship that endorses white nationalist views - because these are the same views that led to the insurrection against our nation on January 6, 2021,\" he said. \"If Mike Braun wants to question the legitimacy of anything, it should be his own standing as a United States Senator. He cheated his way into office and consistently shows that he does not represent us.\"\n\nHowever, Democrats aren't the only ones slamming Braun for his remarks. Some Republican lawmakers and candidates have also pushed back in disagreement. Speaking to The Indy Star in an emailed statement, Indiana Republican Party chairman Kyle Hupfer said he believes \"some rights are so 'intrinsic' that they cannot be left up to states, and one of those is ensuring 'racial equality.'\"\n\n\"As for my thoughts on the issue at hand, I believe there are some rights that are so intrinsic to us as humans and Americans that the states cannot be left to decide those issues on their own,\" Hupfer said. \"That includes ensuring racial equality in all aspects of life.\"\n\nOthers took to Twitter to express their concerns. \"It is appalling that a US Senator from IN claims that the US Supreme Ct shouldn't decide the right of people to marry inter-racially,\" tweeted Mayor Thomas McDermott (D), who is running for the Indiana Senate. \"I condemn [ Senator Braun ] 's comments and I urge [ Sen. Todd Young ] to join me in condemning views that should be left behind in our nation's past.\n\nFrom a second Twitter account, McDermott tweeted, \"The modern-day GOP has become a disgrace. Comments like these, from a sitting US Senator, were wrong in the 1950's, and are appalling in the year 2022. It's up to us #Hoosiers to take care of business and drive backwards thinking politicians out of Washington DC.\"\n\nMembers of interracial families have also pushed back against Braun for his offensive remarks.\n\nWhile some Twitter users expressed frustration over Braun's remarks and antics from other Republican lawmakers, other users mocked the lawmaker for his blunder.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) went a step further in dissecting Braun's statement. The lawmaker shared her interpretation of his statement as she challenged him to speak publicly again and denounce his previous remarks.\n\n\"Senator Braun's statement does not walk back what he said,\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nShe concluded, \"He needs to go on the record to clarify whether he believes states should be allowed to reinstate anti-miscegenation laws, and whether it's his belief SCOTUS should overturn Loving v. Virginia as he does w/ Roe v. Wade.\""

      "text": "11 Interracial Romances that Changed America\n\nRemember your first interracial kiss? If not, chances are you've at least read about one or seen one on TV or film. And chances are the relationship ended in tragedy. Since slavery, American artists have imagined interracial desire as a danger to black women or to white purity or a moral crisis. Since it was impossible to imagine racism ending, in the narratives, society overpowered the lovers and they died or were split. Tragedy is the default genre for interracial romance in American culture.\n\nOnly recently do we see interracial desire that doesn't end in death or failure, which means that art is finally catching up with real life. Mixed marriages are on the rise. Our president is the child of an interracial romance. We are on the precipice of post-racial storytelling in the genre of romantic love. As the taboo breaks down, it helps to look back on the history of interracial romance in American art.\n\n1. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (1845) and Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Jacobs (1861)\n\nLiterature, not cinema, shaped public sentiment in 19th Century America. Black authors wrote that interracial desire was not romance, but rape. Sexual violence was a means of social control and wealth production. And the black female body was the site of violation. Frederick Douglass wrote of \"the whisper that my master was my father\" and escaped slave turned memoirist. Harriet Jacobs wrote how at 15 years old, \"my master began to whisper foul words in my ear\" and tried to rape her. Slave narratives set for the liberal mind the image of white male violence on black women.\n\n2. Clotel or The President's Daughter by William Wells Brown (1853)\n\nClotel was the first novel of this genre (based on Thomas Jefferson's slave Sally Hemmings) to use the genres of romantic love and tragedy. The title character is a light-skinned slave who is the concubine of a white man. They love each other and have a child, but he sells them into slavery after marrying a white woman. Clotel escapes, but when cornered by slave catchers on a bridge, she throws herself into the river and dies. It is an early use of the \"Tragic Mulatto\" caricature, a mixed-race woman torn between races. Clotel repeated the trope of white male violence on black women in the form of betrayal.\n\n3. Birth of a Nation (1915), based on the book The Clansmen by Thomas Dixon (1905)\n\nBirth of a Nation remains the most racist film ever made. Aside from the Ku Klux Klan being championed as heroes, we see Union soldier Gus as the Brute caricature, an animal-like black male who tries to rape white women. Sharing screen time is Silas Lynch (George Siegmann) a \"mulatto\" orator who tries to force a white woman to marry him. In the racist mind, interracial desire from black men is a danger to be controlled through violence.\n\n4. Imitation of Life (1959)\n\nLike the earlier 1934 film, 1959's Imitation of Life follows the tragic genre in which a light-skinned black woman Sarah Jane (Susan Kohner) wants to pass for white. She is in love with a young white man who savagely beats her when he discovers she is black. Again the \"Tragic Mulatto\" character is a meter to gauge the vortex of desire and danger between the races. Again we see white male violence on the black female body and interracial desire ends in tragedy as she sobs over her mother's coffin.\n\n5. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967)\n\nReleased in the same year as the Loving vs. Virginia case, in which the Supreme Court overturned the ban on interracial marriage; Guess Who's Coming to Dinner uses the genre of romantic love and courtroom drama (set as debate between parents and lovers) rather than tragedy. It works against the history of Brute caricature by casting Sidney Poitier as Dr. John Prentice, a dignified black man who risks his white fiancés love for the sake of parental approval.\n\n6. Star Trek episode: \"Plato's Stepchildren\" (1967)\n\nAlthough Cpt. Kirk (William Shatner) and Lt. Uhura  (Nichelle Nichols) were forced to kiss by aliens, Nichols said studio executives were nervous. They had them do one scene where they kissed and one scene where they did not. In her memoir, she wrote, \"When the non-kissing scene came on, everyone in the room cracked up. The last shot, which looked okay on the set, actually had Bill wildly crossing his eyes. It was so corny and just plain bad it was unusable. The only alternative was to cut out the scene altogether, but that was impossible to do without ruining the entire episode. Finally, the guys in charge relented: \"To hell with it. Let's go with the kiss.\"\n\n7. Jungle Fever (1991)\n\nClass dynamics complicate this tragic romantic love story as Flipper (Wesley Snipes), an upper middle class black man has a passionate affair with his secretary, Angie (Annabella Sciorra), a working class Italian American. By inverting race with class and framing their love as adultery, Spike Lee upends audience expectations of interracial love as an easy-to-read moral fable. But he cannot envision a world where their love can survive. Inevitably the film becomes a tragedy as social violence from her family, friends and the police cause the pair to separate.\n\n8. Dreams from My Father by Barack Obama (1995)\n\nHardly anyone read Dreams from My Fathe r when it was first published. Today it has become a Rosetta Stone to the first African-American president. Often overlooked is the nuanced portrait of interracial love, and the children who inherit the contradictions left in its wake.\n\n9. Monster's Ball (2001)\n\nThis film of interracial desire repeats the tragic dramatic conventions of earlier decades. Leticia (Halle Berry), a working poor black woman, becomes the concubine of the white working class corrections officer Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton). Again, violence is focused on her psyche if not her body. The Jezebel caricature is invoked in the raw and rough sex scene where Leticia's body is visually cannibalized. The film is more of a survivor's story than a vision of love.\n\n10. Something New (2006)\n\nUpper middle class black woman Kenya McQueen (Sanaa Lathan) falls in love with a working class white gardener Brian Kelly (Simon Baker). Like Jungle Fever , director Sanaa Hamrii uses class dynamics to distance the characters from the violence and power imbalance of white male and black female interracial desire of older narratives. Happily, the film does not follow the tragic genre in killing the characters or destroying their love. Instead, it ends with them getting married.\n\n11. Awkward Black Girl (2012)\n\nThe latest progressive portrayal of interracial love, T he Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl has J (Issae Rae) as the black female protagonist being wooed by two men. One is Fred, a husky, sincere black man from work who adores her but is boringly normal. The other is \"white\" Jay, an awkward white man who mirrors J's deeply neurotic personality. Awkward Black Girl is the first glimpse of \"post-racial\" America. Race is not a moral crisis or a danger or source of tension. It is a source of humor, like when she jokes, \"Oh yeah, we're going to have mullato babies.\" It is telling that the characters are of the same middle class, hipster urban set. It is more telling that the show runs on YouTube, a place where artists are freed from the dead weight of old storytelling. And in that new freedom, people can create art that doesn't challenge or apologize for reality but simply reflects it."

      "text": "The Republicans want judges to define 'Black'\n\nAmerica has a long history of trying to define race.\n\nVery badly.\n\nThere has never been a consistent definition applied universally and non-arbitrarily. That's not surprising. Race makes no sense.\n\nThe concept developed post-hoc as justification for othering and oppression in the service of hierarchical desires and economic need.\n\nThe Republicans and their allies hope to take the country back to the time of asking judges to define race. That hope lies in the Supreme Court case concerning gerrymandering, Ardoin v. Robinson .\n\nWhile we know race is a social construct and nonsensical, we can't ignore race and the legacy of racial distinctions without reproducing the faux neutrality central to white supremacy. Pretending the laws that don't mention race are neutral usually results in privileging the white cishet men who have historically made the same law.\n\nSince the end of Jim Crow segregation, conservatives have had to enforce racism through \"facially neutral\" legislation (that is, laws that don't mention race). They have had to rely on the discriminatory outcomes of neutral law that's still racially targeted, such as voter ID requirements or mandatory minimum sentencing, all under the guise of \"colorblindness\" and the promise that the law does not see race.\n\nThe response from those concerned with actually addressing racism in law has been to argue for \"race-conscious\" laws that might explicitly acknowledge race but only in order to address racial harm.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act was a gold standard for race-conscious law in that it required the consideration of race when examining the impact of congressional district maps or voting restrictions.\n\nThat it worked meant it has also been repeatedly targeted by the Republicans. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down two key sections of the VRA in Shelby v. Holder . Now, the Republicans are trying to weaken section 2 of the VRA. That section prohibits any voting procedures that discriminate based on race.\n\nSection 2 is used for lawsuits claiming \"vote dilution,\" which typically concerns redistricting maps. The VRA requires congressional maps be drawn in such a way as to not \"dilute\" Black voting power.\n\nIn defending a Louisiana congressional district map in Ardoin v. Robinson , the Republicans are trying to restrict the definition of \"Black,\" which could definitely serve to dilute Black voting power.\n\nRather than counting everyone who checks the \"Black\" box as Black (the current definition), the Republicans want to limit those counted as Black as only including people who only check the \"Black\" box - excluding anyone who checked multiple ethnic or racial boxes.\n\nRacial definitions have always been imposed on racialized populations. Courts defining who counts as \"white\" or \"Black\" is not only arbitrary and nonsensical but an enactment of white supremacy.\n\nThe only way to address racial harm without reproducing white supremacist racism is by relying on the self-identification of those within the racialized groups. The court redefining Blackness is trying to subordinate Black people and define their group identity for them. Blackness must be defined by Black people.\n\nWhile, technically, this restrictive definition would still rely on self-identification, it would limit the definition of \"Black\" to not include anyone who might be Black and something else.\n\nIt would limit inter-group solidarity and likely serve old racist goals. Reducing Blackness to some kind of Black purity of one race forces racial conversations back to rigid binaries and made-up race science.\n\nRace is an arbitrary social construct, not a rigid binary. Mixed-race people have always threatened white supremacy because they challenge the race-science claims that race is essentialist and rigid.\n\nThey also invoke absurd concerns for white people that they could be around a Black person without really \"knowing\" it.\n\nIn miscegenation cases, a white spouse could accuse his spouse of fraud if it was determined the spouse was mixed race and \"passed\" to marry a white person (this could also be used in states without miscegenation statutes to get out of an interracial marriage).\n\nSuch claims support Cheryl Harris ' argument that whiteness is a type of property in white supremacist society. Whiteness as property only works in opposition to Blackness and is strengthened by restrictive definitions of Blackness imposed on Black people by white people.\n\nDuring slavery and Jim Crow segregation, mixed-race people were automatically included in Blackness, because it served economic goals and protected white purity from \"pollution.\" Interrogation into sufficient blood quantum for racial distinction will always serve white supremacy and reinforce race as scientific essentialism.\n\nLower courts have found the more restrictive definition wouldn't change the Louisiana map, but adopting a more restrictive definition for Section 2 claims could have far-reaching consequences.\n\nIf mixed-race people aren't counted as \"Black\" for the purposes of voter discrimination, or dilution claims, what are they counted as?\n\nIf they are counted as white, they cannot make voter discrimination or dilution claims at all despite the likelihood that they are still experiencing such discrimination. It's unlikely such a definition would be restricted to redistricting maps.\n\nWith conservative justices questioning due process claims under the 14th Amendment, it's possible even Loving v. Virginia is in danger.\n\nBefore interracial marriage was legalized, anti-miscegenation statutes could be read as restricting marriage for all-mixed race people. This argument was used by those challenging the statutes.\n\nWhile it wasn't successful, the claim was thrown out because the court was not presented with a mixed-race person trying to marry another - not because judges found the claim ridiculous.\n\nIn 1982, Congress amended Section 2 to include any law that has a discriminatory impact on voting to be unlawful in response to Mobile v. Bolden . In Mobile , the Supreme Court ruled that for laws to be in violation of the Voting Rights Act the legislators must have had the intent to be discriminatory if the law was racially neutral.\n\nA more restrictive definition of \"Black\" would make the discriminatory impact of a law smaller. Therefore excluding mixed-race people from Blackness could make discrimination claims from those included in Blackness more difficult to prove.\n\nThis critical race theory (yes, I said it) analysis is necessary to understand the danger that we face if the Republicans take us back to a time when the court imposed rigid race binaries and enforced definitions of race on marginalized groups.\n\nWe must defend voter power every chance we get."

      "text": "GOP Candidate Once Backed Claim that Interracial Marriage 'Will Destroy the White Race' - But Offered a Pass for Mitch McConnell\n\nOn Thursday, Media Matters For America reported that Everett Corley, the GOP nominee for Kentucky's 43rd State House District, has been involved in white nationalist circles.\n\nIn 2014, Corley - who that year ran unsuccessfully for the same district - appeared on The Ethno State , a broadcast of the white supremacist American Freedom Party. During that broadcast, he complained to the host, white supremacist activist William Johnson , that \"if you're a minority you can belong to all these groups that champion your ethno-background but you certainly [have] very little to do as a European or a Caucasian American.\"\n\nBut one of the most bizarre points of discussion was Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell's interracial marriage to Elaine Chao, who currently heads the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nIn response to Johnson's claim that McConnell's marriage means he \"is taking a stand that will destroy the white race,\" Corley replied that while he agreed \"we should maintain our people and our culture,\" his marriage \"is not my problem\" because it is a \"marriage that has not born any children or anything. That's simply a marriage of companionship.\"\n\nMitch McConnell is one of the most widely detested politicians in America, but his marriage to a Chinese-American woman is hardly a good reason for that. Bizarrely, though, McConnell's marriage has increasingly cropped up as a point of attack in GOP politics - most notably in the failed West Virginia Senate campaign of former coal mining baron and convicted criminal Don Blankenship, who blasted McConnell's father-in-law as a \" wealthy Chinaperson .\"\n\nThe American Freedom Party , founded as American Third Position, is a minor political party created by skinheads in Southern California. Its leaders, including Johnson, advocate designating the United States as a white country under law, abolishing the citizenship of all nonwhite people, and ultimately deporting them from the country. The group actually nominated a ticket for president in 2016 featuring anti-\"White Genocide\" activist Bob Whitaker , but later abandoned it to support the candidacy of Donald Trump.\n\nThe Republican Party of Kentucky lists Corley prominently among the list of candidates running for office in the state. Additionally, in his previous run for office, he was supported by Papa John's founder John Schnatter, who recently resigned in disgrace amid his own racism scandal.\n\nAnd Corley is not an aberration. The number of overt white supremacists running for office as Republicans this year is alarming.\n\nTwo neo-Nazis have actually won Republican nominations for congressional seats - Arthur Jones in Illinois, and John Fitzgerald in California. Another House nominee in New Jersey, Seth Grossman, was abandoned by the GOP after he called diversity \"a bunch of crap\" and a series of his viciously racist Facebook posts were uncovered. And Virginia Republicans nominated Corey Stewart for Senate, despite his neo-Confederate activism and links to the white nationalists behind the Charlottesville demonstrations.\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nView Non-AMP Version"

      "text": "With Roe overturned, Clarence Thomas is now preparing for a full-frontal assault on contraception, gay rights\n\nOn Friday, June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - overturning, in a 6-3 ruling, Roe v. Wade and, along with it, 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey , and paving the way for individual states to outlaw abortion.\n\nIn his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote, \"The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled. The authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.\"\n\nUnder the Dobbs ruling, millions of women in the United States will lose access to legal abortion. But the implications of Dobbs go way beyond abortion rights, and Justice Clarence Thomas himself is saying so. Thomas, one of the six justices who voted to overturn Roe , is now saying that the U.S. Supreme Court should reevaluate right-to-privacy decision s protecting gay rights and access to contraception .\n\nWho would you vote for in 2024, Biden or DeSantis? Vote now.\n\nThomas wrote, \"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold , Lawrence , and Obergefell.\"\n\nGriswold v. Connecticut , handed down by the Warren Court in 1965, struck down as unconstitutional a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of contraception by married couples. Just as Roe offered nationwide protection for abortion rights eight years later, Griswold established access to contraception as a nationwide right for married couples. And that right was extended to unmarried couples with Burger Court's 1972 ruling in Eisenstadt v. Baird.\n\nThe Lawrence that Thomas is referring to is Lawrence v. Texas , a 2003 ruling that struck down a Texas sodomy law as unconstitutional and, by extension, invalidated similar laws in other states. Lawrence , like Roe and Griswold , was very much a right-to-private decision. Although Lawrence was a major victory for gay rights, it has protected the sexual liberties of heterosexuals as well - for example, heterosexuals who engage in anal sex - and gay men are not the only Americans who have a lot to lose if Lawrence is someday overturned.\n\nThe Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, handed down in 2015, struck down prohibitions on same-sex marriage. And if Obergefell were overturned, same-sex marriages in many parts of the U.S. would no doubt be invalidated by Republican-controlled state legislatures.\n\nThere are many other right-to-privacy decisions - some not discussed nearly as much as Obergefell or Griswold - that could end up on the High Court's chopping block now that Roe has been overturned. One of them is Stanley v. Georgia .\n\nHanded down by the Warren Court in 1969, Stanley guarantees one's right to possess sexually explicit adult erotica even if that material is found to be obscene by a jury. The key word is \"adult\"; possession of child pornography is flat-out illegal under any circumstances. But the Stanley decision made it clear that where porn involving participants who are legal adults is concerned, obscenity has to do with creation or distribution - not simple possession. Under Stanley , no one can be prosecuted for obscenity in the United States for merely possessing adult porn.\n\nBut if Stanley were overturned, that right would go away. Obscenity was defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 1973 ruling Miller v. California , which tweaked an earlier definition of obscenity established with the 1957 ruling Roth v. the United States .\n\nAnother right that may be on the chopping block now that Roe has been overturned is the right to interracial marriage, which became a nationwide right in 1967 with the High Court's ruling in Loving v. Virginia . That Warren Court decision struck down Virginia's ban on interracial marriage and, by extension, similar bans in other states. Loving was also a right-to-privacy decision, saying that individual states had no right to prohibit interracial couples from getting married - and that decision helped pave the way for the Obergefell ruling 48 years later.\n\nBy overturning the 49-year-old Roe v. Wade ruling with its Dobbs decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has paved the way for Christian nationalists to attack a variety of other civil liberties as well - from contraception to same-sex marriage to interracial marriage. Abortion, as Justice Clarence Thomas himself has acknowledged, is only the tip of the iceberg."

      "text": "How the Supreme Court could make same-sex marriage into second-class marriage\n\nOn Friday, the Texas Supreme Court decided to take up the case of a Texas justice of the peace who was sanctioned because she refused to marry same-sex couples based on her religious beliefs-and she's planning to take her case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWait, you must be asking yourself, Haven't we been here before?\n\nYep.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nKim Davis, you'll remember, is the infamous Rowan County, Kentucky, clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples back in 2015 based on her religious beliefs after the Supreme Court handed down the Obergefell marriage equality decision that year. Davis was sued and ordered by a federal judge to begin issuing licenses. She appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which turned away her appeal.\n\nDavis still wouldn't issue licenses and was eventually jailed for contempt of court. She was released after five days-only after she agreed that she wouldn't interfere with deputy clerks granting licenses even as she took her name off of them.\n\nLots of people thought that settled that. And perhaps it did.\n\nBut perhaps not.\n\nDonald Trump, of course, remade the Supreme Court, which took a radical shift to the right. And Justice Clarence Thomas may have foreshadowed what's to come regarding granting government officials the right to discriminate in the scathing statement he wrote when the high court denied Kim Davis' appeal in 2015, a statement that was joined by Justice Samuel Alito:\n\nAs a result of this Court's alteration of the Constitution, Davis found herself with a choice between her religious beliefs and her job... ..Davis may have been one of the first victims in this Court's cavalier treatment of religion in its Obergefell decision, but she won't be the last. ..By choosing to privilege a novel constitutional right over the religious liberty interests explicitly protected in the First Amendment, and by doing so undemocratically, the Court has created a problem only it can fix.\n\nSo it was clear in 2015 where these two would take things if they got the chance-that is, if fellow extremists joined them on the court down the road-even though their argument was absurd and hypocritical. Government employees' religious beliefs haven't entitled them to discriminate against groups of people. In the case of clerks issuing marriage licenses, surely they couldn't use religion to turn away an interracial marriage or a Jewish couple, even if it they believed it went against the tenets of their particular faith.\n\nShare The Signorile Report\n\nFast forward to 2023, and that is not so clear anymore. The current Supreme Court-with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and Brett Kavanaugh, put on the court by Trump-has ruled in favor of blatant discrimination, all in the name of religious freedom. And Thomas and Alito may now have the chance to \"fix\" yet another \"problem\" they claim the court created.\n\nThe Waco, Texas, justice of the peace at the center of the current case, Dianne Hensley, refused to perform same-sex marriages in 2019 based on her religious beliefs as a Christian. She was f ormally sanctioned by the Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct. She filed a lawsuit, arguing her rights were violated under the Texas Religious Restoration Freedom Act. The case was dismissed by a state district judge, and that decision was upheld upon appeal. Hensley then appealed to the very right-wing Texas Supreme Court, and it decided on Friday to take her case.\n\nHensley's lawyers at the First Liberty Institute , a Christian nationalist law firm with ties to corrupt, viciously anti-LGBTQ Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, are using the U.S. Supreme Court's 6-3 decision last June in 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, in which the court's conservatives ruled that a Colorado web designer can't be forced to serve same-sex couples seeking wedding websites based on her religious beliefs-even though no same-sex couple had actually sought the web designer's services. Per the Texas Tribune :\n\nJustin Butterfield, an attorney for Hensley at First Liberty Institute, has maintained throughout the lawsuit that religious liberty is Hensley's right as a citizen. \"303 Creative affirmed that religious liberty is not a second-class right in America,\" Butterfield wrote in an email to The Texas Tribune. \"We look forward to vindicating Judge Hensley's rights in the Texas Supreme Court.\"\n\nDale Carpenter, chair of constitutional law at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law, told the Tribune he believes this is one of a \"slew\" of cases that will try to expand the reach of 303 Creative. He seems skeptical that that will happen, telling the Tribune that the Colorado case has little to do with Hensley's case because the 303 Creative decision applies to private businesses, while Hensley is a government official.\n\nBut will that matter to the Christian nationalist-friendly Texas Supreme Court and ultimately the current U.S. Supreme Court?\n\nWe've seen this Supreme Court spin out whatever it wants on a whole variety of issues, from affirmative action and abortion rights to student loan debt and immigration. This court's motto is: Where there's a will, there's a way.\n\nAnd we know there's a will because Thomas told us there is-with Alito joining him-in the statement he issued in 2015 regarding Kim Davis.\n\n\"If Judge Hensley were to actually win this case, it would basically gut a good portion of marriage equality that we got,\" Ash Hall, an ACLU of Texas policy and advocacy strategist, told the Tribune. \"Your ability to get married then would be dependent on your ZIP code and kind of what resources were around you.\"\n\nHall said the ACLU isn't surprised by Hensley using the 303 Creative case either, and has expected such lawsuits would be coming down the pike. No one can predict what the Supreme Court will do. So we shouldn't be shocked if the court expands its abominable decision in 303 Creative to allow even government employees to treat gay and lesbian couples as second-class citizens."

      "text": "'Fight this wicked ideology': Evangelical fundamentalist declares war on white Christian nationalism\n\nThe Religious Right has had a stranglehold on the GOP since the early 1980s, when conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona) warned that members of his party were making a huge mistake by embracing far-right evangelical Christian fundamentalists. More than 40 years later, the GOP/Religious Right alliance is as strong as ever. And the term \"Christian nationalism\" is being used to describe MAGA-minded white evangelicals who are extreme even by Religious Right standards.\n\nIn an article published by Religion News on August 23, reporter Bob Smietana takes a look at the activities of Owen Strachan - a right-wing evangelical Southern Baptist seminary professor who is now calling out some of the overt racism he is seeing among Christian nationalists.\n\nStrachan, according to Smietana, has described Christian nationalism as \"the unbiblical view that we must preserve white ethnicity to build a Christian nation.\" And the extremists he is calling out include Gab founder Andrew Torba and author Matt Walsh (a self-described \"theocratic fascist\" ).\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nOn August 18 on X, formerly Twitter, Strachan declared , \"By the minute, we are smoking out white nationalism - godless ethnocentrism - in Christian circles. By grace, we will fight this wicked ideology.\"\n\nSmietana explains , \"(Strachan) felt the need to call out the trend earlier this month after a video appeared of Walsh saying that white Americans needed to have more children to save the country from outsiders. Strachan had already seen comments from Torba on social media, since deleted, saying that God created different ethnic groups with a purpose and that preserving them 'is to preserve God's creation and is therefore an inherent good.'\"\n\nSmietana notes that Christian nationalism has become \"a hot topic.\"\n\n\"In its extreme form,\" the reporter warns , \"the ideology claims special privileges for Christians - including the right to rule, no matter what the outcome of elections - and often views Jews, Black Americans, immigrants and progressives as God's enemies. Early forms of Christian nationalism were outspokenly antisemitic and racist and were especially opposed to interracial marriage.\"\n\nBob Smietana's full report for Religion News is available at this link ."

      "text": "The consequences of reactionaries conducting judicial review\n\nIn and of itself, the power of judicial review is neither good nor bad. Like any other power, it can be wielded to advance or thwart democratic values and the ideals of equal justice. Over the decades, the court has done just that, handing down both deplorable and venerable rulings, some extremely right-wing and some liberal and progressive.\n\nIn the most despicable decision in its entire history, Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), the court held that African Americans, no matter where they resided or whether they were then free or enslaved, could not be American citizens. The decision specifically invalidated the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had prohibited slavery in the Louisiana territory north of the 36°30′ latitude line.\n\nIn the words of Chief Justice Roger Taney, who wrote the majority opinion and was himself a former slave owner, Black Americans \"had no rights that the white man was bound to respect.\" The Dred Scott decision plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and helped trigger the Civil War.\n\nWith the end of Reconstruction, the Supreme Court again moved sharply to the right in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883, a set of five consolidated decisions that struck down portions of the Civil Rights Act of 1875. The 1875 act prohibited racial discrimination in transportation facilities, hotels, theatres and other places of \"public amusement.\" By a vote of 8-1, the court held that the federal government had no power to outlaw discrimination in the private sector. (Discrimination in employment and places of public accommodation would not be outlawed until passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968.)\n\nOver the decades, the court has done just that, handing down both deplorable and venerable rulings, some extremely right-wing and some liberal and progressive.\n\nThe court struck another crippling blow against racial equality in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), upholding the constitutionality of a Louisiana law that required separate railroad cars for white and black people. The ruling constitutionalized the doctrine of \"separate but equal,\" and legitimized segregation and white-supremacy institutions and practices that would persist in the South into the 1950s in what historians call the \"Jim Crow\" era.\n\nDuring the late 19th century and into the 20th, the court exercised the power of judicial review to come to the aid of big business, trusts and monopolies, ruling that the federal government had the authority to break up labor strikes , declaring laws setting limits on maximum working hours unconstitutional, and invalidating child-labor and minimum-wage laws.\n\nContinuing its bias in favor of corporations over labor, the court invalidated several key legislative pieces of the early New Deal , stymying the Roosevelt administration's efforts to fight the Great Depression. It was not until President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced a plan to expand the court to include as many as 15 justices that the high tribunal turned around. Although legislation to implement the plan never passed, the court subsequently upheld the National Labor Relations and Social Security Acts and other progressive pillars of FDR's economic recovery package.\n\nFinally, a great sea change in the use of judicial review took place during the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren , who led the court from 1953 until his retirement in 1969. In one of the most enlightened and progressive decisions in its history, Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the court unanimously held that state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional. The decision put a formal end to the post-Civil War segregation doctrine of \"separate but equal\" and explicitly overturned Plessy v. Ferguson .\n\nUnder Warren's stewardship, the court issued a host of other landmark liberal decisions, upholding the Voting Rights Act , establishing First Amendment protections for newspapers, reporters and publishers against defamation lawsuits brought by public officials and public figures, establishing the reapportionment principle of \"one person one vote,\" invalidating state laws that banned interracial marriage , guaranteeing the right to counsel in criminal cases , and much more.\n\nUnfortunately, in recent decades, the court has shifted steadily back to the right. The move to the right has been especially acute since the appointment of Chief Justice John Roberts in 2005.\n\nWith Roberts at the helm, the court has, among other things, reinterpreted the Second Amendment to include an individual right to bear arms, undermined the legal foundations of union organizing , removed political gerrymandering from the jurisdiction of federal courts, and opened election campaigns to unlimited spending by corporations, unions and wealthy individual donors.\n\nThe Roberts court has been particularly aggressive in rolling back voting rights. In 2013, in a 5-4 majority opinion penned by Roberts himself in the case of Shelby County v. Holder , the court gutted the \"preclearance provisions\" of the Voting Rights Act. Those provisions, now moribund, required advance federal approval of changes in election procedures in jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination.\n\nThe Roberts court has been particularly aggressive in rolling back voting rights.\n\nShelby County was a stark reminder of the dark side of judicial review, coming only seven years after Congress had reauthorized the Voting Rights Act by a 98-0 vote in the Senate and a 390-33 margin in the House of Representatives.\n\nTo be fair, the record of the Roberts Court has included some liberal rulings, especially in the field of gay rights and same-sex marriage.\n\nHowever, with conservatives now holding a solid 6-3 majority on the court and utilizing the awesome power of judicial review, the future looks decidedly bleak. Indeed, in its October 2021 term, the court returned to its reactionary roots, overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey and revoking the federal constitutional right to abortion with its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization . The court also created grave new obstacles to gun control with its opinion in New York Rifle & Pistol Ass'n. v. Bruen . The October 2022 term promises to deliver more of the same."

      "text": "Interracial Marriage and the Law\n\nIn the past decade, the law and the Supreme Court have done a great deal to ensure the equality of all races and to guarantee equal civil rights. But in the area of interracial marriage, the statutes of nineteen states continue to deny the individual the freedom to marry the person of his choice. The vagaries of these statutes and the failure of the Supreme Court to act are here set forth by William D. Zabel , a practicing lawyer in New York.\n\nWHEN a reporter asked former President Harry S. Truman if interracial marriage - miscegenation - would become widespread in the United States, Mr. Truman said, \"I hope not; I don't believe in it.\" Then Mr. Truman asked the reporter that hackneyed question often spouted at anyone advocating racial integration, \"Would you want your daughter to marry a Negro?\" The reporter responded that he wanted his daughter to marry the man she loved whoever he might be. \"Well, she won't love someone who isn't her color,\" the former President continued, and, as if he had not said enough, added that racial intermarriage ran counter to the teachings of the Bible.\n\nThe question of miscegenation can make a man like Truman, whose past support of integration in other respects is not open to question, appear unthinking if not bigoted. The fact of interracial marriage can cause a young Radcliffe-educated \"liberal\" to refuse to attend the wedding of her only brother, or a civilized, intelligent judge to disown and never again speak to his daughter. How many persons are repelled or at least disconcerted at the mere sight of a Negro-white couple? Perhaps their number tells us how far we are from achieving an integrated society.\n\nIf usually tolerant and rational persons can react this way, it is not surprising that many experts consider the fear of miscegenation the strongest reason for the desire of whites to keep the Negro permanently segregated. Next in importance in the \"white man's rank order of discrimination,\" according to Gunnar Myrdal in his classic study, An American Dilemma , are other social conventions, the use of public facilities, political franchise, legal equality, and employment. On the other hand, the social and legal barriers to miscegenation rank at the bottom of the Negro's list of grievances; quite naturally, he is more concerned with obtaining a job, decent living accommodations, and an education than with marrying \"your daughter.\" A recent Ford Foundation study of more than seven hundred Negro families in Chicago concluded: \"There is no evidence of a desire for miscegenation, or even interest in promoting it, except among a tiny minority.\"\n\nEven though the Negro has finally attained equality under the law in most areas of American life, a Negro and a white still cannot marry in nineteen states having antimiscegenation statutes - mostly Southern and \"border\" states, but also including Indiana and Wyoming. No other civilized country has such laws except the Union of South Africa.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has never ruled on the constitutionality of these statutes. In 1954, a few months after its historic decision prohibiting segregation in public schools, the Court refused to review the case of Linnie Jackson, a Negro woman who had been convicted under the Alabama miscegenation statute. Later, in 1956, the Court again avoided the issue, dismissing an appeal in a miscegenation case from Virginia. This dismissal was termed \"wholly without basis in law\" by a leading authority on constitutional law, Professor Herbert Wechsler of the Columbia Law School, because there was no appropriate legal reason for avoiding the decision.\n\nIn December, 1964, the Court upset the conviction of Connie Hoffman, a white woman, and Dewey McLaughlin, a Spanish-speaking merchant seaman from British Honduras. They had violated a Florida criminal law punishing extramarital cohabitation only if the offending couple were a Negro and a white person. The Court invalidated this statute as a denial of equal protection of the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment but refused to express \"any views about [Florida's] prohibition of interracial marriage.\"\n\nThe Court may again be confronted with this question in a case instituted by a white construction worker and his part-Negro wife, Richard and Mildred Loving. They are seeking to have the Virginia miscegenation law declared unconstitutional so that they and their three children may reside in the state from which they have been banished. The Lovings have no connection with the civil rights movement and are not represented by attorneys of a Negro civil rights organization. Both had spent all their lives in Caroline County, Virginia, south of Fredericksburg. They were married in Washington, D.C., in 1958 and returned to Virginia. Five weeks later, they were charged with the crime of marrying each other, and because of this crime were convicted and sentenced to one year in prison. But Virginia County Circuit Judge Leon M. Bazlie suspended the sentences and provided instead that the Lovings leave Virginia \"at once and do not return together or at the same time\" for twenty-live years.\n\nShould the Supreme Court avoid deciding this question because Negroes as a group are not concerned with it and because a decision of unconstitutionality might harm the civil rights movement? Before concluding that such a decision ought to be avoided if possible, or alternatively, how the question ought to be decided, we should consider the history and content of the miscegenation laws.\n\nTHE use of laws to ban marriages between persons of different races developed primarily in this country as an outgrowth peculiar to our institution of slavery. Neither the common law of England nor its statutes provide precedents for America's miscegenation laws.\n\nA Maryland statute of 1661 is generally considered the first miscegenation law in America, even though it did not prohibit interracial marriage and was motivated not by a theory of racial superiority, but by economic considerations. Socioeconomic conditions in the colonial period encouraged racial mingling. There was a severe shortage of Negro women in the colonies, and to a lesser extent, of white men of the same social class as the white female indentured servants. These indentured servants and Negro slaves, who often worked together in the fields and lived near each other in similar tenant huts, intermixed and intermarried. By the general custom of the time, a child of such a marriage would be a freeman because lie acquired the status of his mother. \"And forasmuch as divers freeborn English women . . . do intermarry with negro slaves\" by which \"a great damage doth befall the master of such negroes,\" the Maryland statute was passed to stop such marriages by making the female miscegenator a slave for the lifetime of her husband and all children of such marriages \"slaves as their fathers were.\"\n\nAccording to some historians, after this law was passed, plantation owners encouraged or forced white women, usually indentured servants, to marry Negroes in order to increase the number of slaves. Lord Baltimore, shocked by this practice, had the law changed in 1681 to penalize any master encouraging an interracial marriage and to make such women and their issue free. Masters stopped encouraging these marriages, but they still occurred. And the children of the interracial couples were the financial burden of the masters during their minority because they were the legal children of male slaves. Such children were, however, freed upon reaching maturity. New laws became necessary to compel the servant girls to reimburse the masters for the cost of supporting these children. These laws did not achieve their purpose, and so, finally, all Negro-white marriages were prohibited.\n\nIn 1691, Virginia passed a law prohibiting miscegenation to prevent \"spurious issue.\" Any white person marrying a Negro was to be banished from Virginia forever. Considering the banishment of the Lovings in 1959, Virginia's policy has not changed much since 1691.\n\nEventually, miscegenation laws were passed in nearly all the colonies, including Massachusetts in 1705, which also was one of the first states to repeal its law, in 1843. During the nineteenth century, as many as thirty-eight states prohibited interracial marriages. In the period surrounding the Civil War, nine states repealed their statutes. But through the years, Southern states made their laws harsher, Georgia and Virginia going so far as to require all citizens to register and identify their \"race\" although never establishing a practical means for enforcing the requirement. By 1951, there remained in effect twenty-nine miscegenation statutes. Ten states since 1951 have repealed their statutes. Of these, most were Western states, such as South Dakota (1957), Colorado (1957), Nevada (1959), Nebraska (1963), and Utah (1963), acting at least partially in response to the Negro social revolution.\n\nAll nineteen states with miscegenation laws prohibit Negro-white marriages. Other \"races\" which have been included in the various laws are Mongolians, Chinese, Japanese, Africans, Malayans, American Indians, Asiatic Indians, West Indians, mulattoes, Ethiopians, Hindus, Koreans, mestizos, and half-breeds. The laws border on burlesque. The Arizona law, repealed in 1962, at one time so defined a mulatto that he could not marry anyone, even another mulatto; then it was changed so that a mulatto could marry an Indian but could not marry a Negro, a Caucasian, or another mulatto.\n\nWHO is a Negro under such laws? There is no uniform definition, so it is difficult to know. The different definitions create racial chameleons. One can be Negro in Georgia because he had a onehalf Negro great-grandmother, and by crossing the border into Florida, become a white because Florida makes him a Negro only if he had a full Negro great-grandmother. The most common definition uses an unscientific percentage-of-blood test usually classifying a Negro as \"any person of one-eighth or more Negro blood.\" If a blood test is to be used and one-eighth Negro blood, whatever that means, makes you Negro, why does not one-eighth white blood make you white? Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, and Virginia make anyone a Negro who has any ascertainable trace of Negro blood. The Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Wyoming laws provide no definition of a Negro, and Tennessee has two conflicting definitions. Oklahoma and Texas prohibit marriages between whites and Africans or descendants of Africans without defining an African.\n\nIt should not be surprising that in the usual case a jury may decide that a person is a Negro from his appearance - a test authorized by statute in Missouri. Neither the statutes nor science provides a method to determine whether a person is one eighth Negro or one of the other statutory formulas of fractionalized racial membership. Terms such as \"octaroons,\" \"quadroons,\" and \"half-breeds\" are misleading except in a fictional or social sense. Genes are not transmitted in predetermined or culturally labeled quantities as the draftsmen of these statutes thought. Detailed genealogies might be used to try to make the statutory racial calculus workable. But even where genealogies are available, they may be unreliable or insufficiently informative on the racial composition of the great-grandparent whose blood allegedly makes the accused a Negro. After all, from one third to three fourths of U.S. Negroes have some Caucasian ancestry.\n\nIn short, the statutory definitions of Negro are sometimes contradictory, often nonexistent, and usually a combination of legal fiction and genetic nonsense nearly impossible to apply as a practical matter. None of the statutory definitions seems sufficiently precise to meet the constitutional requirement of due process which nullifies a criminal statute that is so vague that men of common intelligence must guess at its meaning and differ about its application.\n\nAnd the penalties under these statutes can be quite severe - ten years imprisonment in Florida or North Carolina. Georgia, South Carolina, and other states impose criminal penalties upon anyone issuing a license to a miscegenetic couple or performing their marriage ceremony. Virginia levies a fine on anyone performing such a marriage ceremony \"of which the informer shall have one half.\" Because these laws make the proscribed marriages void, a spouse may be prevented from inheriting from his or her mate by other heirs who prove the forbidden interracial nature of the marriage; spouses have even lost the right to workmen's compensation benefits otherwise payable. In many states, children of such marriages are declared illegitimate and are thereby prevented from inheriting under intestacy laws.\n\nMississippi, not surpassed in its crusade to maintain segregation, has a unique law supplementing its ban on interracial marriage, making a crime the publication for \"general information, arguments or suggestions in favor of social equality or of intermarriage between whites and Negroes,\" and punishing the violator by imprisonment or fine or both. This law could be invoked against me for writing this article, or the Atlantic Monthly for printing it.\n\nThe rule voiding miscegenetic marriages creates another disturbing problem. A mixed couple legally marries in a state where their marriage is valid, and later, quite innocently, enters a state with a miscegenation statute. This couple would be subject to criminal prosecution for miscegenation, fornication, or cohabitation in the state which will not recognize the validity of their marriage even though it was valid where celebrated. Delaware, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas actually declare such marriages invalid by statute.\n\nIs it not alarming to know that in 1965 the new U.S. congresswoman from Hawaii, who is of Japanese descent, and her Caucasian husband could be criminally prosecuted under Virginia law if they were to reside there while Congress is in session? These laws are completely contrary to the undeniable trend in this country to ensure Negroes equality under the law. They continue to exist even though the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to eliminate racial discrimination fostered by state legislation. Yet, surprisingly, fifteen state supreme courts and several lower federal tribunals have upheld these laws. Only the Alabama Supreme Court in 1872 (which reversed itself in 1877) and the California Supreme Court in 1948 have declared miscegenation statutes unconstitutional.\n\nWHAT are the legal issues? How does a state justify making a marriage between two competent, consenting adults a crime solely because one is Negro and the other white?\n\nSome decisions without any reasoning sanction the statutes simply by referring to \"laws\" of nature or of God which interdict amalgamation of the races. In an early decision, the Missouri Supreme Court approved a miscegenation law because of the \"well authenticated fact\" that the issue of miscegenetic marriages \"cannot possibly have any progeny and such a fact sufficiently justifies those laws which forbid the intermarriage of blacks and whites. . . .\" This \"fact\" is pure fiction.\n\nOther courts have reasoned that these laws do not discriminate by race because whites and Negroes are treated equally in that both races are prevented from intermarrying. This so-called \"equal application\" theory is supported by reference to a now discredited 1883 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court affirming a conviction of a Negro man and white woman for fornication even though the penalty was more severe than for the commission of the same act by two whites or by two Negroes. But the decisive question is not whether different races, each considered as a group, are treated equally. Races do not marry, individuals do; and the Fourteenth Amendment protects the personal right of an individual to marry. When a Negro is denied the right, solely because he is a Negro, to marry a white woman who wishes to marry him, the law discriminates against him and denies him a fundamental right solely because of his race, just as it denies the same right to the white woman.\n\nDefenders of miscegenation laws maintain that the right to marry is subject to regulation by the state, and that the state has the power to ban miscegenetic marriages in order to prevent the violence and tension that will result from their legalization. Even if violence were certain to occur, this fact would not justify the statutes. No court should accept the reasoning that race tension can be eradicated by perpetuating by law the irrational prejudices that cause the tension. This reasoning not only is circular but also suggests that local law officials are unwilling or unable to maintain order - clearly not a rational basis to support a law depriving persons of constitutional rights. In fact, racial violence is almost nonexistent in areas where miscegenation is common, as in Brazil and Hawaii.\n\nVirginia's highest court, in sustaining a miscegenation statute in 1955, emphasized the state's legislative purpose \"to preserve the racial integrity of its citizens\" and to prevent the creation of \"a mongrel breed of citizens.\" Assuming racial purity to be a legitimate purpose, the only race kept \"pure\" is the Caucasian, because these laws do not prohibit, for example, Negroes from marrying Mongolians. If racial purity is a desirable goal, then why are only Caucasians protected, and why should a \"pure Negro\" be allowed to marry a person who is seven eighths Caucasian and only one eighth Negro? This occurs not from a lack of logic or from ignorance, but because these laws are designed to preserve the purity of the majority Caucasian race - which in itself is one aspect of their larger, unexpressed goal of preserving what many think of as our \"white American culture.\"\n\nOf course, the maintenance of racial purity is a meretricious basis for these laws. There is no evidence to support the existence of so-called \"pure\" races. Even the idea of a pure race has been termed a subterfuge to cloak ignorance of the phenomenon of racial variation. Race mixture has occurred extensively throughout history.\n\nOften courts have accepted, either explicitly or implicitly, two erroneous assumptions in order to find a rational basis for the laws: (1) the white race will be harmed by intermixing because of its innate superiority over the Negro race and (2) the progeny of Negro-white marriages are inferior.\n\nThere is no scientific evidence to sustain the assumption that the white race is innately superior to the Negro race. One can still find \"studies,\" such as those by Carleton Putnam in 1961 and W. C. George in 1962 (commissioned by the Alabama legislature), to support the theory of an inferior race. Most serious students of anthropology do not even consider this question a present problem for research, agreeing that the races of the world are essentially equal in native ability and capacity for civilization and that group differences are for the most part cultural and environmental, not hereditary.\n\nAs for the progeny of racial intermixing, there is not a single anthropologist teaching at a major university in the United States who subscribes to the theory that Negro-white matings cause biologically deleterious results. On the contrary, some conclude that because of a certain hybrid vigor, interracial marriage may be desirable and the offspring superior, citing the Hawaiian population, among others, to support this view.\n\nIn addition to their \"scientific\" arguments, defenders of the laws maintain that a state has an obligation to protect both the couples and their children from the psychological harm of social adjustments necessitated by miscegenation. Upholding the Louisiana miscegenation law in 1959, that state's supreme court stressed, without citing factual or other authority, that a state could prohibit miscegenetic marriages to protect the children of such marriages from \"a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.\" (The quoted language used by the Louisiana court, with, I think, a touch of sarcasm, was taken from the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision prohibiting segregation in public schools.)\n\nEven if one assumes there are findings of fact to support the legislature's judgment that miscegenation will cause social harm, must the U.S. Supreme Court bow to its judgment? The Court, consistent with its appropriate function in our political system, has developed a salutary presumption in favor of the constitutionality of state legislation. But if a law discriminates solely on the basis of race, then the Court considers the law constitutionally suspect and requires the state to justify the racial classification by some overriding legislative purpose.\n\nThere may yet be racial classifications which are constitutional, such as the use of different mortality tables for whites and Negroes or the keeping of racially segregated public records for statistical purposes. Nevertheless, the guarantee of equal protection of the laws must mean at the very least that there can be no valid legislative purpose for a state law which denies two competent, consenting adults the right to marry because of the color of their skins or the imagined racial composition of their blood. No legal scholar of note considers these laws constitutional nor thinks that a declaration of their unconstitutionality will require a new interpretation of the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nTODAY interracial marriage is opposed because of social considerations by the majority of both Negroes and whites. Even those who approve in principle would find it difficult to advise their sons or daughters to enter into such a marriage knowing the unavoidable social problems which confront an interracial couple.\n\nHowever, the number of interracial marriages does seem to be increasing. Andrew D. Weinberger, a New York lawyer who has studied miscegenation, estimates that there are one million such couples in the country, including a large number of light-skinned Negroes who pass for white and whose marriages - estimated at 810,000 - are not generally known as mixed marriages. He estimates known mixed marriages at 190,000. Neither their number nor the personal reasons for these interracial marriages may be significant. It may be significant that many leading Negroes in public life are partners in mixed marriages, including Edward W. Brooke, Republican Attorney General of Massachusetts, the highest Negro public officeholder in the United States, and James Farmer, national director of CORE. More mixed marriages will occur as integrated education spreads, and generally, these laws will be no obstacle. For example, after the disclosure of the marriage of Charlayne Hunter, the first Negro girl to enter and graduate from the University of Georgia, to a white Southerner and fellow student, they left Georgia and now reside in New York City.\n\nAlthough an argument can be made that the Supreme Court would make a serious error if it now struck down these laws, it misstates the question to ask whether a decision should be deferred because the issue is incendiary to some whites and insignificant to most Negroes. In their apparent lack of concern about the existence of these laws, Negro spokesmen may underestimate both their symbolic meaning and their psychological force in the states which have such laws. Consider the efforts in Alabama to remove Garth Williams' book for children, The Rabbits' Wedding , from the shelves of the public libraries because the picture of the two little rabbits who \"were wed and lived together happily in the big forest; eating dandelions\" indicated that one was white and the other black. White racists point to these laws to support their appeal to the ultimate superstition fostering racial prejudice - the myth that Negroes are innately inferior to whites - and to demonstrate that even the Supreme Court (by its silence) still deems the Negro inferior in his right to enter into the most private and personal of relationships. There are no laws more symbolic of the Negro's relegation to second-class citizenship. The fact that legislation cannot end prejudice does not mean that laws which foster it should continue to exist.\n\nThe elaborate legal structure of segregation has virtually collapsed with the exception of the miscegenation laws. Whether or not the Supreme Court was wise to avoid this question in 1954, it should now invalidate these laws. A free society cannot tolerate legalized racial prejudice, unsupported by reason or morals and capable of causing incalculable hurt to those designated inferior by law."

      "text": "Was Loving v. Virginia Really About Love?\n\nFifty years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down state laws banning interracial marriage, but the issues involved in the case extended beyond its current popular understanding as a tribute to romance.\n\nInterracial marriage is at a historic high. According to a recent Pew Research Center report , couples with different racial backgrounds made up one in six new marriages in 2015-a stark change from previous eras when even looking at someone across the color line with a hint of romance could be a matter of life or death. This radical shift is largely attributed to the Supreme Court's decision in Loving v. Virginia , which marks its 50th anniversary on June 12. In Loving , the Court struck down state laws banning interracial marriage, holding that such restrictions are unconstitutional.\n\nLoving is widely praised as a case about law ceding to the power of love in the face of astonishing harassment and bigotry endured by interracial couples. The redemptive trope coming out of the Loving decision that love conquers all has also influenced other social movements, such as those leading to Obergefell v. Hodges -the 2015 Supreme Court decision recognizing same-sex marriage.\n\nThe 1967 Loving decision therefore is often celebrated as an affirmation of love that made America a better and more progressive society. There's just one problem.\n\nLove is not what the case was really about.\n\nAt issue in the Loving decision was Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which prohibited interracial marriage and paved the way for a series of state laws designed to prevent racial mixing. Anti-miscegenation laws had been common in Virginia for centuries. But what often becomes lost in discussions about Loving is that this particular act was signed into law on the very same day the Virginia legislature passed another act that allowed the state to forcibly sterilize people with disabilities, including people labeled with derogatory medical terms such as \"feebleminded.\" Questions concerning the lawfulness of Virginia's forced sterilization law led to another landmark Supreme Court decision in 1927, Buck v. Bell , in which the Court upheld its legality with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes infamously declaring \"three generations of imbeciles are enough.\"\n\nVirginia's dual passage of racial integrity and sterilization acts in 1924 highlighted another concern held by lawmakers beyond that of interracial love: the perception that the white race was in danger of being weakened by inferior traits and that laws were needed to promote good racial hygiene and public health.\n\nAs legal historian Paul Lombardo notes , these acts showed how marriage restrictions and forced sterilization were deeply connected strategies for promoting a broader agenda of eugenics-a popular social and political standpoint in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that used science, law, and medicine to weed out groups with what were taken to be hereditary defects (disability, poverty, criminality, etc.). Eugenics had been practiced in many nations across the globe and took various forms, including immigration restrictions, incarceration, and the genocides seen during the Holocaust. Supporters worked to encourage the demographic growth of so-called superior people of a predictable class, race, and ethnicity.\n\nEugenics was a failed political attempt at giving intellectual and scientific cover to what was nothing more than the gross racism and stigmatization of disadvantaged groups. The Supreme Court, in Loving , euphemistically referred to the time when these laws were passed as a \"period of extreme nativism which followed the end of the First World War.\" Tied closely to this nativism was the eugenic rearticulation of old entrenched biases that were not only skeptical of foreigners, but deeply invested in controlling reproduction as a means of preserving power for a particular slice of White America.\n\nWithin this context, it becomes clear that the issues involved in Loving extended beyond its current popular understanding as a tribute to romance. Indeed, for a case heralded for being about the boundless nature of love, there is surprisingly little discussion about this in the Loving decision apart from the appellants' surname and rather dry assertions that marriage is a civil right. By contrast, consider this passage from the Court's opinion in Obergefell , which reflects Justice Anthony Kennedy's tone throughout a decision that waxes poetically on love's virtues:\n\nMarriage responds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there. It offers the hope of companionship and understanding and assurance that while both still live there will be someone to care for the other.\n\nThe Loving decision instead responded to the eugenic aspect of Virginia's Racial Integrity Act and how it was designed to prevent the perceived dilution of white racial purity. Rather than celebrating love, the Court's opinion states that laws against interracial marriage are unconstitutional because they are \"measures designed to maintain White Supremacy.\"\n\nUnderstanding Loving v. Virginia from this perspective highlights exactly why it is important, 50 years later, to recognize the Court's decision in ways that go beyond affirming that love knows no racial boundaries. Loving v. Virginia continues to be relevant to modern discussions on racial intimacy, and speaks to contemporary social and political initiatives whose true purpose is often masked by distracting and disingenuous rhetoric. This can be seen in current government proposals aimed at banning travel from certain Muslim-majority countries, building a physical barrier on the southern border, revoking health care from millions of people, and decimating civil rights programs and social services that provide support for the most vulnerable. A robust understanding of Loving instructs us to peel back the superficial economic and political justifications for these contemporary proposals. This allows us to appreciate how they are often motivated by an eerily reminiscent Holmesian logic regarding who is weak and who is strong, who belongs and who doesn't, and who deserves to live and who should perish.\n\nAt its half-century mark, Loving v. Virginia should be celebrated for fostering multi-racial relationships that have brought joy to many families and made communities stronger. Yet, it's also important to understand and appreciate its relevance to not only intimate relationships, but also relationships between government and those who are governed. Loving is a decision that implores us to reject the eugenic and supremacist remnants of a distant past and to pursue a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive society. That, in a nutshell, is what love is truly about."

      "text": "What Interracial and Gay Couples Know About 'Passing'\n\nThe misery of masquerading\n\nAs I awaited news of the U.S. Supreme Court's decisions in the same-sex marriage cases last month, I began to reflect on all of the daily privileges that I receive as a result of being heterosexual -- freedoms and privileges that my husband and I might not have enjoyed even fifty years ago. For our marriage is interracial.\n\nGiven my own relationship, I often contest anti-gay marriage arguments by noting the striking similarities between arguments that were once also widely made against interracial marriage. \"They're unnatural.\" \"It's about tradition.\" And my personal favorite, \"what about the children?\" In response, opponents of same-sex marriage, particularly other blacks, have often told me that the struggles of gays and lesbians are nothing at all like those African Americans (and other minorities) have faced, specifically because gays and lesbians can \"pass\" as straight and blacks cannot \"pass\" as white -- as if that somehow renders the denial of marital rights in one case excusable and another inexcusable. In both cases, denying the right to marriage still works to mark those precluded from the institution as \"other,\" as the supposed inferior.\n\nBut what does it mean to \"pass\"? And what effect does passing have, in the longer term, on a relationship and on a person's psyche?\n\nUntil a recent trip with my husband to South Africa, my understanding of the harms caused by passing came primarily through my research on interracial family law, and in particular through the tragic love story of Alice Beatrice Rhinelander and Leonard Kip Rhinelander, to which I devoted the first half of my recent book.\n\nAlice Beatrice (Jones) Rhinelander was a working-class chambermaid who in the fall of 1921 met and fell in love with Leonard Kip Rhinelander, a wealthy white man who descended from the French Huguenots and was an heir to millions of dollars. After three years of dating, Alice and Leonard got married on October 14, 1924. However, unlike most weddings involving a member of New York high society, there was no wedding announcement about or celebration for this Rhinelander union. Instead, Alice and Leonard went to great lengths to keep their marriage a secret, choosing to live in the very modest home of Alice's parents, British immigrants George Jones, a \"mulatto\" or \"colored\" man who worked as a taxi driver, and Elizabeth Jones, his white wife.\n\nDespite the Rhinelanders' best efforts at hiding their marriage, their secret was exposed. On November 13, 1924, the Standard Star of New Rochelle ran a story with the title \"Rhinelanders' Son Marries Daughter of a Colored Man.\" Thereafter, reporters swarmed the house of the Rhinelander newlyweds in an attempt to uncover the mystery of Alice's race and the cross-class marriage of a member of one of New York's most elite families. Two weeks later, Leonard filed for annulment of his marriage to Alice. Leonard argued that Alice had committed fraud that made their marriage void by both falsely telling him she was white and failing to inform him that she was of \"colored blood.\"\n\nAccording to newspaper reports and the arguments by Alice's lead trial attorney, Lee Parsons Davis, Leonard and Alice were actually madly in love. The story was that Leonard filed the lawsuit only because of his father, who refused to accept Alice as part of the family, and that Leonard told Alice to fight the case to ensure that they could be together as husband and wife. But in 1920s New York, what did Leonard's request mean? New York did not have a law that banned interracial marriages, but socially speaking, Alice and Leonard could not be together unless she, too, was white. Consequently, everyone expected Alice to litigate her whiteness. Yet Alice surprised everyone when she did not attempt to prove her whiteness at trial. She did not try to prolong the snapshot moments in which she had previously passed as \"white\" in places like the hotels she frequented with Leonard and even at the government office where she and Leonard obtained their marriage license. Rather, Alice admitted that she was of \"colored descent.\" Moreover, she argued that Leonard was aware of her race before the marriage.\n\nAlice's litigation choices meant the end of the Rhinelander marriage. If Leonard won, she would still lose him: Annulment would require the Rhinelander marriage to forever be erased from the books. If Alice won, which, at the time, seemed impossible given the vast differences in both their class and race statures, she still could not remain Leonard's wife because a poor, non-white woman could never be the wife of the wealthy, prominent, and most importantly, white Leonard Rhinelander.\n\nThe actual annulment trial of the Rhinelanders was filled with drama. The drama included, among other things, racy love letters; tales of pre-marital lust and sex; and the exposure of Alice's breasts, legs, and arms in the courtroom to prove that Leonard, who had seen her naked before marriage, would have known that she was \"colored\" at the time of their nuptials. The jury returned a verdict for Alice, determining both that she was colored and that Leonard knew of her racial background before marriage and wedded her regardless. As Professors Earl Lewis and Heidi Ardizzone explained in their book Love on Trial , \"Few had believed a white jury capable of such an unbiased finding.\" Juror Henry M. Weil explained to the public after the trial, \"If we had voted according to our hearts [which is the title of my book] the verdict might have been different.\" In other words, if they had followed their hearts, Leonard would have won instead.\n\nSeveral years later, the Rhinelander marriage officially ended with a divorce in Las Vegas. Life after the trial was depressing for both Alice and Leonard. Upon divorce, Leonard became a recluse. Even before the trial began, Leonard was shunned and excluded him from all \"clubs\" to which he had previously belonged, and disowned by his family, barred from the family business until he obtained the divorce. The Detroit Free Press reported his removal from the New York Social Register , on which his family was listed: \"Kip stands outside the fold the symbol of a proud family's shame. Kip now stands on a social register par with his Negro bride, who last spring sailed into the March supplement of the register for one fleeting cruise under her husband's colors, but was dropped overboard in the next edition.\"\n\nIn the end, Leonard never recaptured the life he had before Alice and certainly not the type of life he had with Alice. He died at the young age of 34 in February of 1936 without ever falling in love again and without remarrying.\n\nAlice lived until she was 89 years old, but never partnered with another man. In 1989, when Alice passed away, she left us with one last reminder of just how she really \"died\" more than sixty years earlier in 1925 at her infamous trial's end: she buried herself with a headstone that read \"Alice J. Rhinelander.\"\n\nSuch was my understanding of \"passing\" in marriage before I had any personal experience in it: I knew to what lengths Alice Rhinelander had gone, despite being deeply in love, not to have to endure it. Yet even the most heartrending of tales often fail to bring home the enormity of day-in, day-out anxiety and deception that \"passing\"--whether for interracial couples or for homosexual couples--entails.\n\nBefore my husband, Jacob, and I left for South Africa at the end of 2012, we pondered whether there would be any moments and, if so, how many moments there would be when we would have to pass -- not as individuals of one race, as Alice and Leonard did -- but instead as friends, rather than the married couple we are. Friends had relayed stories of difficulties traveling to this country so recently freed of apartheid, and we wanted to be cautious.\n\nWhat I ultimately discovered during our time in South Africa is that I still had much to learn about the damages that stem from passing. Peggy McIntosh in 1988 wrote a groundbreaking piece about white privilege. I was, in many ways, oblivious to the full extent of the heterosexual privilege that I possessed in the United States, even as a member of an interracial marriage. Although Jacob and I had experienced the fears of physically being pulled apart by strangers on the street, we, unlike the famous interracial Lovings , who took their case to the Supreme Court in 1967, had never been arrested, jailed, and threatened with a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nAs I was recently re-reading an excerpt from my journal from South Africa, I was reminded of just how little, then, I understood about the psychological harms of long-term passing. I had underestimated the severe emotional toll of hiding an important part of my authentic self, my life partner. I had miscalculated the exhaustion that would come from having to think carefully about every look and touch that he and I might venture to share. I had taken too lightly how passing sends implicit internal messages that one's relationship is wrong. I had undervalued the freedom I had, to some extent, come to take for granted. Describing the fears that I experienced about being part of an interracial couple just during my husband's and my travels down to South Africa, I wrote in relevant part:\n\nI am more wary here than in most places in the United States about stealing a touch, a glance, a kiss with my love. ... In my head, I imagined that Jacob and I would simply refrain from public displays of affection to avoid any harms ... I had imagined passing only in snapshots rather than marathon hours. Until I had to weigh each and every moment of potential intimacy with deliberate thought, and at all times, with fear of what any small action could bring upon us, I did not realize how often I--one who likes to think of herself as self-conscious about public displays of affection--stole a glance with Jacob, gave him a knowing smile, engaged in a short snuggle, or received quick sweet pecks on the lips. . . .\n\nRe-reading my own journal brought chills to my soul, particularly when I reached a section recalling Jacob's and my awkward indecision in an airport over our custom of having him hold both our passports. \"No, keep it,\" I had said. \"Be safe. If anyone tries to attack you, tell them you have to make sure your wife gets her passport back. . . .\"It is impossible to appreciate, until it is thrown into question, the simple importance of just getting back safely to be with the one you love.\n\nJacob and I both laughed out loud at our silliness, our paranoia, and our \"exaggerated fears.\" After our jokes, our natural instincts were to hug each other as we laughed, moving just as naturally towards a kiss, a kiss that I pulled away from or that I told myself we both pulled away from because we were so out in the open. . . .\n\nI have a close friend -- I'll call her Stephanie. She is in a relationship with a woman who cannot come out for fear of losing her job. I have had many conversations with Stephanie about her and her girlfriend's fears of being exposed, their close calls, and the uncertainty of not knowing when they can ever end their silence about and suppression of their love -- their \"passing.\" As the experience of Carla Hale, a well-regarded, veteran school teacher who was recently fired after she simply named her long-term partner in her mother's obituary has shown us, their fears are real.\n\nAlice Rhinelander passed originally by denying her blackness. I passed by denying my marriage. Stephanie and her love are passing both by denying their relationship and denying their sexual orientation.\n\nNot too long ago, my friend Stephanie told me that another friend remarked, listening to her laments, \"This, too, shall pass.\" When I heard this popular saying, one that I have heard used and have used myself so often to provide hope for others in despair, repeated in this context, I stopped in my tracks. The words rang differently in my head. They felt uneasy. All I could think was \"These two should not have to pass.\""

      "text": "Interracial Intimacy\n\nWhite-black dating, marriage, and adoption are on the rise. This development, however, is being met with resistance-more vocally by blacks than by whites\n\nAmericans are already what racial purists have long feared: a people characterized by a great deal of racial admixture, or what many in the past referred to distastefully as \"mongrelization.\" In pigmentation, width of noses, breadth of lips, texture of hair, and other telltale signs, the faces and bodies of millions of Americans bear witness to interracial sexual encounters. Some were joyful, passionate, loving affairs. Many were rapes. Others contained elements of both choice and coercion. These different kinds of interracial intimacy and sexual depredation all reached their peak in the United States during the age of slavery, and following the Civil War they decreased markedly. Since the end of the civil-rights revolution interracial dating, interracial sex, and interracial marriage have steadily increased, as has the number of children born of interracial unions. This development has prompted commentators to speak of the \"creolization\" or \"browning\" or \"beiging\" of America.\n\nOver the years legions of white-supremacist legislators, judges, prosecutors, police officers, and other officials have attempted to prohibit open romantic interracial attachments, particularly those between black men and white women. From the 1660s to the 1960s, forty-one territories, colonies, or states enacted laws-anti-miscegenation statutes-barring sex or marriage between blacks and whites, and many states ultimately made marriage across the color line a felony. Such laws crystallized attitudes about interracial intimacy that remain influential today, but all were invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967, in the most aptly named case in all of American constitutional history: Loving v. Commonwealth of Virginia . Although white and black Americans are far more likely to date and marry within their own race than outside it, the cultural environment has changed considerably since Loving . Recall what happened in the spring of 2000, when George W. Bush, at a crucial moment in his primary campaign, paid a highly publicized visit to Bob Jones University, in South Carolina. During that visit he offered no criticism of the university's then existing prohibition against interracial dating. In the controversy that ensued, no nationally prominent figures defended Bob Jones's policy. Public opinion not only forced Bush to distance himself from Bob Jones but also prompted the notoriously stubborn and reactionary administration of that institution to drop its ban.\n\nThe de-stigmatization in this country of interracial intimacy is profoundly encouraging. Against the tragic backdrop of American history, it is a sign that Frederick Douglass may have been right when he prophesied, even before the abolition of slavery, that eventually \"the white and colored people of this country [can] be blended into a common nationality, and enjoy together ... the inestimable blessings of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\"\n\nThe great but altogether predictable irony is that just as white opposition to white-black intimacy finally lessened, during the last third of the twentieth century, black opposition became vocal and aggressive. In college classrooms today, when discussions about the ethics of interracial dating and marriage arise, black students are frequently the ones most likely to voice disapproval.\n\nDespite some ongoing resistance (a subject to which I will return), the situation for people involved in interracial intimacy has never been better. For the most part, the law prohibits officials from taking race into account in licensing marriages, making child-custody decisions, and arranging adoptions. Moreover, the American public accepts interracial intimacy as it never has before. This trend will almost certainly continue; polling data and common observation indicate that young people tend to be more liberal on these matters than their elders.\n\nIn 1960 there were about 51,000 black-white married couples in the United States; in 1970 there were 65,000, in 1980 there were 121,000, in 1990 there were 213,000, and by 1998 the number had reached 330,000. In other words, in the past four decades black-white marriages increased more than sixfold. And black-white marriages are not only becoming more numerous. Previously, the new couples in mixed marriages tended to be older than other brides and grooms. They were frequently veterans of divorce, embarking on second or third marriages. In recent years, however, couples in mixed marriages seem to be marrying younger than their pioneering predecessors and seem more inclined to have children and to pursue all the other \"normal\" activities that married life offers.\n\nIt should be stressed that black-white marriages remain remarkably rare-fewer than one percent of the total. In 1998, when 330,000 black-white couples were married, 55,305,000 couples were married overall. Moreover, the racial isolation of blacks on the marriage market appears to be greater than that of other people of color: much larger percentages of Native Americans and Asian-Americans marry whites. According to 1990 Census data, in the age cohort twenty-five to thirty-four, 36 percent of U.S.-born Asian-American husbands and 45 percent of U.S.-born Asian-American wives had white spouses; 53 percent of Native American husbands and 54 percent of Native American wives had white spouses. Only eight percent of African-American husbands and only four percent of African-American wives had white spouses. The sociologist Nathan Glazer was correct in stating, in The Public Interest (September 1995), that \"blacks stand out uniquely among the array of American ethnic and racial groups in the degree to which marriage remains within the group.\" Of course, the Native American and Asian-American populations are so much smaller than the African-American population that relatively few intermarriages make a big difference in percentage terms. But the disparity is real: it has to do not only with demographics but also with generations' worth of subjective judgments about marriageability, beauty, personality, comfort, compatibility, and prestige. Even now a wide array of social pressures continue to make white-black marriages more difficult and thus less frequent than other interethnic or interracial marriages.\n\nNevertheless, the trend toward more interracial marriage is clear, as is a growing acceptance of the phenomenon. Successful, high-profile interracial couples include the white William Cohen (a former senator from Maine and the Secretary of Defense under Bill Clinton) and the black Janet Langhart; and the white Wendy Raines and the black Franklin Raines (he is a former director of the Office of Management and Budget and the CEO of Fannie Mae). Some African-Americans whose positions make them directly dependent on black public opinion have nonetheless married whites without losing their footing. A good example is Julian Bond, the chairman of the board of directors of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Though married to a white woman, Bond ascended to the chairmanship of the oldest and most influential black-advancement organization in the country in 1998, and as of this writing continues to enjoy widespread support within the NAACP.\n\nThere are other signs that black-white romance has become more widely accepted; indeed, it is quite fashionable in some contexts. One is advertising. When advertisers addressing general audiences use romance to deliver their messages, they most often depict couples of the same race. But now at least occasionally one sees interracial couples deployed as enticements to shop at Diesel or Club Monaco, or to buy furniture from ikea, jeans from Guess, sweaters from Tommy Hilfiger, cologne from Calvin Klein, or water from Perrier.\n\nScores of interracial support groups have emerged across the country, among them Kaleidoscope, at the University of Virginia; Students of Mixed Heritage at Amherst College; Interracial Family Club, in Washington, D.C.; Half and Half, at Bryn Mawr; and Mixed Plate, at Grinnell. Although most of these organizations lack deep roots, many display a vigor and resourcefulness that suggest they will survive into the foreseeable future. They stem from and represent a community in the making. It is a community united by a demand that the larger society respect and be attentive to people who by descent or by choice fall outside conventional racial groupings: interracial couples, parents of children of a different race, and children of parents of a different race. Those within this community want it known that they are not products or agents of an alarming mongrelization, as white racists still believe; nor are they inauthentic and unstable in-betweeners, as some people of color would have it. They want security amid the established communities from which they have migrated. They want to emerge from what the writer Lise Funderburg has identified as the \"racial netherworld,\" and they want to enjoy interaction with others without regret or fear, defensiveness or embarrassment.\n\nAfrican-Americans largely fall into three camps with respect to white-black marriage. One camp, relatively small, openly champions it as a good. Its members argue that increasing rates of interracial marriage will decrease social segregation, encourage racial open-mindedness, enhance blacks' access to enriching social networks, elevate their status, and empower black women in their interactions with black men by subjecting the latter to greater competition in the marketplace for companionship.\n\nA second camp sees interracial marriage merely as a choice that individuals should have the right to make. For example, while noting in Race Matters (1993) that \"more and more white Americans are willing to interact sexually with black Americans on an equal basis ,\" Cornel West maintains that he views this as \"neither cause for celebration nor reason for lament.\" This is probably the predominant view among blacks. It allows a person simultaneously to oppose anti-miscegenation laws and to disclaim any desire to marry across racial lines. Many African-Americans are attracted to this position, because, among other things, it helps to refute a deeply annoying assumption on the part of many whites: that blacks would like nothing more than to be intimate with whites and even, if possible, to become white.\n\nA third camp opposes interracial marriage, on the grounds that it expresses racial disloyalty, suggests disapproval of fellow blacks, undermines black culture, weakens the African-American marriage market, and feeds racist mythologies, particularly the canard that blacks lack pride of race.\n\nSuch opposition has always been a powerful undercurrent. When Walter White, the executive secretary of the NAACP, divorced his black wife (the mother of their two children) and married a white woman from South Africa, in 1949, the Norfolk (Virginia) Journal and Guide spoke for many blacks when it asserted, \"A prompt and official announcement that [White] will not return to his post ... is in order.\" Part of the anger stemmed from apprehension that segregationists would seize upon White's marriage to substantiate the charge that what black male civil-rights activists were really after was sex with white women. Part stemmed from a widespread sense that perhaps White thought no black woman was good enough for him.\n\nBy the late 1960s, with the repudiation of anti-miscegenation and Jim Crow laws, increasing numbers of blacks felt emboldened to openly oppose mixed marriages. \"We Shall Overcome\" was giving way to \"Black Power\": improving the image of blacks in the minds of whites seemed less important than cultivating a deeper allegiance to racial solidarity. To blacks, interracial intimacy compromised that allegiance. The African-American social reformer George Wiley dedicated himself to struggles for racial justice as a leading figure in the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE) and the founder of the National Welfare Rights Organization. Yet many black activists denounced him for marrying and remaining married to a white woman. When he addressed a rally in Washington, D.C., on African Liberation Day in April of 1972, a group of black women heckled him by chanting, \"Where's your white wife? Where's your white wife?\" When he attempted to focus his remarks on the situation of black women, the hecklers merely took up a different chant: \"Talking black and sleeping white.\"\n\nOther politically active blacks married to whites-James Farmer, a founder of CORE, and Julius Hobson, a tenacious activist in Washington-faced similar pressure. Julius Lester, a longtime member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, wrote a book with one of the most arresting titles of that flamboyant era: Look Out, Whitey! Black Power's Gon' Get Your Mama! (1968). But to many black activists, Lester's writings and ideas were decidedly less significant than his choice of a white wife. To them, his selection bespoke hypocrisy. Ridiculing Lester, one black woman wrote a letter to the editor of Ebony in which she suggested that it was foolish to regard him as a trustworthy leader. After all, she cautioned, he couldn't even \"crawl out of bed\" with whites.\n\nThe \"sleeping white\" critique embarrassed a wide variety of people as distinctions between the personal and the political evaporated. At many colleges and universities black students ostracized other blacks who dated (much less married) whites. A black student who wanted to walk around \"with a blonde draped on his arm\" could certainly do so, a black student leader at the University of Washington told St. Clair Drake, a leading African-American sociologist. \"All we say,\" the student continued, \"is don't try to join the black studies association.\" Drake himself became the target of this critique. When he visited his old high school in 1968, he says, the Black Student Union refused to have anything to do with him, because he was involved in an interracial relationship. Drake's classmate Charles V. Hamilton, a co-author, with Stokely Carmichael, of Black Power: The Politics of Liberation in America (1967), was shunned for the same reason.\n\nIn some instances black opposition to interracial intimacy played a part in destroying a marriage. A dramatic example is the breakup of Everett LeRoi Jones (now known as Amiri Baraka) and Hettie Jones. LeRoi Jones was born of middle-class black parents in Newark, New Jersey, in 1934. For two years he attended Howard University, which he detested. He served in the Air Force for a short time, and in 1957 he moved to Greenwich Village. He worked for the magazine Record Changer and was a co-editor, with Hettie Cohen, of Yugen , an avant-garde magazine that published writings by William Burroughs, Gregory Corso, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Charles Olson, and Jones himself. Hettie Cohen was a woman of Jewish parentage who had grown up in suburban New York and attended Mary Washington, the women's college of the University of Virginia. Jones and Cohen married in 1958. Although his parents accepted the marriage easily, her parents totally opposed it.\n\nFor a while LeRoi and Hettie Jones lived together in what she remembers as a loving relationship. But then the pressure of bohemian penury, the demands of two children, and mutual infidelities (including one in which LeRoi fathered a baby by another woman who also happened to be white) caused their marriage to falter. Other forces also emerged to doom the union: LeRoi's deep internal tensions, his ambition to become a black leader, and the growing sense in many black communities that no purported leader could be trusted who \"talked black but slept white.\"\n\nAs the black protest movement gathered steam in the early sixties, Jones aimed at becoming an important figure in it. At the same time, his career as a writer blossomed. He wrote well-regarded poetry, social and political essays, and a significant book, Blues People (1963), on the history of African-American music. What made LeRoi Jones a celebrity, however, and what ensures him a niche in American literary history, is his two-act play Dutchman , which opened in New York City in March of 1964. In Dutchman a reticent, bookish middle-class black man named Clay meets a white temptress named Lula in a New York subway car. The play consists mainly of their verbal combat. Angered by Clay's refusal to dance with her, Lula shouts, \"Come on, Clay. Let's rub bellies on the train ... Forget your social-working mother for a few seconds and let's knock stomachs. Clay, you liver-lipped white man. You would-be Christian. You ain't no nigger, you're just a dirty white man.\" Clay responds in kind.\n\nBut Lula has the last word, so to speak: she suddenly stabs Clay to death. Other passengers throw his body out of the subway car and depart. Alone, Lula re-occupies her seat. When another black man enters the car, she begins her lethal routine anew.\n\nThough living in a predominantly white, bohemian environment when he wrote Dutchman , Jones had begun to believe that it was blacks to whom he should be addressing his art. Increasingly successful, he was also becoming increasingly radical in his condemnation of white American society. Asked by a white woman what white people could do to help the race problem, Jones replied, \"You can help by dying. You are a cancer. You can help the world's people with your death.\" An outrageous statement coming from anyone, this comment was even more arresting coming from a man who was married to a white woman. Jones was by no means alone in living within this particular contradiction. He noted in his autobiography that at one point he and some other black intellectuals objected to the presence of white radicals on a committee they were in the process of establishing. \"What was so wild,\" he recalled, \"was that some of us were talking about how we didn't want white people on the committee but we were all hooked up to white women ... Such were the contradictions of that period of political organization.\"\n\nThe more prominent Jones became, however, the more critics, both black and white, charged him with being hypocritical. The critic Stanley Kauffmann, for example, asserted that Jones constituted an exemplary figure in \"the Tradition of the Fake.\" Stung by such charges, infatuated with black-nationalist rhetoric, inspired by the prospect of re-creating himself, and bored with a disappointing marriage, LeRoi Jones divorced Hettie Jones in 1965.\n\nThroughout the black-power era substantial numbers of African-Americans loudly condemned black participation in interracial relationships (especially with whites), deeming it to be racial betrayal. A reader named Joyce Blake searingly articulated this sentiment in a letter to the editor of the Village Voice .\n\nAlthough racial solidarity has been the principal reason for black opposition to intermarriage over the years, another reason is the perception that intermarriage by black men weakens black women in the marriage market. A reader named Lula Miles asserted this view in an August 1969 letter to the editor of Ebony . Responding to a white woman who had expressed bewilderment at black women's anger, Miles wrote, \"Non-sister wonders why the sight of a black man with a white woman is revolting to a black woman ... The name of the game is 'competition.' Non-sister, you are trespassing!\"\n\nAnother letter writer, named Miraonda J. Stevens, reinforced this point: \"In the near future there aren't going to be enough nice black men around for us [black women] to marry.\" This \"market\" critique of interracial marriage has a long history. In 1929 Palestine Wells, a black columnist for the Baltimore Afro-American , wrote,\n\nForty-five years later an Ebony reader named Katrina Williams echoed Wells. \"The white man is marrying the white woman,\" she wrote. \"The black man is marrying the white woman. Who's gonna marry me?\"\n\nBehind her anxious question resides more than demographics: there is also the perception that large numbers of African-American men believe not only that white women are relatively more desirable but that black women are positively unattractive. Again the pages of Ebony offer vivid testimony. A reader named Mary A. Dowdell wrote in 1969,\n\nDecades later African-American hostility to interracial intimacy remained widespread and influential. Three examples are revealing. The first is the movie Jungle Fever (1991), which portrays an interracial affair set in New York City in the early 1990s. The director, Spike Lee, made sure the relationship was unhappy. Flipper Purify is an ambitious, college-educated black architect who lives in Harlem with his black wife and their young daughter. Angie Tucci, a young white woman, works for Purify as a secretary. Educated only through high school, she lives in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, with her father and brothers, all of whom are outspoken racists. One evening when Flipper and Angie stay late at his office, work is superseded by erotic longing tinged with racial curiosity. He has never been sexually intimate with a white woman, and she has never been sexually intimate with a black man. They close that gap in their experience, and then stupidly confide in indiscreet friends, who carelessly reveal their secret. Angie's father throws her out of the family home after viciously beating her for \"fucking a black nigger.\" Flipper's wife, Drew, throws him out as well. Flipper and Angie move into an apartment together, but that arrangement falls apart rather quickly under the pressure of their own guilt and uncertainty and the strong disapproval they encounter among blacks and whites alike.\n\nThe second example is Lawrence Otis Graham's 1995 essay \"I Never Dated a White Girl.\" Educated at Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Graham sought to explain why \"black middle-class kids ... [who are] raised in integrated or mostly white neighborhoods, [and] told to befriend white neighbors, socialize and study with white classmates, join white social and professional organizations, and go to work for mostly white employers\" are also told by their relatives, \"Oh, and by the way, don't ever forget that you are black, and that you should never get so close to whites that you happen to fall in love with them.\" Graham did more than explain, however; he justified this advice in a candid polemic that might well have been titled \"Why I Am Proud That I Never Dated a White Girl.\"\n\nThe third example is \"Black Men, White Women: A Sister Relinquishes Her Anger,\" a 1993 essay by the novelist Bebe Moore Campbell. Describing a scene in which she and her girlfriends spied a handsome black celebrity escorting a white woman at a trendy Beverly Hills restaurant, Campbell wrote,\n\nOnly a small percentage of black men marry interracially; one report, published in 1999, estimated that seven percent of married black men have non-black wives. But with poverty, imprisonment, sexual orientation, and other factors limiting the number of marriageable black men, a substantial number of black women feel this loss of potential mates acutely. In 1992 researchers found that for every three unmarried black women in their twenties there was only one unmarried black man with earnings above the poverty level. Given these realities, black women's disparagement of interracial marriage should come as no surprise. \"In a drought,\" Campbell wrote, \"even one drop of water is missed.\"\n\nCompiling a roster of prominent blacks-Clarence Thomas, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Quincy Jones, Franklin A. Thomas, John Edgar Wideman-married to or otherwise romantically involved with whites, Graham voiced disappointment. When a prominent black role model \"turns out to be married to a white mate,\" he wrote, \"our children say, 'Well, if it's so good to be black, why do all my role models date and marry whites?' ... As a child growing up in the 'black is beautiful' 1970s, I remember asking these questions.\"\n\nAnticipating the objection that his views amount to \"reverse racism,\" no less an evil than anti-black bigotry, Graham wrote that his aim was neither keeping the races separate nor assigning superiority to one over the other. Rather, he wanted to develop \"solutions for the loss of black mentors and role models at a time when the black community is overrun with crime, drug use, a high dropout rate, and a sense that any black who hopes to find ... career success must necessarily disassociate himself from his people with the assistance of a white spouse.\" He maintained,\n\nAlthough Graham's view is widespread, there are blacks who not only tolerate but applaud increasing rates of interracial intimacy. The most outspoken and distinguished African-American proponent of free trade in the marital marketplace is the Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson. Patterson makes three main claims. First, he maintains that interracial marriage typically gives people access to valuable new advice, know-how, and social networks. \"When we marry,\" he writes in Rituals of Blood: Consequences of Slavery in Two American Centuries , \"we engage in an exchange of social and cultural dowries potentially far more valuable than gold-rimmed china. The cultural capital exchanged in ethnic intermarriage is considerably greater than that within ethnic groups.\"\n\nPatterson's second claim is that removing the informal racial boundaries within the marriage market would especially benefit black women-because large numbers of white men are and will increasingly become open to marrying black women, if given a chance. He notes that if only one in five nonblack men were to court black women, the pool of potential spouses available to those women would immediately double. According to Patterson, this would be good not only because it would make marriage more accessible to black women but also because larger numbers of white (and other) suitors might well fortify black women in their dealings with black men. As Patterson sees it, by forswearing nonblack suitors, many black women have senselessly put themselves at the mercy of black men, who have declined to be as accommodating as they might be in the face of greater competition.\n\nPatterson's third claim is that widespread intermarriage is necessary to the integration of blacks into American society. He agrees with the writer Calvin Hernton that intermarriage is \"the crucial test in determining when a people have completely won their way into the mainstream of any given society.\" In Ordeals of Integration he therefore urges blacks, particularly women, to renounce their objections to interracial intimacy. Higher rates of intermarriage \"will complete the process of total integration as [blacks] become to other Americans not only full members of the political and moral community, but also people whom 'we' marry,\" he counsels. \"When that happens, the goal of integration will have been fully achieved.\"\n\nSome may question whether higher rates of interracial marriage will do as much or signify as much as Patterson contends. The history of racially divided societies elsewhere suggests that it will not. Addressing \"the uncertain legacy of miscegenation,\" Professor Anthony W. Marx, of Columbia University, writes that despite considerable race mixing in Brazil, and that country's formal repudiation of racism, Brazil nonetheless retains \"an informal racial order that [discriminates] against 'blacks and browns.'\" Contrary to optimistic projections, Brazil's multiracialism did not so much produce upward mobility for dark Brazilians as reinforce a myth of mobility. That myth has undergirded a pigmentocracy that continues to privilege whiteness. A similar outcome is possible in the United States. Various peoples of color-Latinos, Asian-Americans, Native Americans, and light-skinned African-Americans-could well intermarry with whites in increasingly large numbers and join with them in a de facto alliance against darker-skinned blacks, who might remain racial outcasts even in a more racially mixed society.\n\nHistorically, though, at least in the United States, openness to interracial marriage has been a good barometer of racial enlightenment in thought and practice. As a general rule, those persons most welcoming of interracial marriage (and other intimate interracial associations) are also those who have most determinedly embraced racial justice, a healthy respect for individualistic pluralism, and a belief in the essential oneness of humanity."

      "text": "The Work Factor\n\nIn all the hysteria around the dating lives of single black women, there's always this discussion of whether white men, and to some extent black men, actually find black women attractive. Many factors, stretching across races and political ideology, are at work here. There is history--the corollary to the white supremacist notion of lazy and stupid black men, has always been overly masculine, coarse, unattractive black women. There is a peculiar, but human, reaction to demographics: interracial marriage has grown exponentially since the '60s, but  black men marrying non-black women is still a relatively rare event. But we'd rather obsess over the motives of  the eight percent of married black men who have non-black spouses, and pretend that those fictional motives say something about the remaining 92 percent do not."

The last time the state amended its constitution to regulate marriage, it was to ban miscegenation, Think Progress tweets (pictured at left). And just like in the bad old days, the southerners can count on some northerners to help ensure that couples can't skirt the law. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney proudly says that when he was governor, \" On my watch, we fought hard and prevented Massachusetts from becoming the Las Vegas of gay marriage .\" He accomplished this by invoking a 1913 law meant to keep out-of-state interracial couples from coming to Massachusetts to get married.\n\nIt is clear from the most recent available evidence on the psycho-sociological aspect of this question that intermarried families are subjected to much greater pressures and problems then those of the intermarried and that the state's prohibition of interracial marriage for this reason stands on the same footing as the prohibition of polygamous marriage, or incestuous marriage or the prescription of minimum ages at which people may marry and the prevention of the marriage of people who are mentally incompetent.\n\nNow if the state has an interest in marriage, if it has an interest in maximizing the number of stable marriages and in protecting the progeny of interracial marriages from these problems, then clearly. there is scientific evidence available that is so. It is not infrequent that the children of intermarried parents are referred to not merely as the children of intermarried parents but as the 'victims' of intermarried parents and as the 'martyrs' of intermarried parents."

They were two of the plaintiffs in the historic 2008 lawsuit that held California's ban on same-sex marriage violated the state constitution. They have been together for 26 years and married in 2008 before Prop 8 passed. Both work at Marriage Equality USA : Gaffney is the media director, and Lewis is the legal director. In addition, Gaffney reflects on the legal challenges surrounding his parents' marriage - his mother is Chinese American, and his father is white. In 1948, the California Supreme Court legalized interracial marriage, but other states did not recognize their marriage. [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we're joined by Stuart Gaffney and John Lewis, a married couple from California deeply involved in the struggle to legalize same-sex marriage. They've been together for 26 years. They married in 2008 before Prop 8 passed. Both work at Marriage Equality USA . Stuart is the media director, and John, the legal director.\n\nStuart and John, we welcome you both to Democracy Now! First, as you sat in the Supreme Court yesterday, watching the arguments, can you talk about how you felt, as a married couple, also as two people deeply involved in the effort to overturn this proposition that the Supreme Court justices were considering yesterday? John, let's begin with you.\n\nJOHN LEWIS : Yes, well, these cases are extremely emotional and extremely personal to us, because in the courtroom you hear abstract, somewhat appearing abstract legal theories being discussed, but these cases are truly about the lives of loving, committed same-sex couples and their children and their families. And so, it was a very, very emotional day, because so much is at stake for our lives.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Stuart, your response to what you sat through yesterday? Did you think you would be sitting there when you met 26 years ago?\n\nSTUART GAFFNEY : You know, the sense of the historic moment hanging over these cases is incredible, and the atmosphere is really electric. We were plaintiffs in the California state case for equal marriage rights decided in 2008 by the California Supreme Court, so we were proud to be at the Supreme Court standing with the plaintiffs in these historic cases and with the legal teams, but really with the community, because, like our case in California, these are really the community's lawsuits. As my husband said, it really feels like our very lives are before the court. But there's no mistaking this historic moment. The momentum leading up to these hearings is incredible. Every day, when we turn to the headlines, there's some new poll showing increasing majority support nationwide for equal marriage rights.\n\nWe've come to Washington at several other historic junctures to protest the Bowers v. Hardwick decision in 1986 upholding sodomy laws, to celebrate the Lawrence v. Texas decision in 2003, which overturned sodomy laws. And we came back in 2004 after we exchanged vows in San Francisco City Hall. We came here on a bus tour across the country with other same-sex couples married in city hall and our friends and loved ones and allies and supporters to rally in Washington. And at that point, we really thought this is going to happen in our lifetimes. But now we're here, and we know it's happening in our lifetimes. In fact, it's happening as we speak. And these justices really need to decide what side of history they want to be on.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Attorney Charles Cooper represented ProtectMarriage.com and defended Prop 8 before the Supreme Court. He and Justice Anthony Kennedy sparred over the welfare of children of same-sex couples.\n\nJUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY : I think that there's substantial-that there's substance to the point that sociological information is new. We have five years of information to weigh against 2,000 years of history, or more. On the other hand, there is an immediate legal injury, or legal-what could be a legal injury, and that's the voice of these children. There are some 40,000 children in California, according to the red brief, that live with same-sex parents, and they want their parents to have full recognition and full status. The voice of those children is important in this case, don't you think?\n\nCHARLES COOPER : Your Honor, I certainly would not dispute the importance of that consideration. That consideration, especially in the political process, where this issue is being debated and will continue to be debated, certainly in California, is being debated elsewhere. But-but on that specific question, Your Honor, there simply is no data. In fact, their expert agreed there is no data, no study even, that would examine whether or not there is any incremental beneficial effect from marriage over and above the domestic partnership laws that were enacted by the state of California to recognize, support and honor same-sex relationships and their families. There's simply no data at all that would-that would permit one to draw-draw that conclusion.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was attorney Charles Cooper. And before that, you heard Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was raising the issue of the 40,000 children of same-sex couples in California. Stuart Gaffney-or rather, John Lewis, as the legal director of Marriage Equality, can you talk about the legal argument here and what is suggested by what Justice Kennedy says about where he might vote, the key swing voter here?\n\nJOHN LEWIS : Well, I was very impressed and encouraged by the way he talked about the real lives of those 40,000 children of same-sex couples. I think that the evidence is actually quite clear that lesbian and gay people are doing wonderful jobs raising kids. There's actually a tremendous amount of study having been devoted to the issue. There's decades of experience. Last week, the American Academy of Pediatricians came out in favor of marriage equality, and that's a very, very strong endorsement of how having the freedom to marry for a family is actually very beneficial to those children.\n\nI think, in looking at the broadest context of the case, when we heard questions from the justices over all sorts of issues, from the procedural standing issues to questions about the particular circumstances in California and Proposition 8, to some of the broader questions about the freedom to marry as a right of every American, it's very difficult to predict where any of the justices are actually going to come out in the end. I'm very hopeful that when it's all said and done, that through one route or another Proposition 8 will no longer be enforceable after this case is decided.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Justice Scalia asked the plaintiffs' attorney, Theodore Olson, when it became unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage.\n\nJUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : You've led me right into a question I was going to ask. The California Supreme Court decides what the law is. That's what we decide, right? We don't prescribe law for the future. We decide what the law is. I'm curious: When did-when did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage? 1791? 1868, when the 14th Amendment was adopted? Sometimes-sometime after Baker , where we said it didn't even raise a substantial federal question? When-\n\nTHEODORE OLSON : When-\n\nJUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : When did the law become this?\n\nTHEODORE OLSON : May I answer this in the form of a rhetorical question? When did it become unconstitutional to prohibit interracial marriages? When did it become unconstitutional to assign children to separate schools?\n\nJUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : Easy questions. Was it always unconstitutional?\n\nTHEODORE OLSON : It was constitutional when we, as a culture, determined that sexual orientation is a characteristic of individuals that they cannot control, and that that-\n\nJUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : I see. When did that happen? When did that happen?\n\nTHEODORE OLSON : There's no specific date in time. This is an [inaudible]-\n\nJUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : Well, how am I supposed to know how to decide a case-\n\nTHEODORE OLSON : Because the case that's before you-\n\nJUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA : -if you can't give me a date when the Constitution changes?\n\nTHEODORE OLSON : The case that's before you today, California decided at-the citizens of California decided, after the California Supreme Court decided that individuals had a right to get married irrespective of their sexual orientation in California. And then the Californians decided in Proposition 8: \"Wait a minute, we don't want those people to be able to get married.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You've been listening to Justice Antonin Scalia questioning Theodore Olson, who, you might remember, was the solicitor general under George [W.] Bush, lost his wife on the plane that flew into Washington, D.C., on September 11th. John Lewis, your response?\n\nJOHN LEWIS : Well, Justice Scalia represents the minority view on the court. And in fact, Justice Kennedy wrote the majority view, which is the law of the land with respect to this issue, and quite eloquently, at the conclusion of Lawrence v. Texas . Justice Kennedy articulated how the basic guarantees of freedom and equality contained in our Constitution are stated as general propositions by the founders, by those who wrote the amendments to the Bill of Rights, because they recognized that as our nation evolves, that later generations that come after the 14th and the Fifth Amendment were drafted-that later generations will see that laws once thought necessary and appropriate only serve to oppress, and that later generations will invoke these basic, time-honored principles of the Constitution of liberty and equality for their generation in what is an ever-increasing notion of liberty and equality.\n\nAnd I think that's exactly what is at issue with the freedom to marry. Lesbian and gay people have been having loving, committed relationships for centuries. It's just the truth. But we've had to have those relationships in hiding because of the real threat to our lives, our very safety. And it's only in the last, you know, 50 years that brave men and women started coming out and we started living our lives openly and proudly. And now, through the marriage equality movement, we are coming out fully about the truth of our loving, committed relationships and our families. So, those basic guarantees of liberty and equality have always been there. And what we're seeing now is those laws, that maybe were once thought appropriate, actually just serve to oppress people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : John, I want to ask your husband, Stuart Gaffney, a question about history, since we were just listening to this discussion of Justice Scalia asking Ted Olson-who, by the way, was the solicitor general under George W. Bush-when it became unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage, about your own interesting family history, Stuart, when it comes to issues of marriage and the law.\n\nSTUART GAFFNEY : Yeah, I was moved by Theodore Olson's response there in talking about the rights of interracial couples, because-thinking of another married couple. That's my own mom and dad, who were an interracial couple facing barriers just like John and I face today. My mom is Chinese American; my dad is English and Irish American. They were only able to marry legally in California because our state Supreme Court led the way in overturning a law banning interracial marriage as unconstitutional. But after they married, they moved around the country, and our family had different legal status in every state they lived in. They moved to Missouri and were told that they had an illegal marriage. And that is something that I never wanted to have in common with them. But unfortunately, same-sex couples now face that same patchwork-legal in some states, illegal in others, and unrecognized federally. My parents were only legal in all 50 states when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1967 in Loving v. Virginia that all remaining state bans for interracial couples were unconstitutional. And they fulfilled the promise that's written on the front of the U.S. Supreme Court: equal justice under law. Our family is now waiting for that promise to be fulfilled for the next generation. And for my mom and dad, they want nothing more than for me and John to be able to be legally married in all 50 states, just as they were.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you both for being with us. We're going to continue on this issue in the next break. Stuart Gaffney and John Lewis have been our first guests today, married for-well, together for 26 years, married in 2008 before Prop 8 passed. Both work at Marriage Equality USA , Stuart the media director, John is the legal director. When we come back, we'll be joined by the widower of the late Congressmember Gerry Studds, openly gay congressmember. His widower is not able to get the normal pensions that other widows or widowers of congressmembers get. And we'll talk to him about today's Supreme Court arguments.

He discusses the lessons he drew from his mother, Ann Todd Jealous, and his grandmother, Mamie Todd, about the racism they experienced in their lifetimes. Jealous has led the NAACP and the progressive advocacy group People for the American Way, and is set to be the next executive director of the Sierra Club.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we turn from the 100th anniversary of the Rosewood massacre in Florida to Ben Jealous, former head of the NAACP for years, then head of People for the American Way, and now soon to be the head of the Sierra Club. He's now a professor of practice at the University of Pennsylvania and has just written a new memoir - it's out today - Never Forget Our People Were Always Free: A Parable of American Healing .\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Ben. It's great to have you with us. Congratulations on the publication of your memoir. As we talk about history today, I want to go back to your grandmother and her grandfather, who was born into slavery. Both you are the descendant of enslaved people and Confederate generals.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Yes. Yeah, my grandmother's grandfather grew up a slave in Virginia, knowing that his owner was his uncle, knowing that Robert E. Lee was his cousin. And he, on the other side of slavery, built a populist movement in the gap between the end of Reconstruction and the start of Jim Crow with a former Confederate general. And together, they saved the free public schools of the state. That was their cause. They also built Virginia Tech - expanded it radically, rather, and they created the first public Black college south of the Mississippi. It's just a bold testament to what can happen when we come together. They also abolished the poll tax and the public whipping post. So there you have it, Amy. I mean, we were never taught that there was ever a time when former Confederates and former slaves came together, let alone with a pro-civil rights, pro-public education, pro-workers' rights platform.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ben, could you talk about your mother, as well? She co-authored the book Combined Destinies: Whites Sharing Grief about Racism and went in depth in that book into more than 50 white people whose lives were deeply affected by racism in America?\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Yeah, this is a book about how racism against Blacks hurts white people. I grew up on a bridge between Black and white, and North and South, and even the old world of the East Coast and the cutting edge of California. My parents built that bridge for their kids, trying to show us that we could be one country. That's what really motivated me in my book.\n\nBut her book was really motivated, in part, by being married to a man who loved his grandfather and yet was disowned by his grandfather. His brothers stood by him. His mom stood by him. But his grandfather disowned him, disinherited them, sent my father into poverty. And, you know, that, watching a white man be attacked by his own grandfather for - because he loved a woman of a different hue really made her realize what Dr. King said was real, that we're all inextricably linked. There is no - there is no hurting one member of the human family and not hurting yourself.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben, as Juan raised your mother, and I asked about your grandmother, we want to put the three of you together. In 2009, when you were head of the NAACP , you went to a StoryCorps booth, and you talked with your mother, Ann Todd Jealous, and your grandmother, Mamie Todd, about how they responded to some of the racism they experienced in their lifetimes. This aired on NPR's Morning Edition and starts with your grandmother describing how she taught at an all-Black school in Virginia, where students lacked pencils and paper or books or a working chalkboard. This is what happened when she went to demand changes from the white superintendent of schools.\n\nMAMIE TODD : I went up to the secretary's desk and said, \"I have an appointment.\" And she says, \"Well, the colored teachers come around the back.\" I said, \"Beg your pardon?\" She said, \"Colored teachers come around the back.\" I said, \"Well, there's his desk right there.\" And so I walked on through and went to his desk. He was sitting there. He didn't stand up. And there was a chair in front of his desk, so I sat there. And he and I had a conversation. And I just told him how I felt, how I really felt about it. And he was a human being. I knew we had that much in common. And I wasn't afraid of him. And I -\n\nANN TODD JEALOUS : Were you ever afraid of anybody?\n\nMAMIE TODD : Oh, I don't know. I have to think about it. I have to think about it. Anyway, the next day, about 10:30 in the morning, a pickup truck came to school laden with materials, I mean blackboards hanging over the sides. And I had everything I could think of that I had told him that school needed.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : While we're talking about protests, Mom, tell me about desegregating your high school.\n\nANN TODD JEALOUS : When I first went there, I remember being assigned a seat, and there was this other girl sitting in my seat. So I went up to say to her, you know, \"You're in my seat.\" And she fell onto the floor, she was so terrified. And then I remember -\n\nBEN JEALOUS : You're really not very scary, Mom.\n\nANN TODD JEALOUS : I was not. I'm probably more scary now in my old age. The rumor was that we all carried knives, and she was afraid that I would stick a knife in her for sitting in my seat. And actually, I was asking her to move because I was afraid of the teacher, you know, being upset.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Mimi, what was it like for you to watch her go through this.\n\nMAMIE TODD : It was very difficult, but she kept a lot of it to herself.\n\nANN TODD JEALOUS : I did not want to burden them. I was an only child, and my parents talked a lot. And I grew up with their stories, and so I was very, very conscious of a great deal that they carried as a consequence of racism. So I kept as much as I could to myself.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Wow. Thanks, Mom.\n\nANN TODD JEALOUS : You're welcome, Ben. Thanks for being interested.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Yeah.\n\nANN TODD JEALOUS : Thanks for asking.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Thanks, Mimi.\n\nMAMIE TODD : Good luck to you, darling.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Yeah.\n\nMAMIE TODD : There's a lot to be done.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Yeah, that's right.\n\nMAMIE TODD : There's a lot left to be done.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, there you have Ben Jealous speaking with his mother, Ann Todd Jealous, and his grandmother, Mamie Todd. Ben, as you come out with your memoir, you are the son of a white father and a Black mother who left Baltimore after they married. Interracial marriage then was illegal. You write about being a cousin to both Thomas Jefferson and Robert E. Lee, and you found out you're distantly related to Dick Cheney. Talk about the writing of this memoir, what you discovered, and why you feel it's important as a - really, a memoir, narrative of this entire country.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Virginia really is the cradle of our country. And I didn't know most of this. You know, like your guest said about Rosewood, like, our elders really don't speak about the painful parts. Well, my grandmother, you heard her. When she went into that superintendent's office, part of the reason she insisted on going through the front door was her father's name was over the front door - her grandfather's name, rather, because he had saved the free public schools in that county and in that state, not just as a leader of formerly enslaved men, but as a leader of former Confederate soldiers, as well. But I wasn't taught this history.\n\nAnd the moment that I realized that, you know, like, Robert E. Lee and Dick Cheney are both my cousins, like, the country felt very small - I just got my first copy on the way over here - and in a way that just, like, made my mind explode.\n\nBut the moment I figured out that my grandmother's beloved grandfather, that his political partner was a former Confederate general and a man who qualified as a war criminal, too - he had massacred an entire Black regiment that surrendered. And yet here they were, 15 years after the war, five years into the reign of terror of the Ku Klux Klan. And while that old war criminal looked like a pretty good ally - like, let the Klan deal with him; we don't have to deal with him anymore - and they banded together. They took over the entire Virginia state government - the governor, both senators, both houses. They asserted this agenda. They would ultimately be put down by violent white supremacists and disinformation campaigns.\n\nBut what's remarkable, Amy, is they planted the seeds for FDR's coalition in that state. It was their old lieutenants who would be his - their young lieutenants who would be his old lieutenants in the state. And they demonstrated yet again that there's a magnetism between the working people of this country across all the lines they use to divide us, wanting to come together. Why? Because our kids need us to.\n\nSo, every time now I see Virginia Tech or I see Virginia State or I see a public school in Virginia, I'm reminded these exist the way that we know them because former Confederate soldiers and formerly enslaved men came together, built a third party, took over their state, and asserted their rights and those of their children.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ben, in terms of the lessons for today, especially in the aftermath of the January 6th insurrection and the continued rise and consolidation of a right-wing, neofascist movement in this country, what do you - talk to us about what lessons you draw that today's generation of activists could learn from.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : We have more in common than we don't. And that's always been the case, and it always will be the case.\n\nOne of the mysteries that my grandmother gave me, she would say, \"Never forget: Before there were slave rebellions, there were colonial rebellions.\"\n\nCharles V. Hamilton, the co-author of Black Power , who was my professor in college, he said the exact same thing, but he went further. He said, \"Politics is a lot like physics. Something in motion will return to its original state.\" And he said, \"As Americans, we misremember our original state, because we only focus on movies and TV shows that show us slavery near the end. In the beginning, they weren't just slave rebellions; they were colonial rebellions. There were white European indentured servants and African slaves rising up together.\" And he said, \"If you really go back and you look at it, you'll understand that's where we're headed, that we're going to come together.\" He believed that. I believe that. You see evidence of it all around.\n\nIt's the politicians, it's the 24-hour news often that profit by keeping us divided. But in our hearts, the people of this country want to come together. They know that our kids will do better if we do.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Ben, we're going to do Part 2 of this conversation and post it online at democracynow.org. I think I met you years ago on the grounds of the prison in Jackson, Georgia, where Troy Anthony Davis was executed and you were protesting outside. We're going to talk about mass incarceration, the death penalty and so many other issues with Ben Jealous, former president of the NAACP , then People for the American Way, now, coming up, will head the Sierra Club. He is the grandson of Mamie Todd, who died last year at the age of 105. She was an outspoken civil rights activist whose work as a social worker led to Maryland's Child Protective Service Agency.

In a 5-to-4 decision, the court ruled the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act - or DOMA - signed by President Clinton into law is unconstitutional. This means that legally married same-sex couples are entitled to claim the same 1,100 federal benefits as heterosexual couples. The Supreme Court also ruled supporters of the Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriage in California do not have standing to appeal a lower-court ruling that overturned it. This effectively gives the green light for same-sex weddings to proceed in California, the most populous state in the country. We're joined by Stuart Gaffney and John Lewis, two of the plaintiffs in the California marriage cases that established the freedom to marry before Prop 8 went into effect. They have been together for 26 years and married in 2008 before Prop 8 passed. Both work at Marriage Equality USA : Gaffney is the media director, and Lewis is the legal director. \"The reality is that the Supreme Court has moved forward the law in a tremendous way with these two cases decided yesterday, but it's also moved forward the dialogue,\" Gaffney says.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: In a resounding victory for marriage equality, the Supreme Court ruled that married same-sex couples were entitled to federal benefits, as it struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. In addition, the court paved the way for same-sex marriages to resume in California. When the five-to-four decision on DOMA was announced, an enormous cheer went up outside the courtroom, and the crowd started chanting, \" DOMA is dead!\" as couples hugged and cried.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the case was an 84-year-old lesbian named Edith Windsor. She sued the federal government after she was forced to pay additional estate taxes because it did not recognize her marriage to her wife, Thea Spyer. At a press conference, Windsor reacted to the ruling.\n\nEDITH WINDSOR : All you guys now know that the Supreme Court has announced its decision in Windsor v. The United States . And we won everything we asked and hoped for. Wow. I'm honored and humbled and overjoyed to be here today to represent not only the thousands of Americans whose lives-whose lives have been adversely impacted by the Defense of Marriage Act, but those whose hopes and dreams have been constricted by the same discriminatory law. Children born today will grow up in a world without DOMA , and those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married as Thea and I did, but with the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else. If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it. And she would be so pleased.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Edith Windsor. In his majority opinion in the DOMA case, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, quote, \"The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity. By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute is in violation of the Fifth Amendment,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in his dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, quote, \"Even setting aside traditional moral disapproval of same-sex marriage (or indeed same-sex sex), there are many perfectly valid-indeed, downright boring-justifying rationales for this legislation.\"\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Minutes after DOMA was struck down, the Supreme Court declared another victory for same-sex couples. The court announced supporters of the ban on same-sex marriage in California did not have standing to appeal a lower-court ruling that overturned the Proposition 8 ban. This effectively gives the green light for same-sex weddings to proceed in California, the most populous state in the nation. Plaintiffs in the case reacted joyfully to the verdict. This is Kris Perry, Jeffrey Zarrillo and Paul Katami.\n\nKRIS PERRY : Today is a great day for American children and families. Sandy and I want to say how happy we are, not only to be able to return to California and finally get married, but to be able to say to the children in California, \"No matter where you live, no matter who your parents are, no matter what family you're in, you are equal, you are as good as your friends' parents and as your friends.\" We believe, from the very beginning, that the importance of this case was to send a message to the children of this country that you are just as good as everybody else, no matter who you love, no matter who your parents love.\n\nJEFFREY ZARRILLO : Today, the court said that I am more equal, that we are more equal, our love is just like our parents' and our grandparents', and that any children that we may have in the future will be more secure.\n\nPAUL KATAMI : So, today is a good day. It's the day I finally get to look at the man that I love and finally say, \"Will you please marry me?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, for more, we go to San Francisco, where we're joined by Stuart Gaffney and John Lewis. They were two of the plaintiffs in the California marriage cases that established the freedom to marry before Prop 8 went into effect. They were married, surrounded by friends and family, June of 2008, on the first full day that marriages were legalized in California. Both work at Marriage Equality USA . Stuart's the media director, and John is the legal director.\n\nStuart Gaffney and John Lewis, welcome to Democracy Now! Stuart, your response to what happened? Because after you were married, well, there was a ban placed on marriages in California-until, well, yesterday, when it looks like they will soon resume.\n\nSTUART GAFFNEY : You know, this is a sweet moment. Those of us married in 2008, before the passage of Proposition 8-and there are 18,000 couples just like us-we're all celebrating our five-year anniversaries right now. And what an anniversary gift we have just received from the U.S. Supreme Court to know that now we're not just the class of 2008, this sort of footnote in the history of marriage equality in this country, but instead we're the beginning of an era that now continues of the freedom to marry in California, thanks to this decision yesterday. It's really a happy day not just for the rights of all fair-minded Americans, but also for our friends who have been waiting for as long as five years to finally be able to legally say, \"I do.\" You showed us the joy from the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I can tell you that in San Francisco City Hall, the joy was that much or even greater as we looked around and saw our friends begin to plan their wedding day.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: John Lewis, if you can, take us through the first court decision on DOMA , because the court did basically allow states that continue to ban same-sex marriages to do so. Could you talk about what the import will be across the country, both in states that currently ban same-sex marriage and those that don't?\n\nJOHN LEWIS : Well, what I thought was bone-striking about both DOMA decision was how much the court talked about the dignity and respect that should be due loving, committed same-sex couples. And in that case, they were talking about couples who are legally married already. And they said that this so-called Defense of Marriage Act, which injures loving, committed same-sex couples, that it demeans their dignity and that it is a humiliation for their children. So, in these terms that the court talked about, about how important laws that hurt lesbian and gay people are to our basic humanity, I think this case is going to serve as a very important precedent as the movement continues, with of course the eventual goal of having a ruling from the United States Supreme Court that says every American, regardless of who you are, who you love, that you have a fundamental right to marry in whatever state you live in this nation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Justice Antonin Scalia used his dissent in DOMA to rail against the court's 2003 decision in the Lawrence v. Texas case that struck down the sodomy law in Texas. Scalia wrote, quote, \"When the Court declared a constitutional right to homosexual sodomy, we were assured [that] the case had nothing, nothing at all to do with 'whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.' [unquote] Now we are told [that] DOMA is invalid because it 'demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects,' with an accompanying citation of Lawrence ,\" he wrote. What exactly does this mean, John?\n\nJOHN LEWIS : Well, I think Justice Scalia mischaracterizes these cases. For hundreds of years now, the United States Supreme Court has built case law based on precedent. And what Lawrence did was it recognized that laws that actually criminalize the physical expression of love between two people of the same gender, they violate the Constitution, because the physical relationship between two people of the same gender is indicative of a relationship of an emotional bond that is far deeper. And what the court did today was it built upon that precedent, and it applied Lawrence to our loving, committed same-sex couples' marriages. And so, it was building on precedent just like the Supreme Court does today. And that's exactly what we expect the Supreme Court to do. I would note Justice Scalia is in dissent. A majority of the Supreme Court believes that laws that openly discriminate against same-sex couples, under the federal laws, they do violate the constitutional rights of lesbian and gay people.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I want to turn to a clip from an interview by conservative radio show host Glenn Beck. He was interviewing Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky following Wednesday's Supreme Court decisions. Glenn Beck speaks first.\n\nGLENN BECK : I am very concerned. I don't-I mean, I really don't care. You get married, you don't get married. You-you, you know, have homosexual marriage or whatever. First problem with this is if you change one variable-man and a woman to man and man and woman and woman-you cannot then tell me that you can't logically change the other variable-one man, three women; one woman, four men. You can't do that. And who are you to say that if I am a devout Muslim and I come over here and I have three wives-who are you to say, if I'm an American citizen, that I can't have multiple marriages?\n\nSEN . RAND PAUL : Right.\n\nGLENN BECK : I mean-\n\nSEN . RAND PAUL : And I think this is a conundrum and gets back to what you were saying in the opening, whether or not churches should decide this. But it is difficult, because if we have no laws on this, people take it to one extension further: Does it have to be humans? You know, I mean, so there really are-the question is: What social mores-can some social mores be part of legislation? Historically, we did at the state legislative level. We did allow for some social mores to be part of it. Some of them were said to be for health reasons and otherwise. But I'm kind of with you. I see the thousands-of-year tradition of the nucleus of the family unit. I also see that, economically, if you just look without any kind of moral periscope and you say, \"What is it that is a leading cause of poverty in our country?\" it's having kids without marriage. The stability of the marriage unit is enormous, and we should not just say, \"Oh, we're punting on it, and marriage can be anything.\"\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Stuart Gaffney, your response to them raising the possibility, one, that this opens the floodgates for polygamy as well as the disintegration of the family?\n\nSTUART GAFFNEY : Well, it was interesting to hear it characterized in that clip as a \"conundrum.\" I think it would be more appropriate to say it's a fallacy and a red herring. We're talking about marriage, which is a loving commitment between two people. And that is the same argument that was used against couples like my own mom and dad, an interracial couple, who faced over a third of the states barring their marriage a generation ago when they sought to legally marry. When those lawsuits were brought that finally overturned state laws banning interracial marriage and making my family legal in all 50 states, we heard exactly these same sorts of arguments about \"What about polygamy?\" and also \"What about the children?\"\n\nAnd the reality is that the Supreme Court has moved forward the law in a tremendous way with these two cases decided yesterday, but it's also moved forward the dialogue. In the oral argument, Justice Kennedy asked, \"What about the children?\" But he asked about it on the-emphasizing the importance of the freedom to marry. He said, \"In California, there are 40,000 kids being raised by same-sex couples. What about their rights? Aren't their voices critical to this case?\" And we saw in the decision that it's not just right in the matter of law, but it's right as a matter of love and, again, the love between two people. So, just as making my parents' marriage legal in all 50 states didn't lead to polygamy, making our marriage legal only resulted in my mom and dad being able to witness our wedding day, which was, for all of us, was one of the happiest days of our lives.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, it's interesting you raise this, Stuart, in your own family background, because on the one hand you have this major human rights advance, the Supreme Court decisions yesterday, but the day before, the scuttling of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, such an incredible step backward for-for so many people in this country.\n\nSTUART GAFFNEY : You know, we are very mindful, as we celebrate the good news in these two marriage cases, of how much work remains to be done. And so, as we were part of a joyous celebration in the streets of San Francisco-and similar celebrations were held in over 75 cities all around the U.S. yesterday-we thought, \"This is good news. We should mark this as a landmark day for our community and for all fair-minded Americans. And then tomorrow we should roll up our sleeves and get back to work.\" There's clearly more work to be done.\n\nAlso, people have sometimes said, \"Aren't you actually a little bit disappointed in some of these rulings? That why don't we have a 50-state solution coming out of the Supreme Court?\" I think the reality-and, as you're pointing out-is, this is actually the best we could have gotten out of these particular nine justices. Of all the scenarios that were likely to be able to get us five votes from this court, this was the best possible outcome, which is why we're seeing so much joy in our community, as we now plan our next steps.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I want to ask about a piece by Kevin Drum of Mother Jones , an article yesterday titled \"The Big Problem With the Supreme Court's Prop. 8 Decision.\" He wrote, quote, \"With today's decision, the Supreme Court is basically gutting the people's right to pass initiatives that elected officials don't like and then to defend them all the way to the highest court in the land.\n\n\"To me, this has neither the flavor of justice nor of democratic governance, regardless of whether I like the outcome.\" John, I'm wondering if you could respond to that?\n\nJOHN LEWIS : Yeah, well, the jurisdictional and standing questions before the Supreme Court in the Prop 8 case were actually quite complex, and they cut various ways. I think what is most interesting and important about the case, the Prop 8 case, is that there is a fundamental principle of federal jurisdiction that you cannot continue an appeal, you cannot pursue a lawsuit on and on, if you are not actually personally injured by the law. And something that is just a bedrock truth of the freedom to marry movement is that, as you can see, it's of enormous benefit to the loving, committed same-sex couples who are directly affected, while it has absolutely no effect on anybody else's marriage or anybody else. And that was the problem that the backers of Proposition 8 had. Allowing the freedom to marry in California just does not affect them. And because of that, they didn't have a personal injury that they could then continue this litigation. And that's why the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and let stand the 136-page district court opinion that, point by point by point, addressed the evidence after a two-week trial and found that Proposition 8's exclusion of loving, committed same-sex couples from marriage violates our most basic freedom, fairness and equality guarantees in our Constitution.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : John Lewis and Stuart Gaffney, I want to thank you very much for being with us. They've been a loving, committed couple for 26 years, two of the plaintiffs in the California marriage cases that established the freedom to marry before Prop 8 went into effect. They were married, surrounded by friends and family, in June of 2008 on the first full day marriages were legalized in California. When Prop 8 passed, other same-sex couples were denied the right to marry. The backers of Prop 8 tried to retroactively invalidate their marriage, too, but the California Supreme Court ruled that those marriages still stood. Both John and Stuart work at the grassroots organization Marriage Equality, Stuart the media director, John the legal director. Congratulations to you both.\n\nThis is Democracy Now!

I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we turn to Part 2 of our conversation with Ben Jealous, former president of the NAACP , then president of People for the American Way, just about to be executive director of the Sierra Club. He's currently professor of practice at the University of Pennsylvania. And he ran for governor of Maryland. Well, Ben Jealous is out with a memoir today. It's called Never Forget Our People Were Always Free: A Parable of American Healing .\n\nWhen Ben was president of the NAACP in 2011, we spoke on the grounds of the Georgia prison where Troy Anthony Davis was being executed. Ben Jealous was protesting outside.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Those of us who knew Troy Davis, who sat with him, who talked to him, know that he was somebody who was full of love, full of love for his family, full of love for humanity, full of love for a movement that he was born into, a movement for civil and human rights in this country, somebody who said, \"This movement started before I died. No matter what happens on the 21st, it must grow stronger.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Ben Jealous speaking just after Troy Anthony Davis was executed in 2011. His new memoir, out today, Never Forget Our People Were Always Free: A Parable of American Healing .\n\nBen, thank you so much for staying with us for Part 2 of this conversation. I want to start off by asking you about your title, Never Forget Our People Were Always Free , how you chose it, and then the kind of issues you take on, but in this book, talking in each case about what gives you hope - unlikely people across the political spectrum actually working together.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : You know, Troy Davis's campaign was an example of that. I was on death row with him. We were surrounded by guards. We were sitting in the room where they let you bring your family and your friends. The guards were all around us. Troy was telling me his story for the first time. I had worked on his case for 15 years at that point, but I had never met him. And now I was meeting him with his sister and his nephew. And there were tears running down the guards' faces, because, you know, they see a lot of killers on death row, and they know what a killer looks like, and Troy wasn't one. And they knew that meant that if the Supreme Court didn't stop his execution, they would have to be his killer. They would be the ones to murder an innocent man. Their former warden had raised his voice trying to stop the execution. That's part of why he was the former warden. The governor got rid of him to keep it going. And, you know, when you're a prison guard, it's often because there's no other job to support your families. When you have real working-class white folks crying, you know, as death row guards because they're going to have to execute somebody - and it speaks to what's in my book, Never Forget Our People Were Always Free , that there's - you know, that our hearts pull us together.\n\nThe title came from my grandma. It was a riddle, Amy. She would say this, like, as a closer when we're talking about, for instance, the fact that we were products of rapes on plantations. And she'd say, \"Never forget our people were always free.\" It didn't make any sense. Three of her grandparents were born into slavery. I confronted her, and she kind of crumbled. And it was like if you said to a devout nun, like, \"Immaculate conception seems impossible. What else you got?\" Like, she just crumbled. It was an article of faith. And what I realized as I did the research for this book was that that saying was said by her grandmother, by her mother. It echoed down the maternal line. What we figured out, with the help of Henry Louis Gates Jr. at Harvard, was that my grandmother's maternal line in America begins with an Afro-Polynesian pirate, with a pirate kidnapped from Madagascar, a group of Afro-Polynesian pirates resisting an onslaught from European pirates. They lost the battle. They were captured and enslaved. And, well, what else would a pirate woman say to the children first born into slavery in her family, but \"Never forget our people were always free\"? It's the only point in our history in America and our family where that made sense. And for reasons I get into in the book, it was pretty clear that that's what was happening, that the women were repeating this down the line.\n\nThat was ultimately, you know, a rallying cry, a call to insurrection. It's what gave my grandmothers steel in their back. It explained, in my eyes, why all the women in that line were rebels. They ran away from slavery. They fought to, you know, protect children. My mom sued her high school when she was 12. All inspired by the first to be brought here, a woman who had been a pirate when she was free.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ben, I wanted to ask you - you're soon to be head of the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club has a checkered history when it comes to the issue of race and white supremacy. Many - unfortunately, several major national environmental groups do. But I'm wondering if you could talk about that a little bit, and what your expectations are in terms of - they've reckoned with it a couple of years ago, acknowledged that several of their founders, like Joseph LeConte and John Muir, were very much involved in or connected to white supremacist movements, at the same time that they were defending the environment and seeking to protect the planet. Wondering what your thoughts as you head into this new job.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : John Muir was somebody who wrestled with all this. You know, I grew up really appreciating him. I grew up - you know, my parents had fled Maryland. They raised me in Northern California. I grew up amongst the redwoods. I slept in the base of them as a kid. And I grew up knowing that John Muir, even as he, you know, made comments that were very typical for the late 19th century, and very problematic by today's standards, very problematic by a lot of standards, also carried Thoreau's papers with him and reading Thoreau's case for the abolition of slavery. He was a man who wrestled with the issues of the day.\n\nFundamentally, today's Sierra Club is the most inclusive, the largest, the biggest, the oldest, but also the most inclusive environmentalist organization in this country. And the staff there is phenomenally diverse, and all of their communities on fire to save our planet, to save our wild places. Juan, you know, as men of color, as communities of color, our poor people, of all colors, tend to grow up sort of more impacted by climate change, you know, in the bottoms, in the places most likely to flood, in the places that seem to always get hit by tornadoes. And so, I'm excited to lead that staff. I'm excited to lead this organization.\n\nSierra Club, at the end of the day, is a very American organization. And like our country, it's evolved a lot since the late 19th century and the men who led it then. But it's also true that those men also left great legacies, not just problematic ones. As, you know, citizens of this country, it's something we wrestle with all the time. And the great parts of the legacy, like Yosemite National Park and our national park system, are really incredible. And I'm proud to help keep that part of the legacy going.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben, as you talk about bridging the east and the west of this country, your parents forced out of Maryland because they were in an interracial marriage - it wasn't legal in Maryland; you then go to California - you talk about mass movements and working across the aisle, if you will, like working with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to tackle mass incarceration, or, following up on Troy Anthony Davis, so seminal in your life and in your work at the NAACP , your work to end the death penalty in this country, and for voting rights, when it comes to mass incarceration, for those who come out of prison. Talk - give us some specific examples of what has happened, and where you see progress and where you don't.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Sure. You know, well, right after Troy Davis was executed, we were able to abolish the death penalty in a state south of the Mason-Dixon for the first time, Maryland, and then it would happen in Virginia. And we did that with the help of Republicans, like then-Lieutenant Governor Mike Steele. Down in Georgia, Stacey Abrams and I got together with Governor Nathan Deal, a tea party governor, and decided the one thing we could all agree on was that Georgia's prison system was too big. And actually, we figured out there was another thing, which was we needed to send people who were addicts to rehab, not to prison. His son, Nathan Deal's son, was a drug court judge. And we got that done, shrinking one of the - shrinking the fourth-largest prison system in the state. We would do similar things in Texas. Working with the tea party there through the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition, the NAACP helped get Rick Perry to sign 50 progressive criminal justice reform bills for the first time in history in - for the first time in the history of Texas, shutting down prisons. They had never done that before.\n\nBut Virginia was probably the most remarkable conversation in many ways. Tim Kaine was on his way from being governor of Virginia as a Democrat to being chairman of the DNC . And I called him. It was kind of the season of clemency at the end of his term as governor. And I asked him to simply issue a pardon to formerly incarcerated people - white, Black, Brown, Asian, Native American - across the state, restoring their voting rights once they had served their time - Virginia, one of only two states with a lifetime ban on formerly incarcerated people voting. And he flatly refused.\n\nSo I said, \"What the heck? I'll just call his successor.\" So, then in comes a Republican conservative attorney general to be the governor, Bob McDonnell. And I go and I sit down with him, and I ask him to do the same thing. And he looks at me. He says, \"Why don't we try to get the Legislature to do it first. And if not, I'll use my executive powers.\" And that's what he did. And he literally became the first governor.\n\nYou know, Tim Kaine, it was kind of in his political interest, arguably. There are a lot of whites and Blacks in prison, but more Blacks than whites in Virginia, and they tend to vote Democrat. So, Tim Kaine could profit. Bob McDonnell had no political profit. He simply thought it was the right thing to do. He believed in a right to redemption. He and I both now sit on the Racial Reconciliation Commission for the state.\n\nWe need politicians to have courage. Tim Kaine, ironically, started his career as a civil rights lawyer. He knew it was the right thing to do. Dr. King, in his \"Letter from Birmingham Jail,\" was quite damning of moderates who know what the right thing is, but refuse to do it. Bob McDonnell showed courage. And in the end of the day, that's what we need.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And to follow up on that, Ben, in terms of courage, we've got a record number of progressive Democrats in Congress, and yet we are still seeing the Congress passing record levels of military and war spending. And unfortunately, a lot of those progressives, even a guy that you worked with closely, Bernie Sanders, have not really stood out in terms of trying to oppose this kind of spending, or at least not thrown down the gauntlet on it. I'm wondering your concerns about the continued military spending by the United States to the detriment of the domestic spending that is so required.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : I was having a conversation with a vet the other day, a former active-duty U.S. marine, about Camp Lejeune and the dirty water there. And there's now been a lot of lawsuits and settlements. And what we were talking about was our shared pain that all this money goes into the military, and yet they shortchange the soldiers and the vets all the time. The money that goes in the military disproportionately goes right out in the hands of profiteers, you know, the military-industrial complex, companies that are building new weapons systems when the old ones work just fine. But it doesn't really make sure that the soldiers and the sailors and the marines even get clean drinking water, or that they get paid well enough to really support their families.\n\nAnd so, that's the thing that we really, I think, need to reckon with as a country, is, one, we need to have a vision about what is our military for. It should be for defense. We're involved in far too much offense. And that tends to kill empires, as you know. I mean, you look at why the Soviet Union failed and why did Rome fall. Two things: overspending on incarceration at home, incarcerating too much of your domestic population, and overspending on domestic - on entanglements abroad, on wars overseas. We need to get back to really seeing our military as a tool for defense. And we need to make sure that we're, frankly, spending less, and the money that we spend, really make sure that our - first and foremost, that our soldiers, our sailors, our marines are treated well, our vets are treated well. General Eisenhower warned us about this. He warned us about the lobbyists from the defense companies. And they are run amok in Washington, and it's impoverishing our country. And if you look at old empires, it also, frankly, seems to be one of the big things that could spell our demise. We need to take it quite seriously.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Jealous, you - the power of your memoir are your stories, your personal stories with your family, as well as the stories of people you've met, like forging an unlikely friendship in rural Mississippi with an elderly white man who helped stop the state from turning a historically Black college into a prison. Can you tell us that story, and also the story of listening with Stacey Abrams to the son of a former Klansman?\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Yes. You know, Stacey and I met in Mississippi on that campaign. And in that campaign, the governor, Fordice, who was like a prototype for Trump, quite literally - same background, businessman, racist talk, you know, kind of a whack job, to be honest - he came into office, and he literally said, in response to a Supreme Court judgment that the state eradicate its dual system of higher education, rather than, \"Well, we'll let everybody into all the schools,\" he said, \"We'll just shut down the historically Black colleges, and we'll raise the requirements to get into any of our universities,\" that would exclude about 80% of the Black students and a lot of the white students. And so, there we were fighting. And then, they said to him, \"Well, what are you going to do with these colleges?\" He says, \"Oh, we'll shut down that one. We'll make that one majority white. And the third one, Mississippi Valley State, we'll make that a prison.\"\n\nAnd it was - Earth Day was coming up. And we decided that was our best chance to find our white allies in the state. So we found out - we fanned out organizers. And then, one set of the organizers - you know, all of them reported things went well, except for one, and they were late getting home. And we all met up at a Waffle House about 2:00 in the morning. They had gone up to Mississippi State University. They had asked for help at Earth Day to save the Black colleges. But it was - they didn't let them speak during the Earth Day rally. They waited for it to become a keg party after. And after the third encore of \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" they put them on stage. They asked for help. And the crowd started chanting, \"Get a rope. Get a rope. Get a rope.\" And so, these young men, our young organizers, said, \"You know, we did that crazy two-step. We didn't want to run, because we didn't want them to chase us. But we had to get off campus as quick as possible.\"\n\nAnd there we were in Jackson figuring it out, and an old white man was staring at us. And in Mississippi, for 100 bucks back then and no felonies, you could carry a concealed firearm wherever you wanted to go. And we didn't know if he had one. And when he walked over to our table still frowning, he just - you know, he ultimately put out his hand. And he said, \"I'm so proud of you boys.\" He was calling us \"boy.\" We didn't like that. But he seemed sincere. He said, \"If I was born\" - he used a curse word. He said, \"But if I was born Black in this state, I'd be mad as heck, too.\" And he offered to help.\n\nAnd that changed my whole style of organizing in that moment. You know, we were afraid of him. We didn't know if we needed to physically restrain him. We didn't know if he had a gun. Some other white folks just threatened to kill our organizers. And yet, he was walking and speaking out of his heart. He had taken a moment to think about what it was like to be Black in Mississippi and how outrageous it was. They wanted to turn a college into a prison. He signed up for the march. He donated. He showed up. And ultimately, so did hundreds of other white people, to a march of about 15,000 people. But it was enough to send a signal that Mississippi would come together on this. Those colleges still exist. Those colleges got more funding because of that courage. And it connected Stacey Abrams and I for life.\n\nAnd fast-forward, I'm president of the NAACP , Amy and Juan, and we're down at the Moore's Ford Bridge. It was the last horrific lynching in Georgia's history. People still get lynched, but now it's quiet. A corpse will be found hanging in a forest. But back then, everybody in town was there. And then, yet, when the FBI would show up the next day, or, you know, the feds would show up the next day, nobody remembered anything. In Moore's Ford, they literally cut a baby from the womb of a woman tied to a tree. They stopped two Black couples driving on the road. They ripped them out of their cars. They tied them to trees. They killed them. They burned them. But first they removed a fetus from the belly of one of the women. And I was sitting in a church. I had come to interview the nephew of two of the - the nephew and son of two of the lynchers, who had been burdened with hearing the firsthand accounts of his father and his uncle right after and them celebrating their savage torture and execution of these Black couples. And he was literally dissembling, Amy and Juan, right in front of us as he told their story.\n\nAnd I was grateful for Stacey that day. She had come to witness it and to talk about her strategy for building a movement in the state. And she had also come as the aunt, if you will, the adopted aunt to my 7-year-old daughter. And she literally brought her a DVD with a little screen and some headphones and just put them over her ears, because she didn't want her to be burdened as a 7-year-old the way that that man was burdened when he was 7. She knew it would be too much for my daughter to hear. So my daughter watched The Nutty Professor while Stacey and I took notes.\n\nAnd I sent the video right to the DOJ , because we're still trying to close these cases, and we're still trying to make sure that anybody is brought to justice, but, most importantly, because most of the people are dead now, that the truth is known. And it was great to watch that man walk out of that church. He literally stood up straighter. He had been burdened his entire life almost with that story. And just having told the truth to people who would do something about it, you could see that he was - he would be able to live a life with kind of less burden and greater dignity.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Ben, I wanted to ask you a little bit about politics. I mean, obviously, you ran for governor of Maryland. You were - you endorsed Bernie Sanders and were a major national surrogate for his presidential campaign. We're heading into another presidential campaign, and the Democrats are going to have to decide whether some of them are going to run in a primary against Joe Biden, if Biden decides to run. Your sense of what the Democratic Party should be looking for, and progressives or radicals should be looking for, in terms of the next presidential race?\n\nBEN JEALOUS : We need to put forward a candidate who it is clear really stands with the people, who's willing to stand up to corporations, who can unite this country. I believe those folks exist. A lot of them are young. You know, if Joe Biden runs, I'll support him, because, quite frankly, there's a lot of power in incumbency, and right now he looks like the best shot. If he doesn't run, I think the party really needs to look to its younger bench. It's got to look to people who can pull people together.\n\nWes Moore just won overwhelmingly. Third time's the charm. You know, three Black men have run for governor in Maryland - I was the second - in a row. And Wes won. Anthony Brown and I sat down with him to coach him on how to get through it, and he did it. He's a vet. He's the type of person, I think, who has a profile that can pull folks together in this moment. There are others like that in the party.\n\nWe need to look for people who can pull folks together. And this is a populist moment in this country. The people are, frankly, too poor to want to feel like they're dealing with a candidate who's bought and, you know, who's a wholly owned subsidiary of corporations. We've got to have people who will fight for the people - we've got to have politicians who will fight for the people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Ben, in your book, you talk about the link between people and what looks like different sides of the political spectrum is class, and that's really what unites people, especially working people in this country. Give us some examples of that. And if you can end on talking about an issue which was - is one of the most critical issues in your life, the death penalty, what it means, as we used to talk, when you were head of the NAACP , about getting it banned in this country, the only country in the industrialized world to have the death penalty, making it cruel and unusual? What, half the states voting against it could then overturn it with a court decision. If you can talk about those things?\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Sure. You know, when you walk into a death row, when you walk into a prison, what you realize really right away are two things. One, you're like, \"Wow! There's a lot of white people here,\" because our media really only shows us images of Black folks who are being convicted for serious crimes. They don't show you the white images. You know, our media shows us pretty much only images of Black and Brown poor people, even though the biggest group of poor has always been white people. And so, you look around, it's a little bit disorienting compared to what you've seen in the media. And then it settles in, and you realize, \"Oh, what 95% of these people have in common is that they grew up poor. They were too poor to afford a lawyer.\" And then you listen to them, as I have, on death rows and in prisons - white, Black, Brown, Native American, Asian American - and their lives are actually pretty similar.\n\nAnd so, you know, we - when I was researching Never Forget Our People Were Always Free , what really blew me away was figuring out that my grandmother's grandfather - you know, she had been inspired by her grandfather the way I was inspired by her. And my grandmother was a great anti-poverty crusader, even more than campaigning for racial justice. Her most famous protégé, Senator Barbara Mikulski, who she trained as a social worker. And what I discovered was that she inherited that fight against poverty from her grandfather.\n\nHer grandfather had - was the leader of the Black Republicans, which was then the radical progressive group in Virginia, in the early 1880s, in the little gap between the end of Reconstruction and the start of Jim Crow. And the plantation class was ascending, because they had been reenfranchised by the Hayes-Tilden Compromise in 1876. And they were boldly stating, \"There is no way we can afford to pay the Civil War debt and these free - and pay for these free public schools that the Reconstruction government started. So we're going to shut down the free public schools.\" And working-class whites left the Democratic Party, which back then was the conservative party, in droves, started a new party called the Readjusters, their leader a former Confederate general and railroad magnate named William B. Mahone, who had decided, rather than suppressing a populist uprising, to join it, because he figured it would benefit Southern railroads, and he also agreed with the cause of the soldiers he used to lead.\n\nMy grandmother's grandfather, Edward David Bland, looked at William Mahone, and he recognized him. William Mahone was a notorious man thought to be a war criminal by Blacks in southern Virginia because of the Battle of the Crater. When a Black regiment surrendered, he massacred all of them. But this was 15 years after the war, and it was five years into the reign of terror of the Ku Klux Klan. And these two men joined together. And they brought former Confederates, and they brought enslaved men together, and they built the biggest party in the state. They took over the governorship. They took over both U.S. Senate seats. They took over both houses of the Legislature. And they built a movement whose legacy endures to this day. They were violently repressed. Six people were assassinated during their reelection bid. Horrible disinformation that spawned violence, like we saw in Buffalo last summer, was down in Danville, Virginia, where Blacks were killed in the square because of lies put out in pamphlets saying that they were raping white women, which was not happening. And then they were erased from the history books. I mean, think about it. Did anybody ever teach you that former Confederates and former slaves got together to save public school systems in Virginia, let alone several states, as they did?\n\nAnd so, what that really confirmed for me was that you could just keep going back through American history and seeing whites and Blacks and Brown people, Native Americans, Asian Americans, coming together in the interests of their children. Literally, in Virginia, it happened in 1663, 300 years before the March on Washington. It kept happening.\n\nBut what it taught me about race, Amy and Juan, is this, that even sort of upstream from racism is greed. You have to ask yourself: Why would America, a hundred years after the American experiment started in 1619, why would America, in like, say, the 1720s, change the definition of \"race\"? The definition had been constant for half a millennia. You have to go back to the 1100s in Italy to find where the word comes into the European language. It starts as \" razza \" in Italian. And every variation of that means the same thing: genus, type, or, when applied to people, tribe or nation, people bound by geography. And here, America creates a new definition: race as a color caste system, superhuman at top, subhuman at bottom, the whitest of white at the top, the blackest of black at the bottom. Why would America do that? And the answer quickly becomes: because it profited the king, because it profited the colonial lords. They had tried to stop indentured Europeans and enslaved Africans from coming together, and they were failing. Using the military didn't quite do it. Using new laws didn't quite do it. So they reach for culture, and they change the definition of a word. And they start to teach whites that you are inherently superior to Blacks as a way to separate the two groups.\n\nThis is what Dr. King was assassinated trying to teach us, that at the end of the day, the impact of racism in America, the biggest, broadest impact, is it keeps millions of people of all color trapped in poverty, because it divides them, it splits them, and it eviscerates the power that they would have. He was organizing a Poor People's Campaign, trying to change that, when he was assassinated.\n\nThat is the work of this country. If we're really going to achieve the promise of this country, we've got to come across the old lines, come together in the interests of all of our children. And what my family history taught me when I was researching Never Forget Our People Were Always Free was that Confederate soldiers and formerly enslaved men once did that in Virginia, and it saved the public schools, and it abolished the poll tax, it abolished the whipping post, it built two great public universities, and it laid the seeds for the FDR New Deal coalition. If they can do it, we can do it. So let's go get it done.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Jealous, former president of the NAACP , then head of People for the American Way, currently professor of practice at University of Pennsylvania, and now author of a new book, out today, Never Forget Our People Were Always Free: A Parable of American Healing .

Aid agencies estimate as many as one million people may be without shelter. The storm hit Burma on Friday night. For over ten hours, winds traveling up to 150 miles per hour struck Burma's largest city, Rangoon. More than twenty inches of rain were dumped on the city. Satellite images from NASA show virtually the entire coastal plain of Burma under water. It was the largest cyclone to hit Asia since 1991, when 143,000 people died in Bangladesh. On Monday, Burma's military junta said it would allow some foreign aid groups to enter the country. Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith offered assistance.\n\nStephen Smith : \"Whilst we have very grave difficulties with the regime in Burma, we have over the period been continuing to render modest humanitarian assistance directly to the people of Burma. So we stand ready, willing and able to assist in conjunction with the United Nations and the relevant agencies.\"\n\nIn the United States, voters head to the polls today in North Carolina and Indiana for two closely contested primary races between Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. At a campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, Senator Clinton said she is best suited to win in November.\n\nSen. Clinton : \"I believe that I would be the best president and the stronger candidate against Senator McCain, and ultimately this is about getting to 270 electoral votes. If the Democratic Party had the same rules as the Republican Party, I would already be the nominee.\"\n\nDespite a series of recent setbacks, Senator Obama said he still expects to win the nomination.\n\nSen. Obama : \"Obviously, we're focusing right now on Indiana and North Carolina. I don't like to get too far ahead of myself. That's why I think we've done well, is we campaigned state by state. But I'm confident that I will win this nomination, and I am confident that when I square off with John McCain that we're going to have a serious debate about where this country needs to go.\"\n\nThe New York Times is coming under criticism for publishing an article based solely on unnamed sources suggesting that the Lebanese group Hezbollah is training Iraqi militants inside Iran. The article by Michael Gordon was published on Monday, one day after Iraqi government spokesperson Ali al-Dabbagh said Iraq has no hard evidence of Iranian support of insurgents in Iraq. John Stauber of PR Watch said Gordon's article is \"reminiscent of the horrendous errors of judgment and bad journalism committed by Michael Gordon, Judith Miller and others at the New York Times who turned the paper into a conduit for phony stories that sold the war in Iraq.\" Retired Air Force Colonel Sam Gardiner said he feels the article in Monday's Times is \"part of a strategic communications plan.\"\n\nHours after the Times article was published, former UN Ambassador John Bolton appeared on Fox News and called for US strikes against Iran. He was interviewed by Jaime Colby of Fox News.\n\nJohn Bolton : \"I think this is a case where the use of military force against a training camp to show the Iranians we're simply not going to tolerate this is really the most prudent thing to do. And then the ball would be in Iran's court to draw the appropriate lesson to stop harming our troops.\"\n\nJaime Colby : \"Ambassador John Bolton, a good message to end on. Thank you very much.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Iran has reportedly suspended talks with the United States to discuss Iraqi security. According to the New York Times , Iran called off the talks to protest the ongoing US offensive against Shiite Iraqis in Baghdad.\n\nThe US government's top psychiatric researcher estimates the number of suicides among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan may exceed the combat death toll of the wars because of inadequate mental healthcare. Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, said community mental health centers have failed in providing adequate care to veterans. A recent study by the RAND Corporation determined that 20 percent of returning US soldiers have post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, and only half of them receive treatment. The House Veterans Affairs Committee is holding a hearing this morning on the issue of veteran suicides. Steve Rathbun from the University of Georgia will be testifying. According to his research, as many as 120 veterans are committing suicide every week.\n\nA top adviser to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has urged the United States and other nations to overhaul its system for sending food aid to countries in need. Professor Jeffrey Sachs said countries should be given resources to help grow their own food.\n\nJeffrey Sachs : \"If you help them to grow more food rather than shipping food aid, you'll produce an escape from poverty. If you ship food aid, you'll meet one-fifth of the food needs, people will suffer, it will be very expensive, and you'll do nothing to help them get out of poverty\"\n\nJeffrey Sachs also said the United States and Europe should cut back on production of biofuels.\n\nJeffrey Sachs : \"The second thing I believe we need is to cut back significantly on our biofuels programs, which were understandable at a time of much lower food prices and larger food stocks but do not make sense now in a global food scarcity condition. In the United States, as much as one-third of the maize crop this year will go to the gas tank, and this is a huge blow to the world food supply.\"\n\nAn Iraqi man has sued two US military contractors, claiming he was repeatedly tortured while being held at the Abu Ghraib prison. In the lawsuit, Emad al-Janabi says employees of CACI International and L-3 Communications punched him, slammed him into walls, hung him from a bed frame and kept him naked and handcuffed in his cell.\n\nGeorgia is set to execute William Earl Lynd tonight. He will become the first US prisoner to be put to death since the Supreme Court ended a de facto seven-month moratorium on capital punishment. Anti-death penalty campaigners have planned protests outside the prison and in five cities across the state. Since the Supreme Court ruling three weeks ago, states have scheduled at least fourteen more executions to take place over the next six months.\n\nMeanwhile, in North Carolina, an innocent man has been released after spending fourteen years on death row. Levon \"Bo\" Jones is the fifth death row prisoner to be exonerated in the United States in the past eleven months.\n\nA new book on Mumia Abu-Jamal asserts the former Black Panther and journalist did not kill Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. In his book The Framing of Mumia Abu-Jamal , J. Patrick O'Connor concludes the actual killer was Kenneth Freeman, a business partner of Mumia's brother. Freeman died in 1985.\n\nIn other prison news, a coalition of groups in California are filing a lawsuit today to stop the state from borrowing $12 billion to build 53,000 new prison beds. The expansion is considered the largest prison construction in US history. California has opened twenty-three new prisons in the past twenty-three years. Leading the opposition to the prison funding is the group Californians United for a Responsible Budget.\n\nAnd Mildred Loving has died at the age of sixty-eight. She and her husband made national headlines four decades ago when they successfully challenged Virginia's ban on interracial marriage.

      "text": "What It's Like To Be The First Woman In My Family To Choose An Interracial Marriage\n\nSenior Editor, HuffPost Personal\n\nGrowing up, my dad would repeat his house rule almost every week: When you get married, marry a Sikh.\n\nHe couldn't fathom that after moving to America for more opportunities for his family, one of his kids would make the mistake of losing touch with her roots. Through my mid-20s, my parents were still holding out hope that I would end up with a Sikh man.\n\nSikhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world, originating in Punjab, India. Its central values include the devotion to one God, service, equality, fighting for justice and truthful living. My parents are strict followers of the religion and made sure my siblings and I grew up going to Sikh camps over the summer, learning the Punjabi language and attending our version of Sunday school to learn hymns and history lessons.\n\nI've always identified as a Sikh, but it's been hard to reconcile my identity in my dating life. Before I met my husband, Sam, I dated both Sikh and non-Sikh men. Honestly, I often struggled when I went on dates with Sikh men. In some cases, I either felt too American and like I couldn't relate or match their cultural experiences, or I was forcing myself to overlook a lack of chemistry or connection to make it work just because they were Sikh. In other cases, c onversations about relational and marital expectations laid bare an underlying double standard of how it was only OK for men to grow up in this country and become liberal, opinionated, career-driven people.\n\nWhen I met Sam on a dating site in 2016, I wasn't making a conscious decision to be with someone who wasn't Indian or Sikh. After years of heartbreak and a series of terrible dating experiences, I just wanted to meet a kind, respectful generous man. Sam's emotional intelligence immediately blew me away, and I learned quickly that he was very different from the men I had dated before.\n\nMarriage is the ultimate success for Indian daughters, and my parents had been worried about me for years. So, at 27, I decided to tell them I had met someone. It was supposed to be positive news. I was happy.\n\nMy parents couldn't really wrap their heads around me dating a non-Sikh man at first. They couldn't understand why I would make a relationship and potential marriage even harder by choosing someone so different from me. They were worried for my future, and t hey pretty much banked on it being something that would pass. Months later, my dad continued to hint at potential Sikh suitors he knew about in the community. No matter how hard it was to actively fight for my happiness, I knew I'd have to ride it out and prove to them this wasn't short-lived.\n\nThis was new for Sam, too. He also had never been with someone of a different race or culture. Someone whose religion is the thread that ties together their values, world views and beliefs. Someone whose culture emphasized family involvement even on personal matters. And while his family only cared that he was happy, Sam waited patiently and respectfully for mine to get on board.\n\n\"I know that by choosing each other, Sam and I may have chosen a tougher path to go down, but also by choosing each other, we have been able to grow together and so have our families.\"\n\nWe had only been dating for three months when Donald Trump got elected in 2016, and it was the moment I knew Sam and I would either be able to see this through or would have to break up. We had to talk about the elephant in the room: his privilege as a white man. Sam listened intently as I talked through my fears for the turban-wearing men in my family who live in the South, and my own identity crisis. He also owned his place in these ongoing issues, learning to be an ally who knows when to stand by and listen and when to stand up and speak out.\n\nI know if I were with a Sikh man, I wouldn't necessarily need to have emotionally laborious conversations about race, religion and politics. These differences are a part of what makes my relationship with Sam beautiful, though. All relationships require work and effort, patience and respect and healthy communication. But because Sam and I were forced to address our differences very early on, we've also been able to address other big needs and desires out of a partnership ― from money and family involvement to future religious involvement in our relationship to cultural traditions and potential children.\n\nIn fact, much of what made me fall for Sam were his values that are foundational in the Sikh religion and of great importance to my family: his generosity to the less fortunate, his respect and desire for community building, his kindness, his nonjudgmental nature and ability to treat everyone as equals.\n\nI know that by choosing each other, Sam and I may have chosen a tougher path to go down, but we have also been able to grow together and so have our families. There's been a steep learning curve for all of us. Sam and his loving, open-minded and open-hearted family have been able to break the stereotypes my family unfortunately had of white Americans. And I've been able to reconnect with where I come from and who I am by teaching my husband and in-laws about Sikhism and being an Indian in this country.\n\nIn May 2017, six months after I told my parents about Sam, I asked them to meet him. If they didn't approve, I would hear them out and consider ending it. Even though I wouldn't be able to pursue a partnership with someone my family didn't approve of, I've always known in my heart that my parents want the best for me and truly want me to be happy. I also knew that Sam was special and that when they met him, they'd slowly come around.\n\nAnd thankfully, they did. But after Sam proposed in March 2018, everything seemed to get more complicated. Nothing prepared us for how tough wedding planning was going to be over the last year. There are very specific things a groom or a groom's family are expected to do in a Sikh wedding and it was hard at first for my parents to compromise on certain traditions to make room for Sam's comfort and our American expectations of what our wedding should feel like ― that our wedding is for us, not just for our community.\n\nEventually, we were able to create a wedding weekend that upheld the important Sikh wedding traditions with added twists to make it intercultural (i.e., we had a Sikh ceremony followed by a reception in a brewery where Sam played the drums with his band). However, leading up to it, I had massive anxiety wondering if my Sikh community was going to potentially judge my in-laws or not accept them. I was also nervous about how overwhelmed Sam's family might be by the culture shock of this elaborately planned weekend.\n\nThe truth is, I underestimated everyone. In getting so caught up in what it means to marry outside my race and religion, I didn't give credit to the love that was flowing around our relationship. My family and family's friends were loving, patient and kind, embracing my in-laws as new members of the community. And my in-laws were enthusiastic, flexible and willing to learn, embracing my culture and tradition with open minds and hearts. I truly couldn't have asked for any more love or acceptance.\n\nI always have taken my ability to \"choose\" my life and partner for granted, when in reality, it's a privilege. During my Sikh wedding, my dad read the laavan from the scripture from the Guru Granth Sahib (our holy book), which meant he sat in front of us through the entire traditional ceremony. I couldn't make eye contact with him because I knew we were both processing a series of emotions and it felt like a breach of his privacy.\n\nAfter the fourth laav , or walk around the Guru Granth Sahib , Sam and I were officially husband and wife. I looked up and locked eyes with my dad, and immediately started bawling.\n\nIt was in that moment that I got so overwhelmed by his love for me, a love so much stronger than his own religious beliefs or expectations or needs. I was able to see clearly the weight of the sacrifices and compromises my dad has made through his life to get me to where I was ― sitting next to a man I was privileged enough to choose as my life partner ― with the support of the hundreds of people sitting behind us. Him leaving his family over 30 years ago is the reason I've been able to choose Sam as my own.\n\nAs such, I think I'll always feel a slight sense of guilt for not ending up with a Sikh man. I feel a sense of guilt for not fitting into the role of \"obedient, good Indian girl\" - for doing whatever it took to make my parents' lives easier after all they've done for me. I went against the grain and chose my happiness over my parents' expectations.\n\nI know my parents initially wanted me to marry a Sikh, but I also know they truly love and consider Sam like a son. Their acceptance of my partnership and effort to meet me where I am has relieved some of my guilt. I've gotten a happy ending, but I know not everyone is as lucky or as supported as I have been.\n\nI don't know what to expect from my marriage to Sam. I know that this is a journey we will venture on together, but I also know that there will always be personal challenges I have to face alone. I am constantly re-evaluating my identities and relearning what they mean for me.\n\nSam knows how important it is for me to stay connected to my roots. He doesn't stand by idly while I navigate my identity crises alone. Instead, he looks up gurdwaras, or Sikh temples , in places near where we are going to live. He takes Bhangra dance lessons. He throws in Punjabi words with my nephews where he can. He educates himself.\n\nA post shared by Sahaj Kaur Kohli (@sahajkohli) on Apr 29, 2019 at 7:45am PDT\n\nMy partner's race and religious beliefs don't affect my autonomy to explore my own. I am not betraying my family or culture by committing to a partnership that nurtures who I am, supports my experiences and urges my exploration in and out of it.\n\nEven though it's been almost two months since the wedding, I have yet to take off my choora - my bridal bracelets and a sign of being a newlywed - and I am starting to realize it may be out of defiance for what a Sikh, Punjabi wife is supposed to look like. I'm figuring it out as I go, and I'm on a path that hasn't been taken by anyone in my family before, but I know I'm not alone.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

The report analyzes the demographics and economics of those who \"marry in\" and \"marry out\" of their race. The reports notes an increase in the number of interracial marriages and an increase in support for such marriages.\n\nGender patterns were also noted in the report and there was great variance in this data. One particular statistic stood out for me. About 24 percent of all black male newlyweds in 2010 married outside of their race as compared to 9 percent of black females.\n\nWell into my adult years, despite the fact that I preached diversity, I held the belief that black men should marry black women and conversely, black women should marry black men. I never considered a white man as a potential mate simply because of race. Maybe it was because I feared that others would interpret my choice of a white partner as a statement about my weak or non-existent affiliation with blacks. I was actually listening to the voice of my own insecure black identity and the collective insecurity that as blacks we embraced from living in a racist society. Perhaps that is why there are always more black men marrying outside of their race than black women... but that is a topic for another post.\n\nA white male friend who challenged my belief on this topic caused me to pause and rethink this position. I reasoned that after a day of battling being \"the only one\" or \"one of a few\" all day I might not want to connect with my partner simply because he was white. He pointed out that it wouldn't be any different from the times when I wouldn't want to connect with my black partner simply because he was male or because of a personality characteristic.\n\nAnother white male friend also enlightened my racially inconsistent thinking. He noted that by ruling out white males simply because of race was as offensive as any other racially exclusive action. I could rule him out because of personality or other reasons, but to do so because of race was absurd.\n\nUltimately, when doing research on cross-racial friendships, I not only changed my position on interracial marriages, but became a advocate for those who crossed racial lines in marriage. We have much to learn from them. At the risk of oversimplifying the issue, I believe that interracial couples support us all in moving toward a shared American experience.\n\nIn my diversity-training sessions, we often progress toward an animated discussion about what the American experience is. All of our ancestors, except for those of Native American Indians, arrived in this country by boat -- the difference is in the kind of boat. Some were passenger ships, and some were slave ships. The American Dream, that anyone may be able to create a \"rags to riches\" success, has historically been a nightmare for some racial groups. Similarly, the \"bootstrap theory\" -- that anyone can succeed through diligence and hard work (\"pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps\") -- only applies to those who have boots and, more particularly, boots with straps. From this perspective, the historical background of our racial heritage frames our relationship to America, and thus dictates the kind of American experience one might have.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "5 Couples Get Honest About Being In A Mixed Race Marriage In 2017\n\nSenior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost\n\nThis summer marked the 50th anniversary of the landmark Loving v. Virginia case , which invalidated laws banning interracial marriage in the U.S. in 1967.\n\nThe couple at the center of the case ― Mildred and Richard Loving ― simply wanted to get married, but in the process, they paved the way for countless other couples in America to wed.\n\nWith that in mind, Vice spoke with five modern-day couples about what it's like to be in mixed race marriage in America today. The short clip ― originally posted on June 13 to mark the anniversary of the legal case ― has over 11 million views on Facebook .\n\nOne couple, Erroll McDonald and Klara Glowczewska, have been married for 28 years but still get stares when they walk into rooms.\n\n\"There's never a time when we are in public when I'm not aware that we're an interracial couple. When we walk into a room, people take notice,\" McDonald says. \"Very early on, black women made it very clear that this was not cool.\"\n\nWhile some couples say their families have wholeheartedly embraced their partners, it hasn't been so easy for others, including Vaughn J. Buffalo and Gail Russell Buffalo. After four years of marriage, Vaughn has still never been invited to Gail's parents' house.\n\n\"For a little while, I was read the Riot Act ,\" Gail says of her family's reaction. \"It was not just my parents; my parents didn't know how to deal with it but my brothers were pretty upset. We're still finding our way.\"\n\nThrough telling their stories, the couples make it clear that while we don't live in a post-racial America, love helps bridge our divides.\n\n\"I notice color. I'm not colorblind,\" Jacqui Lewis says while sitting next to John Janka, her husband of 12 years. \"It's not that white folks aren't white folks and black folks aren't black folks. But this particular white folk is my soulmate and best friend.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Fifty Years Ago, the Supreme Court Knocked Down Bans on Interracial Marriage. How Have Things Changed Since Then?\n\nPeter Dreier is professor of Politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College\n\nMildred and Richard Loving\n\nShould we allow states to decide whether black Americans may marry white Americans? Today, such an idea seems absurd. Most Americans believe that states shouldn't be permitted to trample on the basic right of interracial couples to marry. It would be unfair - a clear violation of civil rights. But until 50 years ago (June 12, 1967), when the Supreme Court knocked down state laws banning interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia , 16 states still had such laws on the books. At the time, 72% of Americans opposed marriage between blacks and whites.\n\nBack then, the Supreme Court was far ahead of public opinion. In fact, it wasn't until the mid-1990s that even half of Americans said they approved of such interracial marriages. In 2013, the most recent poll on the topic, 87% of Americans - including 84% of whites and 96% of blacks - supported interracial marriage. It may be shocking to some that 13% of Americans still disapprove of black-white marriages, but the shift in public opinion over five decades has been steady and irreversible. Equally important, 96% of Americans younger than 30, and 83% of those who live in the South, now support interracial marriage.\n\nSince Loving v. Virginia , the number of interracial marriages has steadily increased, even in the South. In 1967, only 3% of newlyweds were intermarried. By 2015, that share had risen to 17%, according to the Pew Research Center. Only 10% of recent white newlyweds are intermarried but the number is higher in different parts of the country, including some parts of the South, including 27% in the San Antonio area, 20% in the Orlando, Florida and Tucson, Arizona areas, 19% in the Fayetteville, N.C. area, 15% in the Dallas-Forth Worth area, and 14% in greater Oklahoma City.\n\nIn 1967, Southern racists used \"states' rights\" as the justification to defend Jim Crow laws, including school segregation, racial discrimination in restaurants and on buses, severe limits on voting by African Americans, as well as bans on interracial marriage. More recently, opponents of marriage equality used the same rationale, claiming that marriage laws should be left to the states to decide. Indeed, the Loving ruling became a precedent in federal court decisions ruling that bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional, including in the landmark Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015.\n\nJeff Nichols' 2016 film, \"Loving,\" focused on the brave couple who brought their interracial marriage suit to the Supreme Court, and the inexperienced but savvy attorneys who represented them. As viewers quickly learn, the film's title is not a plea for compassion and understanding. It is the last name of the plaintiffs, a humble working-class couple who simply wanted to live as husband and wife and raise their children in Virginia, where they had been born and where they and their extended families lived.\n\nIn June 1958, Mildred Jeter (an African American) and Richard Loving (a white bricklayer) drove 90 miles from their home in Central Point in rural Virginia and got married in Washington, D.C., to circumvent Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which then made interracial marriage a crime. Six weeks later, the local police raided their home at 2 a.m., hoping to find them having sex, which was also a crime for interracial couples in Virginia. The cops found the couple asleep in bed. Richard showed them the marriage certificate on the bedroom wall. \"That's no good here,\" the sheriff responded. In fact, that document was used as evidence that the Lovings had violated Virginia law.\n\nThe Lovings were charged with \"cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.\"\n\nIn his ruling, Leon M. Bazile, the Virginia trial judge wrote:\n\n\"Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\"\n\nOn January 6, 1959, the Lovings pled guilty, and Bazile sentenced them to one year in prison. The judge offered to suspend their sentence if they agreed to leave the state for 25 years. They agreed, and reluctantly moved to Washington, D.C., where they lived in a cramped apartment and missed their family and friends in Virginia. In defiance of the agreement, they secretly moved back to Virginia, and soon found themselves in the middle of a controversial legal battle.\n\nThey knew that their marriage was unusual, but initially they weren't looking to change the law or embark on a crusade.\n\nLike two previous movies about this case - \"Mr. and Mrs. Loving\" (a 1996 made-for-TV dramatic film) and \"The Loving Story\" (a 2011 documentary) - \"Loving\" makes clear that neither Richard (played by Joel Edgerton) nor Mildred (Ruth Negga) were political activists. Poor and little-educated, they had grown up in the small town of Central Point, where interracial mixing - if not marriage - had been the norm. They fell in love and wanted to live together. They knew that their marriage was unusual, but initially they weren't looking to change the law or embark on a crusade. The phrase \"civil rights\" pops up in the film only when one of Mildred's relatives tells her, while watching Martin Luther King Jr. on television, \"You need to get you some civil rights.\"\n\nMildred got the idea to write to then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy for help. Kennedy referred her to the American Civil Liberties Union, which agreed to take their case. The two ACLU lawyers, Bernard Cohen and Philip Hirschkop were young and untested, but they were also persistent and clever.\n\nIn November 1963, the two lawyers filed a motion in the state trial court to reverse the Lovings' sentence on the grounds that it violated the Constitution's 14th Amendment. It took four years to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. In the interim years, the civil-rights movement galvanized America and stirred its conscience about racial injustice. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Change was in the air. But interracial marriage was the last taboo. Given public opinion at the time, it was an issue that Congress was unlikely to confront but that the Supreme Court might tackle.\n\nIn 1967, Chief Justice Earl Warren, the moderate Republican who had skillfully engineered a unanimous 9-0 vote in the Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation case in 1954, still led the court. As with the earlier case, Warren believed that the nation needed to see the Supreme Court united on the potentially explosive issue of interracial marriage.\n\nIt was certainly, in today's parlance, no slam dunk. Five of Warren's Supreme Court colleagues had been appointed by Democratic presidents-William O. Douglas and Hugo Black by Franklin Roosevelt, Tom Clark by Harry Truman, Byron White by John F. Kennedy, and Abe Fortas by Lyndon Johnson-but they espoused different views on a variety of legal and social issues.\n\nAs Southern Democrats , Black and Clark understood how explosive the Loving case would be. Black, who had represented Alabama in the U.S. Senate from 1927 to 1937, no doubt felt guilt over his racist past. In 1926, when running for the Senate, Black had joined the Ku Klux Klan, thinking that he needed its members' votes. He spoke at Klan meetings, espousing anti-black and anti-Catholic views. Near the end of his life, Black would admit that joining the Klan was a mistake, but also said \"I would have joined any group if it helped get me votes.\" In 1929, Black wrote to a constituent denouncing an interracial marriage in New York, observing that \"New York State should have a law prohibiting this sort of thing,\" according to a biography by Roger Newman. In the Senate, Black was an ardent New Dealer, but hardly a progressive on racial issues. He consistently opposed the passage of anti-lynching legislation, and even led a filibuster of an anti-lynching bill.\n\nClark, a Texan, was an assistant to U.S. Attorney General Biddle when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. Biddle named Clark to be Civilian Coordinator of the Alien Enemy Control Program that interned Japanese Americans and other supposed enemies of the United States. Like Warren, Clark later acknowledged that internment had been a mistake. Appointed attorney general by Truman in 1945, Clark helped formulate and carry out Truman's aggressive Cold War anti-communist policies, including requiring federal employees to sign loyalty oaths and helping blacklist liberals and radicals. But Clark also played a key role in supporting Truman's civil-rights efforts. He filed a brief in the landmark (and controversial) Shelley v. Kraemer case that, in 1948, struck down racial covenants in housing contracts that had restricted real-estate sales to blacks. He also helped oversee Truman's civil-rights committee that released an important report, To Secure These Rights , which had 35 recommendations that included ending segregation and poll taxes, laws to protect voting rights, and the creation of a civil-rights division in the Department of Justice.\n\nThat case once again demonstrated Warren's skills at persuading his colleagues into a unanimous decision.\n\nThree of Warren's Supreme Court colleagues - John Harlan, William Brennan, and Potter Stewart - had, like Warren, been appointed by Republican President Dwight Eisenhower. Harlan was a conservative who nevertheless often voted in favor of civil rights - in the same mold as his grandfather and namesake, the only dissenting justice in the landmark 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case that upheld the constitutionality of state segregation laws under the \"separate but equal\" doctrine. But Harlan was also the lone dissenter in the 1964 Reynolds v. Sims decision, which established the \"one man, one vote\" principle that ensured equal protection under the 14th Amendment. In 1956, Eisenhower appointed Brennan - a Republican-appointed federal judge in New Jersey - for purely political reasons. Brennan was a Democrat and a Catholic, and Eisenhower, who was running for re-election, wanted to appeal to both constituencies. Only one senator, Republican Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, voted against Brennan's confirmation. Stewart was from a prominent conservative Ohio family, and a frequent Warren Court dissenter, but in the 1965 case Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham , he ruled with the majority to bar police from using an anti-loitering law to prevent civil-rights activists from standing or demonstrating sidewalks, a clear civil-rights victory. That case demonstrated once again Warren's skills at persuading his colleagues into a unanimous decision. The justices deciding that case no doubt recognized that, despite the fact that many Americans still opposed interracial marriage, the tide of history was turning, and they wanted to be on the right side.\n\nIn Loving v. Virginia , the Supreme Court struck down all state anti-miscegenation laws and declared marriage to be an inherent right. Warren penned the opinion for the court, noting that the Virginia law endorsed the doctrine of white supremacy. He wrote:\n\n\"Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our very existence and survival. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination.\"\n\nThe Lovings don't even bother to attend the court hearing. Richard Loving simply said to one of the attorneys, \"Tell the judge I love my wife and it is just unfair that I can't live with her in Virginia.\"\n\nAt the time, most Americans did not accept that simple statement. Public opinion, particularly in the South, lagged behind the court's ruling. In 1969, two years after the Loving ruling, members of Georgia's state legislature and Board of Regents objected to hiring former Secretary of State Dean Rusk to a teaching job at the University of Georgia because he had participated in his daughter's wedding to a black man. Although the Loving ruling had invalidated state laws banning interracial marriage, many Southern states were slow to erase their own laws. South Carolina didn't repeal its law until 1998; Alabama didn't do so until 2000.\n\nIf one rereads Warren's words in Loving v. Virginia , and substitutes the term \"same-sex marriage\" for \"interracial marriage,\" the argument is no less compelling. Most Americans now agree that to deny gays and lesbians the right to marry is, as Warren wrote in Loving , \"directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nThe civil-rights movement laid the foundation for the gay-rights crusade, which adopted many of its strategies and tactics, including grassroots organizing, protest and civil disobedience, court challenges, lobbying, and campaigning to elect sympathetic candidates.\n\nAfter the gay-rights movement burgeoned in the 1970s, more and more public figures - politicians, entertainers, teachers, judges, journalists, businesspersons, athletes, and clergy members - acknowledged their homosexuality. TV sitcoms began to feature openly gay characters. In 2002, the New York Times began publishing announcements of same-sex civil unions and weddings. Massachusetts Democrat Gerry Studds came out of the closet in 1983 - the first member of Congress to do this. Now there are seven openly gay and lesbian members in the House and one, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, in the U.S. Senate. All 50 states now have at least one openly gay elected official, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. In 2013, NBA player Jason Collins became the first pro athlete on a major American sports team to come out of the closet. The following year, Apple's Tim Cook became the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 corporation.\n\nAs gay activism accelerated, attitudes changed. Americans who believe that people \"choose\" to be gay fell from 40% in 1994 to 25% in 2014.\n\nAs advocates began to put specific issues on the agenda, public support increased for openly gay public school teachers, health benefits for gay partners, gay adoption, AIDS research funding, and for campaigns to end anti-sodomy laws, anti-LGBT workplace and housing discrimination, and hate crimes against gays. Support for gays serving openly in the military rose from 44% in 1993, to more than 75% in 2008. In 2010, President Obama signed legislation ending the government's 17-year \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.\n\nAs with interracial marriage, more and more people have confronted an issue that was once taboo. A growing number of Americans have realized that they know gay people. In 1992, only 52% of Americans said that they knew someone who was gay or lesbian. By 2010, that figure had increased to 76%. Not surprisingly, people who know someone who is gay or lesbian voice less disapproval, higher comfort levels, and greater support for same-sex marriage, polls have found.\n\nIn 1996, only 27% of Americans believed it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to marry. By this year, that number had increased to 64%, a new high, according to the Gallup Poll.\n\nMoreover, support for gay marriage is much higher among younger Americans. Among millennials (18-29 year olds), 83% endorse gay marriage. But support has also been increasing among older Americans. Among Americans over 65 (born before 1951), support for same-sex marriage has increased to 53%.\n\nAccording to the latest poll , 74% of Democrats, 71% of independents, and 47% of Republicans favor same-sex marriage.\n\nIn June 2015, in its Obergefell v. Hodges decision, the Supreme Court overturned state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage, thus legalizing marriage equality throughout the country. In some ways, the ruling followed in the footsteps of Loving v. Virginia , but the two verdicts also differ substantially. The Loving decision was unanimous. The Obergefell ruling on same-sex marriage was decided narrowly by 5 to 4.\n\nFour members of the nation's highest court - Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia (now deceased), and Clarence Thomas - opposed marriage equality. Each had his own public and private justifications, but history will record that all four of them supported states' rights over equal rights, bigotry over tolerance.\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Anthony Kennedy (who cast the swing vote) will be remembered for embracing the notion that marriage is a matter of personal choice. Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, cited Loving v. Virginia several times, explaining that it had established an \"abiding connection between marriage and liberty.\"\n\nDuring last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump flip-flopped on the subject of marriage equality numerous times. At one point he promised to appoint justices to erase the Supreme Court's 2015 Obergefell ruling. Later he said that his personal views on same-sex marriage are \"irrelevant,\" claiming that the case \"was already settled.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

The Trump administration has also revoked protections for transgender school students. Trump refused to endorse this month's Gay Pride celebrations, events previously marked by White House support.\n\nEven if Neil Gorsuch, Trump's only Supreme Court pick so far, opposes same-sex marriage, the current line-up of justices would not likely overturn the Obergefell ruling, since five of them had already voted in support of same-sex marriage. But if Trump gets to select another justice, all bets are off. And if Trump is forced to resign and Vice President Mike Pence becomes president, we'd have an even stronger opponent of LGBT rights in the White House. In 2015, as Indiana governor, Pence signed the country's first state \"religious freedom\" bill - allowing individuals and businesses to deny services they feel are contrary to their religious beliefs.\n\nHomophobia has not disappeared. A hard core of anti-gay Americans, including some politicians and clergy members, still generate headlines. Republican efforts to weaken laws protecting LGBT persons from discrimination may play to their current base, but their followers are shrinking. The days of gay-bashing as a political strategy are numbered. The gay rights movement has clearly won Americans' hearts and minds.\n\nMildred and Richard Loving's struggle foreshadowed the more recent battle over same-sex marriage. Perhaps not surprisingly, Mildred Loving embraced the idea of marriage equality for gays and lesbians before she died in 2008. In June 2007, on the 40th anniversary of the case that bore her name, she issued the following statement:\n\n\"I believe all Americans, no matter their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual orientation, should have that same freedom to marry. Government has no business imposing some people's religious beliefs over others. Especially if it denies people's civil rights. I am still not a political person, but I am proud that Richard's and my name is on a court case that can help reinforce the love, the commitment, the fairness, and the family that so many people, black or white, young or old, gay or straight seek in life. I support the freedom to marry for all. That's what Loving, and loving, are all about.\"\n\nPeter Dreier is professor of politics at Occidental College.

      "text": "Black Women, Interracial Dating, and Marriage: What's Love Got to Do With It?\n\nProfessor, Department of Afroamerican and African Studies, University of Michigan\n\nWith Thanksgiving just around the corner, I cannot help but dwell on who might be coming to dinner. Last holiday season gave me plenty of food for thought on this all too familiar and often uncomfortable racially-tinged question. One of my male relatives brought home a date for Thanksgiving who could have been Barbie's twin sister. She was blonde, thin, big-bosomed, and even had a Germanic name. She was probably very nice; but I cannot say for sure. She was shy and didn't talk much in what was likely an unfamiliar and perhaps overwhelming African American social setting. Another of my male relatives brought home a woman for Christmas who seemed like a modern-day, socially progressive southern belle. She was blonde, full figured, outgoing, and outspoken with a saucy southern accent and friendly, expressive manner. Two of my younger male relatives have recently been engaged to white women, and one tied the knot last summer. This is a pattern that I have observed in my professional life for years: successful black men pairing up with white women, but now that the practice has come home to roost, so to speak, I cannot help but admit to feeling a bit demoralized.\n\nI wish my male relatives luck and joy in their relationships, but I also feel a pinch when I watch them with their girlfriends. It is the same sharp tug of disappointment that gets me every time I see a black man with a white woman on his arm. Try as I might to suppress the reaction, I experience black men's choice of white women as a personal rejection of the group in which I am a part, of African American women as a whole, who have always been devalued in this society.\n\nCertainly my reaction links back to a few bad apples in my own young dating years. Once I overheard my black boyfriend telling his buddies how he preferred white women; on another occasion (with a different black boyfriend) a guy told me he didn't care that I was breaking up with him because he could go out and get a white woman, which was what he really wanted anyway. For both these men (and to be fair, they were not much older than 20 at the time and thus had plenty of maturing to do), white women were the pinnacle of womanhood -- the prize that they secretly coveted, the emotional weapon that they knew they could wield. But personal moments of rejection are not the driving force behind my resentful feelings about black male-white female relationships now. The driving force is, instead, my awareness of all of the (straight) African American women -- beautiful, smart, good women, some of them my own family and friends -- who might not have a honey to bring home this Thanksgiving holiday because they cannot find a date, even as rising numbers of eligible African American men will be wooing white women.\n\nIn a perfect world, love would be blind. Individuals would choose each other for kindness, intelligence, perseverance, courage, and a host of other mysterious reasons that make attraction so magical. Race and the characteristics that have come to represent it -- like skin color, eye color, and hair texture -- would not be factors in matters of the heart. This is the way things would be if our love lives actually mirrored recent scientific findings, which tell us the human family is so genetically close that we share more than 99 percent of our DNA. Genetically speaking, there are no racial categories; race is merely skin deep. Dating and marrying across racial lines should therefore be natural, common and acceptable. But this is not a perfect world. This is the United States, where a deep-seated notion of racial difference has been the rationalization for oppression, the rallying cry for discrimination against people who are not white. Within this racialized landscape in which whiteness has reigned supreme, the line between white and black has been the starkest marker of racial difference, with the white side of the line representing all that is positive, and the black side of the line representing all that is negative. Whiteness has been a privileged and prized identity in the U.S.; our national culture has made it this way. So when black men select white women and de-select black women, they are doing so in a context of charged racial meanings.\n\nThis is not a cut and dried issue. It is tangled and difficult. I recognize that many people form loving relationships across the black-white color line. Some of the people I admire and respect most in my professional life are black men married to white women and white women married to black men. These relationships are caring and genuine, and surely bring happiness to the individuals involved in them. I have even dated outside of my racial group, and I married someone who isn't black -- a Native American man (with, I must add, distant French and African ancestry). But this collection of happily ever after stories does not mean that love is blind. Romantic attraction is subject to the larger social forces of racial prestige and stigma that swirl all around us, and in this environment, black women are losing out. Despite the steamy scenes on ABC's hit show, Scandal (and yes, I am a fan), most single black women are not dating white men (and certainly not hunky white men who hold high government offices and are willing to risk all they have achieved for illicit love). Many single black women are instead finding themselves ignored in today's dating scene.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Log in to hide these messages.\n\nWhile interracial marriage rates in this country have grown remarkably to 8.4 percent in 2010, Americans still marry within their own racial group the majority of the time. And when people do venture across the color line to date, they do so in ways that continue to affirm a social hierarchy based on race in which whiteness is prized. White men are the most sought after dates by women of all groups (except for African American women, who, researchers speculate, may rule out white men due to the fear of being stereotyped). White men can therefore afford to be the pickiest group in the online dating market; they respond to fewer overtures than other men on dating websites, and they have a strong preference for white women. White women are less willing than white men to date outside of their racial group, but heavier-set white women are more willing to date black men, because, researchers Cynthia Feliciano, Belinda Robnett, and Golnaz Komaie of UC Irvine posit, of \"racial-beauty exchange theory\" -- the notion that a white woman who is less attractive by the measure of dominant Euro-American beauty standards is willing to \"trade down\" on the racial hierarchy by dating a black man. By the same token, black men who date white women are \"trading up\" on the American racial hierarchy.\n\nMost striking to me in recent sociological studies about interracial dating and marriage, is that on every measure, African American women seem to come out at the bottom of the pile. Black people as a whole intermarry with whites less frequently than other people of color do; and black women intermarry far less than black men. This is due in part to the unsettling evidence that many groups of men do not prefer black women. According to data released by the online dating site OkCupid , black women (perhaps due to politeness; perhaps due to the recognition of their less desirable status) respond to more initial overtures than other groups; at the same time, black women's initial contacts are ignored most often. In today's dating market black women are less preferred -- and here is the kicker -- sometimes even by black men. Social science researchers posit that black men's attraction to white women as evidenced by dating behavior and growing intermarriage rates is in part historically rooted. Because white women were taboo for black men for centuries in this country to the extent that black men could be lynched for the appearance of involvement with white women, access to white women may be more alluring for black men now. Sociologists also find that because white Americans as a whole are still the most powerful racial group in this country (politically, economically, and socially), non-whites seek to marry into that group in order to increase their own social status. As UC Berkeley sociologist Gerald Mendelsohn put it in an interview: \"One theory is that blacks are acting like other minority populations in the history of this country . . . They are interested in moving up in the power structure, and one way you do that is through intermarriage with the dominant group.\"\n\nThese racial and gender preferences and the reasons behind them may not be conscious to people in the dating world, who, by and large, would probably decry bias against black women. Nevertheless, these preferences have real effects. While more black men date and marry white women than ever before, more black women cannot even get a first \"chat\" on Internet dating sites. African American women are plagued by persistent, age-old stereotypes that represent them as too strong, argumentative and unfeminine. And as wonderful as they are, African American women can never measure up to the narrowly defined beauty ideals based on Euro-American aesthetics that are so firmly entrenched in this culture. Even after the Black is Beautiful seventies, it is still the case that when African American women are upheld as beautiful in popular media, they usually have lighter skin, longer hair, and thinner body types that adhere more closely to those dominant standards.\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama is a glowing exception to these daunting data and a beacon of beauty in this skewed aesthetic environment. The person who would become one of the most successful black men in the history of the world chose her, and she him. So to all of the African American women out there who feel like your shine is not being recognized, who feel a little pinch of rejection each time you see an accomplished black man with a white woman on his arm: take heart. We may be down in this cultural contest for love and appreciation, but we are not out.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Virginia , the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled that state laws prohibiting mixed-race marriages were unconstitutional.\n\nTo commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ruling, The Loving Project is documenting the experiences of couples whose marriages would have been illegal in some states prior to 1967 through photos and their own words.\n\nThe Loving Project is produced by Farrah Parkes and Brad Linder, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who are themselves an interracial couple. Another interracial couple, Cathie Berrey-Green and her husband Al Green from BG Productions Photography and Videography photographed the couples highlighted in the project. Both couples have been married for 10 years.\n\nThe goal of the project is not just to celebrate a landmark in civil rights, but also to explore what it's like to be part of a mixed-race marriage at this time in America's history. Through her photos, Cathie wanted to capture the true essence of each family, rather than making a formal family portrait.\n\nCathie and Al wanted to get involved in this project because they felt that what it is like being in an interracial relationship, and the fact that marriages like theirs were illegal not that long ago, is something many people never think about. Being in an interracial marriage they have experienced a variety of negative opinions from some, but they never let that bother them. Cathie and Al wanted to let people see how beautiful multiculturalism is and that diversity and love is what Makes America Great, not the division the current administration endorses.\n\nThe photos and accompanying podcast are on display at the Bill Russell Gallery in Philadelphia. At the end of the gallery show, the photos will be given to each couple that is a part of the project. Listen to some of the couples' stories here and see more photos below.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Watch How On-Screen Interracial Relationships Evolved To Give Us 'Get Out'\n\nSenior Culture Writer, HuffPost\n\nLast month, the social horror film \"Get Out\" was No. 1 at the box office and gained the rare, coveted 100 percent \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film, about a black man visiting his white girlfriend's parents for the first time (to disastrous results) comes from the mind of Jordan Peele, a mixed-race comedian and filmmaker who also happens to be in an interracial relationship himself.\n\nThat \"Get Out\" not only exists, but has done so well commercially and critically, speaks to how far Hollywood has come in terms of on-screen representation of white and black love. One of the earliest depictions of a black man and a white woman together on screen was D.W. Griffith's 1915 film \"The Birth of a Nation,\" where the black man was depicted as a stereotypical, sex-crazed rapist eager to steal the innocence of a white girl.\n\nIn the 1930s, anti-miscegenation laws made interracial relationships a taboo, and the industry's strict Hays Code made it so that mixed-race relationships in movies were not only taboo ― they were also forbidden on screen. Of course, this didn't stop filmmakers from tiptoeing on the line between what could and could not be shown ― romances between white actors and starlets like Josephine Baker and Dorothy Dandridge in the 1930s and '50s were implied, though never consummated with a kiss.\n\nBut Hollywood romance, of course, is all about the kiss. That line was first crossed in 1965's \"A Patch of Blue,\" where Sidney Poitier shared an on-screen kiss with white actress Elizabeth Hartman, who was playing a blind girl. The brief scene was considered so risqué that the kiss had to be cut from the film in theaters in the South.\n\nSince the landmark 1967 Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia, which made interracial marriage legal across the United States, attitudes toward interracial love have definitely changed. Gone are the days when a 10-second kiss between a black man and a white woman in a film would have to be cut just to screen in an American theater.\n\nBut there's still a tension, an uneasiness with how we approach these relationships on screen. As The New York Times reports, while mixed-race marriages and relationships in America have reached record highs , it isn't necessarily reflected in the stories we see on the big and small screen.\n\nInterracial relationships, both on screen and in real life, are a sign of change ― but they aren't necessarily a sign of racial progress. Think of the narratives that we so often see played out in movies about interracial relationships. First, it's almost always a black and white couple ― this year's Oscar-nominated \"Lion,\" starring Dev Patel, was one of the rare instances of seeing an Asian man in an on-screen romance with a woman of a different race.\n\nNext, the conflict always hinges on the couple being from two \"different worlds\" ― think \"Save the Last Dance\" or \"Jungle Fever.\" This narrative is obviously a reality for many interracial couples, but it's a narrative that's been used in the same way so many times that it's lost all nuance. Progress, then, doesn't just come with interracial couples on screen, or the box office numbers they get ― progress also comes with the kinds of stories we're seeing, and the way in which they are being told.\n\nThat's what makes \"Get Out\" a special kind of monster. It takes the classic \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\" comedy-drama storyline and turns it on its head by filtering it through the prism of horror and suspense.\n\nWe're past films that gawk at the novelty of a black person and a white person in a relationship. We're past films that present these relationships as the answer to racism. If film is a mirror of ourselves, our representations say a lot about where we are as a society today.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "10 Things Interracial Couples Wish You'd Stop Asking Them\n\nSenior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost\n\nIt's been more than fifty years since the landmark Loving v. Virginia case invalidated laws banning interracial marriage in the U.S.\n\nThese days, interracial relationships are incredibly common. According to Pew research, about 17 percent of new marriages and 20 percent of cohabiting relationships are interracial or interethnic. And about one-quarter of Americans have a close relative in an interracial marriage.\n\nThe numbers of interracial unions may be rising, but couples in the relationships still encounter a lot of questions ― and some of them are straight-up rude. Below, interracial couples share 10 questions and misconceptions they're sick of hearing.\n\n\"I get asked this question frequently from other members of my community and it frustrates me. Yes, I have dated black men and I've dated other minorities as well. I don't have a preference when it comes to the color of my partner's skin; I looked more for compatibility and personality when I was single ― something I wish other people would take the time to learn. All that matters at the end of the day is that you and your partner see eye-to-eye on most of the important issues in this life. I know race can affect people's opinions on those topics, but for us ― and probably for others in most interracial relationships ― it never becomes a big problem.\" ― Vladimir Sabajo, who lives in New York City and runs the YouTube channel VladixDean with his partner Dean Carter\n\n\"We're not your average heteronormative couple, but we still interact with each other in almost the same manner. We have shared interests, we share cleaning responsibilities around the house, and we even have the occasional disagreement just like any two people living in close quarters. The fact that we are both men and are both from different racial backgrounds does not affect our daily life as much as most people assume. For instance, we both hold steady jobs but many people assume that because I'm white and feminine, that Vladimir takes care of me financially. It's a mindset that is rooted in both misogyny and racism: It's based on the idea that black skin equates to hypermasculinity and that white skin equates to fragility. This kind of thinking dehumanizes both parties and creates unnecessary stereotypes that can be damaging to relationships.\" ― Dean Carter\n\n\"Do you really need to double take every time we hold hands? We don't feel like we look that shocking, and we're certainly not interesting enough to be gawked at in public. The stunned staring is really unnecessary, and honestly pretty disturbing when you're on the receiving end of it. We're not on display, we're just a couple.\" ― Ariana Offray , who lives in Los Angeles, California and runs the YouTube channel Ariana Raw with her partner Hannah Glover\n\n\"Cultural differences aren't a negative thing. We've found that they've made our relationship stronger and helped us grow as individuals. They haven't torn us apart.\" ― Bethany Struble, who lives in Los Angeles California with her partner Peter Adrian Sudarso and runs the YouTube channel Bethany Struble Vlogs\n\n\"We're of different races but one of the main reasons we get on so well as a couple is because of how similar we are. We have similar values, mindsets and interests. If anything, being in an interracial relationship actually shows you how likeminded you are to someone of a different race.\" ― Kimmy Kimani , who lives in the U.K. and runs the YouTube channel James and Kimmy with her partner James Alexander Hobbs\n\n\"People (even within our own families sometimes) ask us if we will adopt babies that 'looks like us.′ Thing is, we are already an 'unconventional' family and we are aware that our family will look different anyway. Hence we do not care for the ethnicity of our children. They will be loved and welcomed like any other child would be in any other family.\" ― David Levesque, who lives in Toronto, Canada and runs the YouTube channel HueDavid with his husband Huey Tran\n\n\"Yes, our kids will be cute if we so chose to have them but that's because all babies are cute. Our baby being 'mixed' doesn't make them any cuter than someone else's child.\" ― Harsh Patel , who lives in New Jersey and runs the YouTube channel Harsh and Des with his partner DesTynee Covington\n\n\"First off, thanks for assuming that I would marry a man based off his income. Second, do you think a man of another race is not capable of making a lot of money? Third, do you think white men are so undesirable that the only way I'd be interested was if they were wealthy? This is by far the worst question I've been asked about being in an interracial marriage because it's loaded with not only one but many insults. I married this man because I love him...end of story.\" ― Jackie Iadonisi , who lives in Los Angeles with her husband Nick Iadonisi and runs the YouTube channel Jackie's Adventures\n\n\"Yes, we live in a globalized world now, but not everyone is open to the idea that two different worlds could come together in the name of love. This is hard, but we don't take it personally when other family members need a moment to digest our relationship. We've learned that some might be overly joyed and fascinated by an interracial couple, while others might take longer to accept or have their prejudices dissolved.\" ― Henrik Stenberg, who lives in Sweden and runs the YouTube channel Henrik and Rachel with his partner Rachel Otieno\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Interracial Marriage: Many Deep South Republican Voters Believe Interracial Marriage Should Be Illegal\n\nDespite the fact that the number of interracial marriages in the U.S. reached an all-time high this year , there are many who still believe that mixed-race marriage is unacceptable and should be made illegal, according to a new report.\n\nOn Monday, polling firm Public Policy Polling (PPP) revealed that 29 percent of likely GOP voters surveyed in Mississippi believe that interracial marriage should be illegal. Fifty-four percent said intermarriage should remain legal, and the rest responded that they weren't sure. The survey also found that 21 percent of likely GOP voters polled in Alabama believe that interracial marriage should be illegal.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court declared anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional more than four decades ago in 1967, Alabama kept a state-level law on the books until 2000. Many mixed-race couples in the Deep South are still struggling to feel safe and be accepted in their communities.\n\nIn November 2011, Stella Harville and her fiance, Ticha Chikuni, a native of Zimbabwe, were banned from a Kentucky church for being an interracial couple. The church also ruled that married interracial couples could be prohibited from becoming members. A month later, the congregation overturned their decision , deeming their earlier ruling \"discriminatory.\"\n\nAnd in May 2011, Debra Dodd, a former church secretary from Tennessee, was fired , she claims, after the all-white church where she worked learned she married a black man. The church has denied that her firing was related to her interracial marriage, but Dodd sued the church in December 2011 for racial discrimination. No updates on the lawsuit have been reported.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that 29% of self-identified Republicans in Mississippi and 21% of self-identified Republicans in Alabama felt intermarriage should be illegal. The post has been updated to correct self-identified Republicans to likely GOP voters. Also, information has been added to clarify that miscegenation laws were invalidated in 1967, but that several had remained codified until as recently as 2000.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nAfter Dobbs , liberals are warning of a Supreme Court assault on personal liberties like sexual autonomy, contraception, and even interracial marriage. But the court actually has its sights on social and labor protections - and progressives are unprepared.\n\nVisitors leave the Supreme Court in Washington, DC on October 31, 2022. (Eric Lee for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAfter Roe v. Wade was overturned in June , the progressive legal commentator Mark Joseph Stern wrote that the US Supreme Court would now conduct \"an all-out assault on . . . gay rights, marriage, and contraception, among other personal liberties,\" declaring that \"these rights are now in grave and immediate jeopardy.\" Various prominent thinkers in the progressive legal world - including Amy Gajda , Leah Litman, Melissa Murray, Kate Shaw , and, from the bench of the Supreme Court, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan - have expressed similar fears. The American Civil Liberties Union even hosted a discussion on \"how dismantling Roe puts interracial marriage at risk.\"\n\nThese fears are unfounded. The conservative legal movement, after its triumph in overturning Roe , is not now coming for your condoms, reimposing Jim Crow standards of morality, or declaring war on gay couples. In reality, the greatest future threat posed by the conservative legal movement is not that it will take away these various rights but that it will revive rights long marginalized by the courts, especially so-called economic liberties. These liberties have already been invoked to undermine the labor movement, and, now that the fight against Roe is out of the way, conservative activists and judges are eager to attack a wide range of social protections across the country.\n\nTo be sure, the claim that the end of Roe is phase one of a broader judicial assault on privacy and autonomy is based on a rational premise. Although Justice Samuel Alito, in his Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization opinion, tried to emphasize that the decision was limited to abortion , the logic that he and his five conservative colleagues used to strike down Roe v. Wade seems to have ominous implications. While Alito conceded that the Supreme Court does and should protect certain \"unenumerated\" rights that are not explicitly written in the Constitution, he argued that this protection should be limited to rights that are \"deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition.\"\n\nThe potential problems here are obvious. Same-sex marriage was not \"deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition\" when the Supreme Court defined it as a constitutional right in 2015 , and the conservative justices said as much in dissent. Anti-sodomy laws were \"rooted in the nation's history and tradition\" when the court invalidated them in 2003 (again over conservative dissent), as were anti-miscegenation laws before the court invalidated them in 1967 . States restricted access to contraception before the court said that they could not in 1965 (for married couples) and 1972 (for single people). Considering this historical picture, progressive legal commentators can be forgiven for thinking that the doctrinal door is now open for challenges to these rights and liberties.\n\nHowever, this analysis suffers from several flaws. First, Alito was correct to argue that Roe v. Wade was different from all these other privacy and autonomy cases. As Ruth Bader Ginsburg observed in 1985 , Roe was unprecedented in its \"sweep and detail\": invalidating the existing abortion laws of every state except New York and creating a trimester framework for abortion regulation that its author, Justice Harry Blackmun, did not even try to root in constitutional theory. Everyone in the legal world knew that Roe v. Wade was uniquely flimsy and vulnerable .\n\nBut the real reason not to expect a cascade of cases against privacy and autonomy is because the conservative legal movement is not interested in bringing them. No one at the Federalist Society's 2022 National Lawyers Convention - held November 10-12 in Washington, DC - mentioned sodomy, miscegenation, restrictions on contraception, or gay marriage, nor have any litigators for the increasingly influential Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) , based in Sacramento, California, where I live and work. When I suggested to one of my students that they test the future of personal autonomy law by walking into the PLF headquarters and complaining about rampant condom use and excessive race mixing, the response of the classroom was laughter. Rightly so: the conservative legal movement lost these culture wars decisively, and the prospect of refighting them is very remote indeed.\n\nSo what is the conservative legal movement doing in the aftermath of Dobbs ? Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) and other organizations have put substantial time and energy into eliminating racial classifications in college admissions. Both liberal and conservative analysts now recognize that this campaign - like the campaign against Roe - has succeeded . The only question is how , not if , the Supreme Court will rule in favor of SFFA and against Harvard and the University of North Carolina in the cases it heard on October 31 , with decisions expected to be delivered in June . Conservative legal organizations will also continue their work on the expansion of religious liberty claims , including the high school football coaches who want to pray on the fifty-yard line and the bakers (or website designers ) who don't want to endorse same-sex marriage\n\nWhile cases and controversies like these receive constant and high-profile media coverage, others - with just as, if not more, serious implications - are being overlooked.\n\nOne in particular carries significant dangers: Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid (2021). This case involved a challenge to California's Agricultural Labor Relations Act (ALRA), which was enacted in 1975 in response to the determined activism of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers (UFW). The ALRA \" gives agricultural employees a right to self-organization and makes it an unfair labor practice for employers to interfere with that right.\" To enforce this right, the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board granted agricultural unions access \"to the premises of an agricultural employer for the purpose of meeting and talking with employees and soliciting their support . . . for up to four 30-day periods in one calendar year\" so long as the union notified the board and the employer in writing and only talked to workers before work, after work, or during their lunch break.\n\nCedar Point Nursery, whose small, seasonal workforce grows strawberries in Northern California, argued that this regulation constituted a \"taking\" of private property, thus requiring \"just compensation\" from the government in accordance with the Fifth Amendment . In similar prior cases , the Supreme Court had applied a \"multifactor test\" when determining whether a regulation amounted to a \"taking,\" considering the \"economic impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action.\"\n\nCedar Point Nursery - really the PLF, which brought the lawsuit free of charge - didn't argue that the ALRA regulation had an adverse economic impact or interfered with business expectations. Instead, it argued that \"unions . . . have no special right to invade private property and disrupt commercial operations, and property owners have a fundamental right to exclude trespassers. Government can't make a regulation violating that right even if it limits the hours when it applies.\" In a six-three opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court accepted this argument.\n\nCedar Point Nursery matters because the \"takings clause\" of the Fifth Amendment has not carried serious weight since the 1930s, when a stubbornly conservative Supreme Court was embroiled in a damaging confrontation with the Roosevelt administration and state-level economic reformers across the country. The court retreated from this fight after Roosevelt's massive triumph in the 1936 presidential election and subsequent threat to pack the court. A 1938 footnote in United States v. Carolene Products Company declared that the court would henceforth allow most economic and social regulations to stand.\n\nBefore this historic retreat, the \"takings clause\" was one among many tools that the court used to dismantle progressive legislation. The most infamous was the \"liberty of contract\" doctrine, which was not written anywhere in the Constitution but was invoked to strike down laws on maximum hours , minimum wages , and the right to form a union without employer intimidation. The current Supreme Court has shown no desire to resurrect this doctrine, although the influential libertarian scholar Randy Barnett has begun to revitalize \"liberty of contract\" in the Federalist Society , and Fifth Circuit Judge James Ho recently suggested that the courts should recognize a similar unwritten right to \"earn a living.\" Nevertheless, the current Supreme Court has flirted with another pre-1938 idea: the \"nondelegation\" doctrine , which prohibits Congress from transferring essentially legislative functions to the executive branch.\n\nLike \"liberty of contract,\" the \"nondelegation\" doctrine finds no explicit support in the text of the Constitution, but its potential impact on government is far-reaching. Virtually the entire machinery of the federal government is a product of \"delegation\": administrative agencies that Congress has invested with deliberately vague legal mandates to, for instance, \"set fair and equitable prices\" or \"just and reasonable rates,\" and \"issue whatever air quality standards are requisite to protect the public health.\" A full-scale attack on delegation is an attack on government itself.\n\nThe court nearly invoked the nondelegation doctrine for the third time ever in 2019, but its then four liberal justices were able to poach Justice Alito for an opinion upholding the broad delegations contained in the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA). This year, however, a six-three Court deployed a cousin of the nondelegation doctrine - the so-called major questions doctrine - to invalidate the heart of the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lost in West Virginia v. EPA not because it could never legally enact these regulations but because the regulations had such \"economic and political significance\" that they required a more explicit congressional authorization.\n\nGroups like the PLF and the Federalist Society are excited about these cases (see, for example, this discussion at the Federalist Society's convention). And they will bring more of them - scouring the country for honest small businesses (like Cedar Point Nursery) that claim to be menaced by oppressive red tape. Crucially, these cases will initially be heard by district and appeals court judges, many of whom were appointed by the Trump administration almost exclusively on the advice of the Federalist Society. While the progressive legal movement prepares for nonexistent challenges to contraception and interracial marriage, the conservative legal movement will push on with real challenges to the future of economic regulation.\n\nAs Peter Canellos recently documented in a series of interviews with major Federalist Society figures, there is some ambivalence among conservatives about fully leaning into pre-New Deal judicial philosophy. After all, the Federalist Society was initially created with the intention of cutting the judiciary down to size.\n\nBut that was when the judiciary was controlled by liberals, and Cedar Point Nursery and West Virginia v. EPA are far from the first steps that the conservative Supreme Court has taken in the economic field. Chief Justice Roberts was praised by liberals for casting the decisive vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act in 2012, but his opinion in that case included a diminution of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. In 2017, a five-four Court decided that public-sector employees have a First Amendment right to enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining without paying a penny to their unions, undermining labor legislation in virtually every Democratic state. Earlier, in 2010, another five-four First Amendment ruling - the infamous Citizens United v. FEC - gutted the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance law.\n\nOne way or another, the conservative legal movement seems determined to keep this momentum going. Now they have six justices and, thanks to the Trump Administration, nearly a third of the nation's district and appeals court judges . With Roe v. Wade gone, the age-old causes of property and profit can take center stage.\n\nHarry Blain is an assistant professor of political science at California State University, Sacramento, where he teaches courses on constitutional rights and liberties.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Kennedy Human Rights Ripple of Hope Gala on December 6, 2022, in New York City. (Mike Coppola / Getty Images for 2022 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Ripple of Hope Gala)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nHarry & Meghan , the new documentary from Netflix that chronicles the love story, marriage, and eventual departure from the royal family of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in their own words, has a lot of grand ambitions. It wants viewers to see Harry and Meghan as two normal people who just happened to fall in love - a \"modern fairy tale,\" says Meghan. It wants to convince us that being part of the British royal family is a terrible burden rather than an immense and unjust privilege. It wants to drive home a message of social justice about representation and diversity in the twenty-first century. And it wants to indict the vicious and profit-oriented media that intrudes on celebrities' privacy. Unfortunately, it's only really successful at the last one.\n\nThe nearly six-hour-long limited series becomes extremely tedious and boring by its second half, as it becomes clear that the two will make no direct criticisms of anyone or anything other than the British media. As far as they are concerned, the world is running pretty smoothly, except for the vulturous paparazzi who are always trying to get in their business, preventing them from doing the good philanthropic work on behalf of the British monarchy that they \"could have spent the rest of their lives doing.\"\n\nThe series begins with an overview of how Harry and Meghan met and fell in love, which is intended to be relatable while not being relatable to very many people at all. (Another totally relatable thing they do is refer to each other by their first initials, \"H\" and \"M,\" instead of their names. This makes them sound more like harried coworkers dashing off a quick email rather than two people planning to spend the rest of their lives together.)\n\nHarry reached out to Meghan after she appeared in an acquaintance's video on social media, they went on two dates in London, and then they video chatted for a month after Meghan returned to Toronto to continue filming Suits , the TV show she starred in at the time. After that, Meghan flew to Botswana, where she and Harry spent an idyllic week together on safari. The two then embarked on a secret love affair of biweekly transatlantic flights. Throughout the series, their mutual love of Africa is offered up as evidence of their good moral fiber and lack of pretense, as individuals and as a couple. (\"For me, [Africa has] always been quite special,\" Harry tells us. \"So it was absolutely critical to share it with Meg.\")\n\nThe time devoted to sketching their childhoods and family backgrounds does a lot of heavy lifting in this regard as well. Harry is presented as a boy who never quite fit into the posh surroundings of boarding school and the royal family. Amid a flood of negative media coverage of his bad teenage behavior, Harry retreats to Lesotho during his gap year, where he can be a normal guy who builds fences and does charity work with Prince Seeiso, apparently. \"Lesotho gave me the space and the freedom to breathe, to live, and to grow,\" he says.\n\nLater, he uses the military as an escape hatch from the pressures of young adulthood. Harry's main personality trait is liking to be barefoot, which is mentioned multiple times during the documentary and proven with constant footage of him walking around outdoors without shoes. What a relaxed man of the people!\n\nTo counteract the racist dog-whistling of the right-wing tabloid media that was part of the deep dive into Meghan's background that accompanied her rise to fame as Harry's girlfriend, the film expends a lot of effort to demonstrate that Meghan had a mostly white, middle-class upbringing in Los Angeles. Countless group photos from childhood flash across the screen, showing Meghan as the only person of color. The documentary seems to say, over and over, \"Meghan definitely didn't grow up in Compton, like some people said. Not that there would be anything wrong with that!\"\n\nIn fact, it kind of seems like Meghan is a little bit of a nepo baby herself. Her dad was a cinematographer and lighting director, and she attended the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse, a private primary school where the annual tuition is upward of $20,000, later graduating from Northwestern University before becoming an actor.\n\nHarry and Meghan's whirlwind romance is presented as being driven by their mutual passion for social justice and philanthropic causes. Harry's choice of Meghan as a partner is characterized as him following his heart over his head, choosing an unorthodox outsider to bring into a pedigreed institution for which people are born and bred.\n\nIt's never addressed that Meghan was, in many ways, an extremely practical choice for a royal partner: a Hollywood celebrity who was already accustomed to public speaking, press appearances, and living a life in the public eye. Meghan retires from acting after they marry - she never really cared about being an actress, the show tells us, she just wanted her voice to be heard! What a perfect fit for becoming a full-time hand-shaker, speech-giver, and money-raiser.\n\nBut, oops. It seems like being part of the royal family is way worse than being a regular celebrity. In fact, it kind of sucks. The scrutiny is unbearable, and the expectation to be perfectly gracious at all times without showing any real emotion is deeply inhuman. More than anything, the documentary shows that Harry and Meghan wish they could just be normal rich people.\n\nThe series is at its worst when it makes ham-fisted attempts to draw links between the never-ending narrative of Harry and Meghan's suffering and broader social themes. The racist online trolling that Meghan experienced is attributed to \"misinformation\" and \"bot accounts\" - which are described, incredibly, as a \"humanitarian crisis,\" as though harassment of celebrities on social media is a problem with the same stakes as fear of vaccines or doubts about the legitimacy of democratic elections. Meghan sharing that she wasn't doing well in the months after giving birth and struggled with her mental health is presented as a brave act that \"resonated for so many people.\"\n\nHarry and Meghan clearly see themselves as cutting-edge changemakers whose very existence in an interracial marriage is radical. When things start to unravel and Meghan becomes the target of negative attacks by the tabloid media, they speculate that it might have been because she was too popular and successful, too much of a threat to the institution of the royal family. \"If you can destroy people who are symbols of social justice , then it's a message to other people to stand down,\" explains Meghan in one of the many painfully self-aggrandizing moments of the documentary. \"If you speak truth to power, that's how they respond.\"\n\nMeghan's departure is described by Harry as the royal family having \"missed an enormous opportunity\" to reflect the diversity of the Commonwealth, which is made up of \"2.5 billion mostly black and brown people\" - as though colonialism is a problem that can be solved by representation. Queen Elizabeth II, who is only ever mentioned in the film in the most glowing and admiring of tones, is praised for having \"fought to keep the Commonwealth together,\" a political association of fifty-six countries that are mostly former colonial territories of the British empire. Several interludes in the documentary give the briefest of overviews of Britain's colonial crimes, but these are always narrated by talking heads, like broadcaster Afua Hirsch and historian David Olusoga, and never commented on by Harry or Meghan themselves.\n\nIt's even implied that Barbados might not have declared independence from the monarchy in 2020 if Meghan had still been an active member of the royal family. The film recalls the disaster that was William and Kate's visit to Jamaica on the Platinum Jubilee Royal Tour of the Caribbean in early 2022, during which they were met by significant republican resistance, while consequently reflecting on Meghan's widespread success and popularity in diplomatic visits to former colonies on behalf of the queen. Harry and Meghan seem wistful as they reflect on the good work they could have done for the royal family (and, while they don't mention it explicitly, the British empire), strengthening ties with former colonies and prolonging the influence of the monarchy worldwide.\n\nMuch of the documentary is devoted to indicting the press and discussing how awful it is to spend your life under the magnifying glass of tabloid media. Harry discusses watching his mother, Princess Diana, suffer the same thing when he was a child, and Meghan talks about feeling suicidal at the point of greatest negative media coverage. These are serious downsides to what might appear as an otherwise charmed existence.\n\nIt's interesting, then, that the two have chosen to put themselves in the limelight over and over, beginning with their March 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey and reaching a peak with the debut of Harry & Meghan , Netflix's most watched documentary ever in its premiere week, with 81.55 million hours viewed by more than 28 million households. The series is peppered with iPhone videos the two have recorded of themselves and their reactions to important moments going back several years, suggesting that they've been planning to go public with their story for quite a while.\n\nPresumably, they're doing it for the money. They reportedly made a deal with Netflix to earn $100 million from the film, which will certainly help make them financially independent from the royal family while preserving the lifestyle they're accustomed to. They're aghast when Harry's family cuts off their security detail in March 2020. In one shot from November 2021, Meghan complains about how long her lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday over their publication of a private letter she wrote to her father has dragged on, while one person curls her hair and another massages her left hand. Recent film clips of the two riding their bicycles in Santa Barbara, California, show them arriving home to a private entry yard where nannies and assistants with blurred-out faces wait to receive them. \"I can do things with my kids now that I would never be able to do in the UK,\" says Harry.\n\nViewers are supposed to celebrate Harry and Meghan's escape from the cold, unforgiving pressures of membership in the British royal family. But Harry and Meghan see no problem with the monarchy as it currently functions, except for its symbiotic relationship with the tabloid media and its lack of diversity. The documentary fails to draw this point out, but in a way, Meghan and Harry's experience is an indictment of the liberal politics of inclusion. They thought they could transform the institution of the monarchy (whatever that means) by diversifying it, but even they realize that they failed.\n\nIf any good comes from tens of millions of people watching these two incredibly boring rich people complain about how hard it is to be royalty, maybe some of them will start to question whether the monarchy should even exist. As Ben Burgis explains , \"The idea that any human being would deserve to have a role within a state institution purely because of their bloodline is offensive for the same reason it's offensive that we live in a world where some people are born into wealth and others into poverty.\"\n\nSo, sure, the British royal family seems mean and unwelcoming, and I don't blame Harry and Meghan for wanting to \"step back\" from a family that was making them unhappy. But the very existence of the monarchy is a paean to hierarchy and inequality, and it can and should simply be abolished. The only downside would be that all the members of the royal family would have to start earning their living through podcasts and Netflix documentaries, and we'd probably hear more from them instead of less.\n\nAmelia Ayrelan Iuvino is Jacobin 's deputy editor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Federal Election Commission decision in 2010, the conservative lawyer had another role: general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, the country's largest national anti-abortion group.\n\nBopp's two interests - flooding the electoral system with undisclosed sources of cash and policing women's bodily autonomy - converged earlier this week after the leak of a draft opinion signaled the imminent end of Roe v. Wade . The tentative majority in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization was signed by five conservative justices, three of whom are direct products of the Right's dark-money-fueled judicial network, and four of whom were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote.\n\nThe plutocratic funding that built up the modern conservative legal movement and effectively produced this anti-majoritarian decision lays bare the antidemocratic core of the court - and the urgency of divesting the robed nine of their extraordinary power.\n\nThe leaked opinion, written by Samuel Alito, an appointee of George W. Bush (a president who lost the popular vote and entered the White House as a result of Bush v. Gore , a 5-4 stamp of approval from an ideologically split court), would overturn the landmark 1973 decision Roe v. Wade and its judicial clarifier, Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), both of which relied on broad constitutional interpretations of privacy and personal liberty.\n\n\"We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,\" writes Alito in the ninety-eight-page draft. \"The Constitution makes no reference to abortion and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey chiefly rely: the Due Process Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nPaying no heed to years of precedent and considerable public support for abortion rights, Alito relies on a constrained, formalistic version of the founding document that protects only the rights \"'deeply rooted in this nation's history and tradition,' and 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.'\" This reactionary view of rights holds under the knife not only access to abortion but other ostensibly settled liberties that broad swaths of the electorate have come to accept, embrace, and rely upon.\n\n\"Justice Alito's draft opinion in Dobbs is a radical repudiation of the Court's earlier libertarian precedents on abortion,\" Samuel Nelson, a professor of political science at the University of Toledo, told Jacobin . \"But [the decision] goes much further than that to suggest that all rights seen in earlier cases as fundamental under the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause like the right to contraception, same-sex marriage, interracial marriage, freedom from forced sterilization, and the right to educate one's children are now subject to reversal.\"\n\nIf the Supreme Court is left unchecked, it will continue to advance the interests of right-wing groups and roll back popular gains.\n\nIn Planned Parenthood v. Casey , Alito's conservative forebearer, Antonin Scalia, argued in dissent that it was wrong for the court to rule on the contentious issue of abortion, insisting instead that \"the permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.\" Decades later, Alito echoed this argument, writing in Dobbs that \"it is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.\"\n\nDemocratic Party leaders also invoked the voters in their response to the leaked decision. In a statement, President Joe Biden said: \"If the Court does overturn Roe . . . it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November. . . . At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe .\"\n\nPutting aside the inanity of conservative justices posing as fans of electoral democracy - Scalia and Alito personally helped gut the Voting Rights Act - the voter solution to the judicial problem falls short. A clear majority of voters have long opposed overturning Roe v. Wade , yet America's anti-majoritarian political institutions have prevented the ruling from being incorporated into law. Just this year, a measure to codify Roe was passed in the House, only to stall in the Senate in the face of the filibuster (and conservative Democrat Joe Manchin). Nor should we trust Biden or the Democratic Party, which has proven much better at using the specter of a reactionary court to bludgeon left critics than actually safeguarding abortion rights.\n\nInstead of pushing a purely electoral solution, we should advocate a wholesale restructuring of the court and its place in American politics.\n\nAs legal scholar Samuel Moyn wrote in his testimony last year to the presidential committee on court reform:\n\nThe problem to solve is not that the Supreme Court has lost legitimacy, understood as the current trust of enough observers, but that it thwarts the democratic authority that alone justifies our political arrangements. It is one thing to insulate and protect interpreters of our Constitution and laws from certain kinds of short-term democratic control. It is quite another to cede the last word over large parts of our national political conversation - not to mention the power to edit and throw out major laws - to less accountable powers and, to add insult to injury, to pretend that doing so is either mandated by our Constitution or essential to democracy.\n\nMoyn suggests disempowering the court by stripping the body of its jurisdiction or requiring that only a supermajority of justices could overrule an act of Congress. Another reform proposal, advocated by legal scholar Jamal Greene, would curb the \"disproportionate amount of power each individual justice wields\" by expanding the court to include each appellate judgeship on the federal bench.\n\nWhatever the precise solution, after the leak of an opinion that would gut precedent upon broadly popular precedent and harm the health and bodily autonomy of millions of people, it is now glaringly obvious that the court cannot continue in its current form. We must plunder the court's power.\n\nBenjamin Morse is a writer who focuses on the Left and the law.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

These include the Academy Award for Best Actor for Lilies of the Field in 1964 - the first black performer to win an Oscar since Hattie McDaniel got Best Supporting Actress for Gone With the Wind in 1939 - a British knighthood in 1974, and the Medal of Freedom in 2009. \"Groundbreaking\" is the most-used word in celebrating the life of Poitier, and no one can deny that he earned it.\n\nBut it would hurt me to think that he's mainly remembered in solemn terms as an important figure because he \"paved the way\" for other black actors to follow, though it's undeniable that he did. As Denzel Washington put it when he got his own Best Actor Oscar for Training Day in 2002, the first black man after Poitier to win the award, \"I'll always be chasing you, Sidney. I'll always be following in your footsteps. There's nothing I'd rather do. . . .\"\n\nBut focusing so much on his historical importance feels rather dutiful, and there's no need to be dutiful about Sidney Poitier. The main thing to remember is that he was a fabulous movie star. He was blindingly handsome, brainy, magnetic, smooth, suave, humorous, and most notably, able to convey a core of serious ethical strength in the face of every kind of attack that made him ideally suited to leading man roles. He had a marvelous glare of righteous fury, and what a voice - a husky, expressive baritone that made for memorable line readings. Just listen to him playing a hardworking handyman ordering a big breakfast after not having a square meal in days in Lilies of the Field - the gravity of his order, with just an edge of gleeful anticipation, dwelling on mounds of eggs, sausages, and toast, and gallons of coffee and orange juice - \"I said fresh squeezed !\"\n\nIt was wonderful to see Poitier humanize himself in films with earthy moments of humor and appetite, because otherwise he could seem almost too good to be true. It's well known that he was the child of poor Bahamian tomato farmers, and he liked to tell the stories of arriving in America with three dollars in his pocket and working as a janitor at the American Negro Theatre just so he could get a foot in the door there. But from the beginning, on film, he always looked like a prince in exile - well, if princes had ever been the superior beings they were advertised to be, that is. So tall, so beautifully proportioned, so graceful, and he wore clothes like a dream. He was godlike even in a white T-shirt and jeans, and no one but Cary Grant could wear a suit with as much effortless distinction as Poitier.\n\nHis very perfections made him useful to the American film industry at a troubled time. The civil rights era of the 1950s and early '60s had Hollywood studios experimenting with attempts to make major movie stars of black talent. Dorothy Dandridge was one briefly successful attempt, and another was Poitier's great friend Harry Belafonte. Poitier would ultimately become the first really major, lasting black film star, not only because of his tremendous charisma and talent, but also because he could believably be cast as the \"Ebony Saint,\" a figure of impeccable virtue and dignity, as in one of his most famous roles, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? Director Stanley Kramer admitted that the strategy of this comedy about a proposed interracial marriage was to present a black man so flawlessly admirable, only a racist could object to him as a son-in-law.\n\nUltimately, the strategy that helped make him a big star increasingly alienated outspoken members of the black community and rendered him obsolete as a leading man by the 1970s, though he went on to a successful career as a director.\n\nIt wasn't well-remembered by critics of Poitier's star persona that he'd actually played quite varied roles in his career. He wasn't always cast as a brilliant, affluent, internationally acclaimed doctor doing altruistic work for the World Health Organization who's also the picture of sensitivity and understanding as a fiancé, as in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? . In Blackboard Jungle (1955), he played a tough high school student who's the ringleader of the juvenile delinquents making the idealistic new teacher (Glenn Ford) wish he'd picked a different profession. In The Defiant Ones (1958), he played a desperate rural convict escaping from prison shackled to a white racist (Tony Curtis). In A Raisin in the Sun (1961), he played the electrifying role he originated on Broadway, as an angry, frustrated working-class family man struggling against all odds to make a better life for himself and his family.\n\nPoitier was a hot contender for stardom from his first role in No Way Out (1950), a film noir costarring Richard Widmark. Writer-director Joseph Mankiewicz saw early on in Poitier many of the qualities that would define his star persona, such as his ability to project a questing intelligence and a moral strength that can withstand tremendous pressure. Poitier was playing the first black doctor at an urban county hospital who has the bad luck to treat a pair of prisoners wounded in a botched robbery, one of whom dies. His brother, a vicious racist played by Widmark, blames the doctor and goes relentlessly on the attack against him. (Widmark, famous for his scene-stealing ability to play scary psychotics in film noir, was actually a kindly ex-teacher who apologized profusely to Poitier after practically every take for all the terrible slurs he had to hurl at him.)\n\nPoitier memorably played intense scenes of anxiety and insecurity in No Way Out , such as when he confesses to his wife the financial and emotional pressure of knowing he's got to succeed as a doctor after she's supported him all through medical school, or conveys his awareness that he has only one real supporter at the hospital - the other administrators will be watching him for every possible mistake. But this was the first of many films in which Poitier endured vitriolic racist attacks , verbal as well as physical, with what would become his trademark burning-eyed stoicism, to the increasing discontent of many in the black community. Poitier said that his own mother, when she finally saw No Way Out , stood up and shouted at the screen, \"Hit him back, Sidney! Hit him back! You never did nothing to him!\"\n\nJames Baldwin reported in The Devil Finds Work that black audiences chafed at aspects of Poitier's onscreen behaviors that seemed designed to placate white audiences. For example, at the end of The Defiant Ones , after the convicts have severed their shackles and become friends, Poitier's character manages to run fast enough to hop a moving freight train that will take him to freedom, but his pal can't make it. According to Baldwin,\n\nLiberal white audiences applauded when Sidney, at the end of the film, jumped off the train in order not to abandon his white buddy. . . . The Harlem audience was outraged and yelled, Get back on the train you fool!\n\nIt was in 1967 that black playwright Clifford Mason wrote an editorial, published in the New York Times , demanding to know \"Why Does White America Love Sidney Poitier So?\" Mason charged that Poitier's entire acting career was demeaning:\n\nIn all of these films he has been a showcase [N-word], who is given a clean suit and a complete purity of motivation so that, like a mistreated puppy, he has all the sympathy on his side and all those mean whites are just so many Simon Legrees.\n\nIronically, 1967 was the year in which Poitier began to make films that seemed to be answering the charges against him. In the Heat of the Night , in which he played Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphia homicide detective assigned to help an out-of-his-depth rural Mississippi cop (Rod Steiger), Poitier's character demands respect from white bigots calling him \"boy\" and worse, saying that where he comes from, \"They call me Mister Tibbs!\"\n\nThe line became part of the marketing of the film, and the title of the sequel to the film, as memorable in its way as the famous slap heard 'round the world. When Poitier as Tibbs was slapped by a white plantation owner he was questioning and immediately slapped him back, the advance word went around that the movie was a must-see for that unprecedented scene alone. Poitier claimed he insisted on his character's violent response to violence in the scene.\n\nAccording to In the Heat of the Night director Norman Jewison, who remained a lifelong friend and admirer of Poitier, some of the behind-the-scenes bigotry was every bit as dramatic as what was happening onscreen. Poitier had initially made it clear that he would not shoot the film, set in Mississippi, anywhere in the South. Poitier's participation in the Civil Rights movement was widely known, and he and his longtime friend Harry Belafonte had suffered threats in the Mississippi Delta when delivering funds to the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1964.\n\nIn deference to Poitier's wishes, most of the film was shot along the Mississippi River but in Illinois. The exception was a sequence set in cotton fields that Jewison needed and couldn't get up north. In the small Tennessee town chosen as the four-day location, it was impossible to get a room for Poitier in the town's only hotel, which bore a sign on the door saying \"Whites Only.\"\n\nThe whole cast and crew had to travel to a nearby Holiday Inn that would accommodate Poitier, but they were still subjected to racist terrorizing by locals who drove there in pickup trucks to shout, honk their horns, and generally raise hell. Alarmed, Jewison assembled the biggest crew members to guard Poitier's room. As Jewison tells it, he assured Poitier, \"Don't worry, Sidney. We got it under control. We'll protect you. Everything will be fine.\"\n\nAnd Poitier replied , \"I got a gun under my pillow, and I'm going to blow away the first guy that comes through that door.\"\n\nThis was happening at the acme of Poitier's acting career. In 1967, three of his most star-defining hits were released: In the Heat of the Night , To Sir, With Love , and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? Poitier's real-life steeliness, had it been more widely known, might have made a difference in his reputation at the time.\n\nThe other major area of frustration in Poitier's acting career involved love scenes, or the lack of them. His tremendous allure as a romantic leading man was handled as anxiously if it were dynamite. For example, in Lilies of the Field , Poitier played a roving handyman named Homer Smith opposite a whole gaggle of nuns who at first enlist his help with a few odd jobs but end up demanding that he build them a chapel. Casting him in a narrative with nuns was one of many ingenious ways of preventing Poitier from onscreen romances or physical interactions between himself and any attractive costars. The Slender Thread , for example, features Poitier as a college student volunteering to man a suicide hotline, trying to save the life of a woman caller (Anne Bancroft) who's taken an overdose and wants to talk to someone before she dies.\n\nEven when it came to film projects with love affairs included in the narratives, Poitier would often be angry and disappointed to find out they were rewritten or edited later to remove any sexual content. A kissing scene between his character and an illiterate, abused blind woman (Elizabeth Hartman) whom he's helping in A Patch of Blue (1965) was cut. The author of the autobiographical novel that was the source material for To Sir, With Love , E.R. Braithwaite, disliked the smash-hit film version because of what he considered its excessive sentimentality, plus the timid way it avoided the romance he'd written about with a fellow teacher, who was white.\n\nAnd even when Poitier managed to play a character with a sex life, as in Paris Blues (1961), about the jazz scene in Paris and two couples embroiled in it, one black and one white, it too was watered down. The source material was actually about interracial couples. Such a cultural context conveys how Guess Who's Coming to Dinner ? could ever have been considered controversial or daring. In its first scene, Poitier and his white fiancée kiss passionately in the back seat of a taxi, gaped at by the astonished taxi driver.\n\nBut even if you made Poitier's characters celibate in movies, there was no way to make him less gorgeous than he was. It's a particular pleasure now to go back and look at Poitier's films, outside of the crucible of his own time of major stardom, just to watch how easily he controls the screen, and to linger over his dazzling gifts. A number of his major films, such as Lilies of the Field and To Sir, With Love , might represent peak sentimental liberalism, but they're also riveting as star vehicles. And now that the issue of Poitier's \"perfect\" star image is a less fraught and painful one, if only because he \"paved the way\" for a number of black Hollywood stars representing a much wider range of human behaviors and characteristics including all their faults and frailties, we can revel in his rare exquisiteness.\n\nEileen Jones is a film critic at Jacobin and author of Filmsuck, USA .

Though the decisions present risks to some important policies, the attack on executive power need not jeopardize the Left's major initiatives.\n\nThe US Supreme Court on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on June 26, 2024. (Craig Hudson / the Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAs the Supreme Court's 2023-24 term comes to an end, we have been inundated with decisions on a bewildering variety of subjects. Some of the most controversial involved unprecedented questions, such as: Can a state ban a presidential candidate from the ballot under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment? ( No .) Does a former president enjoy some legal immunity from prosecution related to \"official acts\" when he was in office? ( Yes .) Can a local jurisdiction essentially criminalize homelessness? ( Yes again.)\n\nYet beyond these unprecedented questions, this term also indicated - at least for now - a shift in which goals are being pursued by the conservative legal movement and how. In particular, the court stepped back from some of the \"culture war\" issues that it has ventured into in recent years and stepped deeper into more obscure but potentially more dangerous and consequential questions surrounding the regulatory powers of the federal government.\n\nSince 2022, the Supreme Court has issued monumental decisions overturning the right to abortion guaranteed in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey , expanding the Second Amendment right to carry concealed firearms, and invalidating the use of racial classifications in college admissions.\n\nAs expected, these decisions galvanized the conservative legal movement. Soon after they came down, the federal courts heard challenges to the nationwide legality of the most widely used abortion pill in the country (Mifepristone), to a federal law prohibiting people with domestic violence restraining orders from carrying firearms , and to a race-conscious admissions policy at Thomas Jefferson High School, a prestigious magnet high school in Virginia (this latter case actually began before the Supreme Court's 2023 affirmative action decision regarding Harvard and the University of North Carolina). Each of these challenges made their way to the Supreme Court last year.\n\nTo the surprise, perhaps, of those who see the Supreme Court as a leading foot soldier on the conservative side of the culture war, these challenges were decisively dismissed by the court.\n\nThe abortion pill case , Food and Drug Administration v. The Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine , resulted in a unanimous opinion (decided on June 13 this year) stating that a group of \"concerned doctors\" had no standing to seek a judicial rollback of any of the Food and Drug Administration's authorizations of Mifepristone because the doctors were obviously not directly injured by the mere existence of the drug - which, in any event, they never prescribed and no one forced them to prescribe.\n\nThe challenge to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8), which requires the disarmament of individuals with domestic violence restraining orders, was defeated by an 8-1 margin on June 21. Finally, the court announced back on February 23 that it would not even agree to hear the challenge to the race-conscious admissions policy at the high school in Virginia, leaving in place a Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling upholding the policy.\n\nWhile the court backed away from these culture war issues this term, it stepped further into what has been called the conservative war on the administrative state . This \"war,\" in short, involves an effort to have the courts limit the powers of federal government agencies, with potentially grave consequences for the future of environmental and economic regulations.\n\nSince at least the 1980s, conservative commentators, legal scholars, and judges have argued that much of the administrative state violates the Constitution's separation of powers and basic principles of democracy because it involves unelected executive branch officials wielding quasi-legislative authority. Funders of this campaign - chief among them the petrochemicals oligarch Charles Koch - want to strip away, for good, the very minimal constraints that government has placed on their power.\n\nThe administrative state decision that probably received the most media attention this term was a consolidated opinion on two cases - Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce and Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo - which overturned something known as \" Chevron deference .\" Chevron deference comes from what, at the time, was a relatively uncontroversial (and 9-0) 1984 case called Chevron USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council . Chevron held that, when a statute is ambiguous, courts should defer to a federal agency's interpretation of its own authority under that statute.\n\nOver time, many ( but not all ) conservatives have criticized Chevron deference for making federal agencies laws unto themselves, for perversely encouraging Congress to pass ambiguous statutes, and for stripping the courts of their proper role in interpreting the laws. Liberals, on the other hand, have defended Chevron deference as a necessary benefit of the doubt given to experts working in federal agencies, whose work would be very difficult indeed if they were constantly undermined by judges who have no real idea how, for example, to regulate the stock market or to protect endangered species. Unsurprisingly, in Raimondo, the court's six conservative and three liberal justices took these divergent positions.\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan argued that the death of Chevron deference is tantamount to the death of the administrative state. Liberal media commentators have adopted a similarly grave tone . The reality is that, on its own, Raimondo is not quite so disruptive. For one thing, it explicitly refused to overrule any other cases that relied on Chevron . Moreover, Chevron has, for some time now, been approaching the status of what David French and Sarah Isgur (paraphrasing Antonin Scalia) call \" zombie precedent \": technically still good law, but generally avoided and almost never invoked by the Supreme Court - neither living nor dead.\n\nYet if Raimondo is viewed alongside other cases decided this term, Justice Kagan's apparent alarmism makes more sense. In Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the court (in another 6-3 divide) held that the six-year statute of limitations for suing federal agencies \"begins to run only when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action\" - not when a regulation is issued. As a result, newly created businesses can potentially bring lawsuits against regulations first issued decades ago.\n\nMore significantly, in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy (again, 6-3), the court found \"that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s routine practice of imposing fines in its administrative proceedings, used to penalize securities fraud, violates the Seventh Amendment 'right of trial by jury' in all 'suits at common law.'\" This means that not only the SEC - but numerous other federal agencies that impose fines - could be deprived of an enforcement mechanism and an important source of their own revenue.\n\nThese decisions come after two previous terms in which the court also curtailed the administrative state by invalidating agency actions with \"vast economic and social significance,\" including the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan and the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan. The court argued that such \"major questions\" require specific authorizations from Congress. In theory, this sounds logical; in practice, it inhibits Congress's ability to delegate and ensures that \"major questions\" get thrown back to Congress, where they will usually die.\n\nThe court is not out of the culture war. The lower courts have been flooded with challenges to race-conscious admissions policies in the aftermath of the court's 2023 affirmative action decision; the Supreme Court cannot avoid these cases forever. The court's decisive repudiation of Roe and Casey in the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision should keep it away from any future questions about a constitutional right to abortion, but it already had to rather awkwardly dodge a case from Idaho this term, which argued that near-total state abortion bans violate the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The court will definitely hear more gun control cases: it has already agreed to hear one about \" ghost guns ,\" and sooner or later it will hear one about assault weapons bans . On a different culture war front, the court has also agreed to hear a case next term related to state bans on gender affirming care for minors.\n\nYet what does seem to be clear is that the court is not planning - as many commentators and the liberal justices on the court predicted after the Dobbs decision - a complete return to the cultural norms of the 1950s by overturning its precedents protecting gay marriage, consensual sex for purposes other than procreation, contraception, or even interracial marriage. No such cases are being heard in the lower courts, and no one in the conservative legal movement seems to be interested in bringing them. The administrative state cases, on the other hand, emerge from long-standing plans in the conservative legal movement and keep expanding, term after term, in their scope and reach.\n\nTo be sure, the court's decisions in these cases can be defended on various grounds. The conservatives who criticize the administrative state could even find some common ground with leftists who are skeptical of detached technocracy or of an overly powerful executive branch. But the issue is not about the virtues or vices of the administrative state. It is about the risks of an even less democratic institution - an unelected clique of Yale and Harvard graduates - making these judgements for us.\n\nFor the Left, these risks are serious, but not quite as disastrous as the liberal justices on the Supreme Court would have us believe. The war on the administrative state will definitely constrain what can be achieved through executive action, which has often been necessary to cut through congressional gridlock and deliver important victories such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) plan , the nationwide COVID-19 eviction moratorium , and stricter enforcement of antitrust laws. It will also essentially give the conservative legal movement - which controls not only the Supreme Court but also, thanks Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, the nation's district and appeals courts - license to chisel away at regulations or agencies that it doesn't like.\n\nNevertheless, the major national policy proposals coming from the Left today could not - even at the best of times - be achieved through executive action or agency regulations. Because of Congress's dominant role in the constitutional structure, especially its control over the federal purse strings, things like universal health care, expanded labor rights, serious efforts to address climate change, and wealth redistribution would all require legislation. And the constitutionality of such legislation, if it is ever passed, will not be directly imperiled by the court's war on the administrative state.\n\nFor now, then, the best strategy is to call the Supreme Court's bluff: put less faith in and give less power to the administrative state, focusing instead on the struggle for legislation. If the court then mounts a war on progressive legislation, the time may come to declare war on the court, as the Left did in the 1930s .\n\nHarry Blain is an assistant professor of political science at California State University, Sacramento, where he teaches courses on constitutional rights and liberties.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

GOP senator sounds OK with it.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nSen. Mike Braun , R-Ind., was widely condemned Tuesday for suggesting the Supreme Court shouldn't have issued its 1967 ruling that legalized interracial marriage nationwide.\n\nBraun made the remark while ranting to a reporter about Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that affirmed abortion as a right. He argued such an issue should be left up to individual states to decide, not the federal government. This type of \"states' rights\" argument has historically been used to justify racist oppression .\n\nWhen asked if he'd be OK with the Supreme Court leaving the issue of interracial marriage up to states, Braun said yes.\n\nBraun issued a statement later Tuesday in an attempt to quell the significant blowback he was facing.\n\n\"Earlier during a virtual press conference I misunderstood a line of questioning that ended up being about interracial marriage,\" he said. \"Let me be clear on that issue - there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form, at all levels and by any states, entities, or individuals.\"\n\nDon't let his carefully worded response fool you: Braun's statement doesn't actually walk back his argument about states' rights, and Americans should know what his claims would mean in practice.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the right to interracial marriage in its Loving v. Virginia ruling , Virginia had a law on the books known as the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. The law banned race-mixing, including marriage between whites and nonwhites. Breaking that law was a felony punishable by jail time, and the namesakes of the landmark court case, a Black Indigenous woman named Mildred Loving and her white husband, Richard Loving, were given a one-year prison sentence in 1959 for breaking the Racial Integrity Act. Given an ultimatum to serve time behind bars or leave Virginia for 25 years, the couple elected to leave the state. They filed their lawsuit against Virginia several years later.\n\nUnder Braun's logic, states should be fully entitled to pass such laws without federal interference.\n\nKeep in mind: Braun acknowledging that the Constitution prohibits racial discrimination doesn't necessarily mean he opposes outlawing interracial marriage. The state of Virginia argued during the Loving trial that its ban wasn't discriminatory because it applied to both whites and nonwhites. That argument was obviously struck down by the Supreme Court, but it's still a rhetorical trick that allows people like Braun to claim they're against discrimination without actually having to denounce blatantly discriminatory anti-miscegenation policies.\n\nFrom policies that force women to give birth, to measures that outlaw antiracist teachings, to directives that prohibit parents from providing gender-affirming care for their kids, today's GOP is using law as a blunt instrument to hammer out its revanchist vision.\n\nWe should take Braun's initial remarks about interracial marriage as his true beliefs, and as an indicator of where the GOP's assault on civil rights will go if it's unchecked.\n\nRelated:\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

More specifically, GOP senators appear to have some thoughts they're eager to share about the scope of federalism.\n\nThe party's vision was on display a few days ago, for example, when Sen. Marsha Blackburn said the Supreme Court's Griswold v. Connecticut ruling from 1965, which struck down a state law restricting married couples' access to contraception, was \" constitutionally unsound .\" The Tennessee Republican's point, evidently, was that if states want to block access to birth control, they should, as a matter of legal principle, be able to do so without federal intervention.\n\nYesterday, as NBC News noted , another GOP senator took a stroll down the same politically treacherous road.\n\nSen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said the Supreme Court shouldn't interfere with legislation, such as interracial marriage, and should have left those decisions to individual states.\n\nThe Indiana Republican had already fielded a series of media questions in the same interview in which Braun repeatedly made the case for state officials, not federal officials, making their own decisions on a range of policy issues, including abortion rights and marijuana legalization.\n\nAnd so, journalists pressed further about the implications of such a philosophy, asking the GOP senator, \"Would that same basis [apply] to something like Loving v. Virginia , the Supreme Court case that legalized interracial marriage?\"\n\nBraun responded, \"When it comes to issues, you can't have it both ways.\" A reporter soon after sought to clarify matters further, asking, \"So you would be OK with the Supreme court leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states?\"\n\nThe Hoosier added, \"Yes. I think that that's something that if you're not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too. I think that's hypocritical.\"\n\nIt was a jarring exchange for all the obvious reasons: A sitting U.S. senator in 2022 argued, out loud and on camera, that if states want to ban interracial marriages, the Supreme Court should stay out of it.\n\nThe fact that Blackburn balked at Griswold was at least in keeping with recent conservative trends: That ruling established a constitutional right to privacy, which later served as the foundation for Roe v. Wade . Republican criticisms of the Griswold precedent are provocative, but not unexpected.\n\nBut for a Senate Republican to also question the Loving v. Virginia from 1967 is even more extraordinary in contemporary American politics.\n\nAs NBC News report added, it didn't take long for Braun's office to walk this back, saying the senator \"misunderstood a line of questioning.\" I suppose that's possible, though it's a difficult explanation to accept at face value: There didn't appear to be any audio problems during the interview, and the Republican lawmaker had already answered a series of related questions about the same topic.\n\nIndeed, even if one is inclined to believe that Braun was unfamiliar with the specific case name - he's not a lawyer by trade - the reporter asked if he was comfortable with \"leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states,\" at which point he said, \" Yes .\" It's far from clear what it is he might have \"misunderstood.\"\n\nThe more plausible explanation is that Braun was pushed to consider the implications of his own ideology, at which point he made a mistake by accidentally saying what he appeared to genuinely believe.\n\nRelated:\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor. He's also the bestselling author of \"Ministry of Truth: Democracy, Reality, and the Republicans' War on the Recent Past.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Interracial marriage in US hits new high: 1 in 12\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nInterracial marriages in the U.S. have climbed to 4.8 million - a record 1 in 12 - as a steady flow of new Asian and Hispanic immigrants expands the pool of prospective spouses. Blacks are now substantially more likely than before to marry whites.\n\nA Pew Research Center study , released Thursday, details a diversifying America where interracial unions and the mixed-race children they produce are challenging typical notions of race.\n\n\"The rise in interracial marriage indicates that race relations have improved over the past quarter century,\" said Daniel Lichter, a sociology professor at Cornell University. \"Mixed-race children have blurred America's color line. They often interact with others on either side of the racial divide and frequently serve as brokers between friends and family members of different racial backgrounds,\" he said. \"But America still has a long way to go.\"\n\nThe figures come from previous censuses as well as the 2008-2010 American Community Survey, which surveys 3 million households annually. The figures for \"white\" refer to those whites who are not of Hispanic ethnicity. For purposes of defining interracial marriages, Hispanic is counted as a race by many in the demographic field.\n\nThe study finds that 8.4 percent of all current U.S. marriages are interracial, up from 3.2 percent in 1980. While Hispanics and Asians remained the most likely, as in previous decades, to marry someone of a different race, the biggest jump in share since 2008 occurred among blacks, who historically have been the most segregated.\n\nStates in the West where Asian and Hispanic immigrants are more numerous, including Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico and California, were among the most likely to have couples who \"marry out\" - more than 1 in 5. The West was followed by the South, Northeast and Midwest. By state, mostly white Vermont had the lowest rate of intermarriage, at 4 percent.\n\nIn all, more than 15 percent of new marriages in 2010 were interracial.\n\nThe numbers also coincide with Pew survey data showing greater public acceptance of mixed marriage, coming nearly half a century after the Supreme Court in 1967 barred race-based restrictions on marriage. (In 2000, Alabama became the last state to lift its unenforceable ban on interracial marriages.) About 83 percent of Americans say it is \"all right for blacks and whites to date each other,\" up from 48 percent in 1987. As a whole, about 63 percent of those surveyed say it \"would be fine\" if a family member were to marry outside their own race.\n\nMinorities, young adults, the higher educated and those living in Western or Northeast states were more likely to say mixed marriages are a change for the better for society. The figure was 61 percent for 18- to 29-year-olds, for instance, compared to 28 percent for those 65 and older.\n\n'Race isn't real' Due to increasing interracial marriages, multiracial Americans are a small but fast-growing demographic group, making up about 9 million, or 8 percent of the minority population. Together with blacks, Hispanics and Asians, the Census Bureau estimates they collectively will represent a majority of the U.S. population by mid-century.\n\n\"Race is a social construct; race isn't real,\" said Jonathan Brent, 28. The son of a white father and Japanese-American mother, Brent helped organize multiracial groups in southern California and believes his background helps him understand situations from different perspectives.\n\nBrent, now a lawyer in Charlottesville, Va., says at varying points in his life he has identified with being white, Japanese and more recently as someone of mixed ethnic background. He doesn't feel constrained with whom he socially interacts or dates.\n\n\"Race is becoming a personal thing. It is what I feel like I am,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Pew report, more than 25 percent of Hispanics and Asians who married in 2010 had a spouse of a different race. That's compared to 17.1 percent of blacks and 9.4 percent of whites. Of the 275,500 new interracial marriages in 2010, 43 percent were white-Hispanic couples, 14.4 percent were white-Asian, 11.9 percent were white-black, and the remainder were other combinations.\n\nStill, the share of Asians who intermarried has actually declined recently - from 30.5 percent in 2008 to 27.7 percent in 2010. In contrast, blacks who married outside their race increased in share from 15.5 percent to 17.1 percent, due in part to a rising black middle class that has more interaction with other races.\n\nIntermarriage among whites rose in share slightly, while among Hispanics the rate was flat, at roughly 25.7 percent.\n\n\"In the past century, intermarriage has evolved from being illegal, to be a taboo and then to be merely unusual. And with each passing year, it becomes less unusual,\" said Paul Taylor, director of Pew's Social & Demographic Trends project. \"That says a lot about the state of race relations. Behaviors have changed and attitudes have changed.\"\n\nHe noted that interracial marriages among Hispanics and Asians may be slowing somewhat as recent immigration and their rapid population growth provide minorities more ethnically similar partners to choose from. But Taylor believes the longer-term trend of intermarriage is likely to continue.\n\n\"For younger Americans, racial and ethnic diversity are a part of their lives,\" he said.\n\nDivorce trends The Pew study also tracks some divorce trends, citing studies using government data that found overall divorce rates higher for interracial couples. One study conducted a decade ago determined that mixed-race couples had a 41 percent chance of separation or divorce, compared to a 31 percent chance for those who married within their race.\n\nAnother analysis found divorce rates among mixed-race couples to be more dependent on the specific race combination, with white women who married outside their race more likely to divorce. Mixed marriages involving blacks and whites also were considered least stable, followed by Hispanic-white couples.\n\nOther findings:\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "If Clarence Thomas were consistent, he'd oppose Loving v. Virginia\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nIn a concurring opinion to Friday's Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade , Justice Clarence Thomas wrote, \"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.\" The rulings Thomas referred to guarantee the right to contraception, same-sex relationships and same-sex marriages.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, a Black man, is married to Ginni Thomas, who's white.\n\nBut those substantive due process precedents also include Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court's 1967 decision that says that laws banning interracial marriage violate the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. And Justice Clarence Thomas, a Black man, is married to Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, who is white.\n\nUnlike Thomas, the other justices, both conservative and liberal, contended with what Friday's decision could mean for cases that include Loving, and seven mentioned Loving by name.\n\nBut the only African American on the Supreme Court, and the only Supreme Court justice in an interracial marriage, doesn't mention Loving at all. Though Thomas argues that all those other precedents should be reconsidered, he implies by his silence that the one that affects him personally is sacrosanct.\n\nHe doesn't acknowledge that his decision and the decision of his conservative colleagues could theoretically give his own state of Virginia, which had to be forced by a Supreme Court ruling to permit interracial marriages, another shot at banning them.\n\nI'm not the only one who believes Loving seems intentionally left out .\n\nAttorney Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, author of \"She Took Justice: The Black Woman, Law, and Power - 1619 to 1969,\" told me Friday, \"Clarence Thomas is in an interracial relationship that would not be supported under the legal theory he espoused today.\" Not mentioning Loving, Browne-Marshall said, \"makes him a hypocrite. ... The word 'marriage' is not in the Constitution. If he believes in states' rights, he'd also believe in states' right to say a Black man cannot marry a white woman.\"\n\nThe other conservative justices, all of who are white and married to other white people of the opposite sex, apparently found it necessary to describe, either explicitly or implicitly, Loving v. Virginia as a decision they believed was safe.\n\n\"None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion,\" Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion. \"They are therefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.\" Alito argued that abortion was different because it dealt with \"potential life.\"\n\nIn his concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh mentions Loving by name: \"First is the question of how this decision will affect other precedents involving issues such as contraception and marriage -in particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015),\" he wrote. \"I emphasize what the Court today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the over- ruling of those precedents and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents.\"\n\nBut the three liberal justices, retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, argue that Friday's decision does indeed cast such doubt.\n\nThe majority that says those precedents are safe has got to know that future justices won't be bound to anything this court says.\n\n\"The law offered no protection to the woman's choice in the 19th century. But here is the rub. The law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a wealth of other things,\" they wrote. \"It did not protect the rights recognized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and marriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving to marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right recognized in Griswold to contraceptive use. ... So if the majority is right in its legal analysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those matters properly belong to the States too - whatever the particular state interests involved.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's conservative majority, who said those precedents were safe, has got to know that future justices won't be bound to anything this court decides, just as this court didn't let itself be bound by the decision of the court that decided Roe v. Wade. All it would take to end Loving are five like-minded Supreme Court justices.\n\nTrue, banning interracial marriage wouldn't be a popular move. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2015, 17 percent of newlyweds and about 10 percent of married people overall \"had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity,\" and according to Gallup, 94 percent of adults are approving of marriages between Black people and white people.\n\nThen again, polling has nothing to do with Supreme Court decisions. After all, according to Pew , 61 percent of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and the court just overturned Roe.\n\nConservative lawmakers have already said out loud that they're thinking about Loving. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., answered yes this year when asked, \"So you would be OK with the Supreme Court leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states?\" But then his office backtracked and said the senator didn't mean what he'd said.\n\nThomas seems to know what a quandary his own theories put him in. In his dissent in the Obergefell ruling, he called comparisons between gay marriage, which he'd overturn, and interracial marriage \"offensive and inaccurate,\" saying marriage between a man and a woman has a history that gay marriage does not. Entire papers have been written about which way Thomas would rule on Loving, and quite a few people have pointed out if he really believes in originalism - the theory that the text of the Constitution should be interpreted according to the original meaning of the words used - he'd also have to believe that Loving was incorrectly decided and that states have the power to ban his own marriage.\n\nThomas seems to know what a quandary his own theories put him in.\n\nEven if he doesn't want it to be so, Thomas' argument Friday is an argument that, if accepted in whole, would hurt Black people. But Thomas has made a career of swimming against the stream when it comes to laws that help Black people. He lives in his own rigid conservative bubble.\n\nThe question remains, though, whether he'll have the courage to stand on the opinion he published Friday if racists challenge the Supreme Court ruling that made it impossible for states to block his marriage to his wife.\n\nJesse J.

      "text": "Why we need to stop telling women to 'just get married'\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nMarriage is having a moment in American discourse. TikTok videos extol the virtues of being a stay-at-home wife and mother who also feeds chickens, makes sourdough bread and has five children.\n\nMagazines and newspapers are filled with articles and columns exhorting people to just suck it up and marry . Or even offer up marriage as the solution to the inequality in our nation . And these stories are focused on women, because it's young women who are more likely to opt out of marriage and it's older women who are divorcing their husbands .\n\nThe \"just get married\" discourse feels like a tightening rope around women who are already seeing their rights reversed through the rollback of Roe.\n\nRecently, an essay published in New York Magazine's The Cut even argued for marriage as a feminist reclamation. Marriage, as the author described it, is a protectorate, wherein she is taken care of and pampered. It truly sounds nice given the level of exhaustion American women are experiencing, after carrying the weight of cognitive and domestic labor , and doing the work of the social safety net . But it's worth pointing out that gilded cages are still cages.\n\nThe \"just get married\" discourse feels like a tightening rope around women who are already seeing their rights reversed through the rollback of Roe. Women who saw the vast lack of a social safety net during the pandemic and saw America take back whatever advances we made that helped families, while rolling out the war machine. Women are dying because we don't have choices. Still, the answer that is shouted back at us is \"just marry.\"\n\nBut marriage has never been a safe space for women. And any argument that marriage provides comfort and equality under the benevolent protectorship of a husband isn't borne out by the history of marriage - or the reality of it.\n\nEven now, with all of its supposed advantages, marriage can be a trap for women, who are more likely than men to experience physical and emotional abuse in marriage. And nearly 20% of marriages involve violence . In 2021, 34% of female murder victims were killed by their intimate partner, compared to only 6% of male murder victims.\n\nMarriage as an institution has been more about keeping some people out and locking others in. Founded on the laws of coverture, historically in marriage a woman's identity was subsumed under her husband. But, of course, this relative safety of the marital relationship was only afforded to wealthy women. Poor people, the enslaved, queer or disabled people have been historically excluded from the benefits of marriage. Enslaved women , often forced into marriage, only kept those relationships at the whims of their enslavers, and were subject to sexual and racial violence as a result. Today, mass incarceration that targets Black men makes keeping a marriage together harder . Additionally, staying together as a family becomes difficult when the child welfare system targets Black families . And for centuries, until 1967, when the Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court ruling legalized interracial marriage, marriage was a means of policing racial purity. Also, it wasn't until 2014, when the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges, that gay marriage was made equal in the United States. People who are disabled were excluded from marriage because historically they were often institutionalized. Today, people who are disabled are often barred from the institution of marriage because they can lose access to life-saving benefits .\n\nAnd you don't have to look too far back in American history to see how wives were viewed under the law. It wasn't until 1993 that marital rape was finally outlawed in all 50 states.\n\nIn response to these statistics, critics often accuse women of simply choosing to marry the wrong person. As if you can choose your way out of systemic inequality and an institution that was founded on the fundamental loss of personhood. In sum, marriage never has been, nor ever will be, a form of freedom.\n\nIt's tempting, in a world beleaguered by a pandemic, where women still earn less than men, and where there is no affordable childcare, to see marriage as an appealing way of opting out of the ceaseless grind of capitalism. Better to work for a man who loves you rather than \"the man,\" the logic goes. But it's an upsetting logic, presuming that marriage is still the work of a woman, rather than a partnership of equals. Plus, that logic doesn't parse. All it does is economically isolate women. A wife is far more likely to be abused by her husband than a stranger, and stay-at-home moms are more likely to be depressed and anxious .\n\nFreedom isn't found under the guardianship of a marriage, it's found when we are seen as equal partners and given equal opportunities to earn money and control our bodies and our destinies.\n\nIn \"The Second Sex,\" Simone de Beauvoir argued that marriage is premised on a man treating a woman as a person enslaved while making her feel like a queen. She also notes, \"It is more comfortable to endure blind bondage than to work for one's liberation; the dead, too, are better suited to the earth than the living.\" Beauvoir's words feel like a face slap from the past, reminding modern women how long we've been struggling to be free from the unpaid labor of marriage and how much farther we have to go. Freedom isn't found under the guardianship of a marriage, it's found when we are seen as equal partners and given equal opportunities to earn money and control our bodies and our destinies.\n\nPartnership, when executed with mutual respect, can be amazing. But marriage as an institution has never been about a woman's freedom. And it won't be until we have full equality.\n\nLyz Lenz is the author of the book \"This American Ex-Wife.\" She lives in Iowa and writes the newsletter \"Men Yell at Me.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Perry, the battle for marriage equality\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe line of attack has not changed over time. In the 1960s, as people battled for marriage equality, it was decried by critics as \"abominable,\" \"distasteful,\" and even \"revolting.\" Those traditionalists weren't referring to same-sex marriage, but interracial marriage.\n\nIn 1967, one courageous couple, Mildred and Richard Loving, fought for their right to be wed, despite the many, even the religious, who argued against them. It was a battle that took them all the way to the Supreme Court, but the justices serving during the height of the civil rights movement had no trouble coming to a decision.\n\nIn a unanimous ruling, the court struck down the Virginia ban on interracial marriage that had forced the Lovings to leave their friends and family and move to a more accepting jurisdiction. As the ruling read, \"There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.\"\n\nSwap out \"racial classifications\" for \"sexual orientation\" and you have the argument supported by an increasingly large number of Americans.\n\nToday, the Loving v. Virginia case came up again during the Supreme Court hearing, as pro-equality attorney Ted Olson sparred with Chief Justice John Roberts, as Roberts argued that \"the label\" of marriage was the only thing marriage equality supporters were seeking. \"You insist on changing the definition of the label,\" Roberts argued.\n\n\"You could have said in the Loving case, what--you can't get married, but you can have an interracial union,\" Olson responded. \" Everyone would know that that was wrong , that the--marriage has a status, recognition, support.\"\n\nThat's why people like the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has supported marriage rights for same-sex couples for the better part of the last decade, consider marriage equality as a fundamental civil rights issue, not a religious one.\n\nAs he said Tuesday night on PoliticsNation :\n\n\"I've been challenged by friends, I've been challenged by members of the clergy 'We must preach our doctrine.' That's exactly what we cannot do, is govern by our doctrines. We must preach and live by our doctrines, but we must respect others, otherwise they can impose their will, and their doctrines on us. We must have freedom for everyone, or we have freedom for no one.\"\n\nNearly five decades after the landmark decision in the Loving case, opposing interracial marriage seems practically unfathomable. One of the sitting justices on the court is in an interracial marriage.\n\nThe court may not be poised to announce a unanimous decision again , but the shifting tides of the American people may soon mean that those trying to stop the marriage equality battles of today will seem just as out of touch in another five decades.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "How Interracial Love Is Saving America\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nOpinion\n\nBy Sheryll Cashin\n\nAs a descendant of slaves and slaveholders, I embody uncomfortable incongruities - just as America does. In \"Notes on the State of Virginia,\" Thomas Jefferson wrote with anguish about the risks of amalgamation, or interracial sex, to a new nation. Whites were \"stained\" when they mixed with blacks, whom he speculated were inferior in mind and form.\n\nThere was a Strom Thurmond-esque artificiality to this cry for racial purity. Southern patriarchs made an art out of objecting to what was happening under their own noses - or pelvises. As history would prove, human urges, whether violent or amorous, inevitably muddy lines, and master-slave rape and coupling produced many mixed people.\n\nToday, the \"ardent integrators\" who pursue interracial relationships are motivated by love and are our greatest hope for racial understanding. Although America is in a state of toxic polarity, I am optimistic. Through intimacy across racial lines, a growing class of whites has come to value and empathize with African-Americans and other minorities. They are not dismantling white supremacy so much as chipping away at it.\n\nFifty years ago next week, on June 12, 1967, Mildred and Richard Loving won their landmark Supreme Court case, Loving v. Virginia, ending state bans on interracial marriage. Mildred was a homemaker of indigenous and black heritage, cast as a Negro by Jim Crow. Richard was a white brick mason who drag-raced cars with similarly mixed-race friends. They lived in Central Point, a rural hamlet with a history of racial mixing that began in the colonial era, and they were considered felons under Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924.\n\nSuch miscegenation bans were a relic of slavery. When wealthy planters transitioned from largely white indentured servitude to black chattel slavery in the second half of the 17th century, they feared that poor whites who labored alongside slaves and sometimes took them as lovers would rebel with them or help them escape.\n\nMiscegenation laws in as many as 41 states helped to keep these dangerous whites from subverting slavery, and later Jim Crow. As Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in the unanimous Loving opinion, such laws were an instrument of \"White Supremacy\" - the first time the Supreme Court used those words to name what the Civil War and the 14th Amendment should have defeated.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "The Faces of Intermarriage, 50 Years After Loving v. Virginia\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Sheryl Gay Stolberg\n\nMore than two million marriages take place each year in the United States and, increasingly, they are uniting people of different races and ethnicities. Today, according to the Pew Research Center, one in six newlyweds in the United States is involved in a mixed marriage.\n\nThat is a fivefold increase from 1967, when the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling in Loving v. Virginia, the decision that made interracial marriage legal across the nation. Last month, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Loving decision, The New York Times asked readers the question: Has being in an interracial relationship united or divided your family?\n\nNearly 200 people - not only couples, but children of intermarried parents - responded. In those responses, several themes emerged.\n\nMixed marriage in 2017 goes far beyond black and white, and might more aptly be called multicultural marriage.

      "text": "Loving, 50 Years Later\n\nJUNE 12, 2017\n\nCouples shared stories of their interracial marriage, describing the struggles and triumphs in their lives.\n\nThis week marks the 50th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, the landmark Supreme Court decision that invalidated state laws restricting interracial marriage. Recently, we asked readers to share their experiences about being in a mixed-race relationship. We received more than 2,000 stories in just a few days.\n\nMany people expressed profound ambivalence about the categories that drove anti miscegenation rules, while they described how their racial identity - or how others identified them - continue d to shape their relationships and their social interactions. Some wrote about the resistance they faced from family and society, a nd others celebrated the particular richness of their lives. Here are some of th os e stories.\n\nMarried: Medina, Ohio, July 18, 1992\n\n'Luckily we were young, bullheaded and foolish.'\n\nBarb: I'm African-American and my husband is Caucasian. We married when we were 19 and 20 years old and we'll celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary this year. We love that we get to celebrate such a milestone as the Supreme Court verdict celebrates a milestone too.\n\nAfter we got engaged (which was mainly because I was pregnant) my then-boyfriend was asked by one of his family members: \"Do you really love her or are you just trying to tick your parents off?\"\n\nWe learned quickly that we couldn't answer all of the questions that our families had. Luckily we were young, bullheaded and foolish, so we decided not to let other people's issues with our marriage become our own. We had to focus on us. This meant that my husband had to sacrifice some of his relationships for a short season in order to marry me. Thankfully, they have since reconciled.\n\nWe made it a priority to make sure that our kids had friends of all races. Early on in our lives, we hung out with another biracial couple that looked like us, so that our kids saw black moms and white dads as normal.\n\nAs a couple, we learned to be upfront with each other about race. It didn't start that way. Attraction led to confusion. Our life experience and cultural filters created a need for us to learn each other's ways. Like, letting him, when he was my boyfriend, into my dorm room while I was relaxing my hair. I had to let him see me being fully me. Another time when my father-in-law and I went to a country music concert with his favorite artist - that was culture shock! But, it was the music of my husband's experience and it helped me learn more about the people in my family.\n\nIt's taken a long time to learn this, but we believe that our relationship is more important than one of us being right. We don't want race to ever become a wall that divides us.\n\nMarried: Washington, D.C., May 30, 2016\n\n'We learned that sometimes things just take time.'\n\nEileen: I am Taiwanese-American. I moved to the U.S. during high school. My husband is a Florida-born Haitian-American. We both grew up in immigrant households.\n\nFor two seemingly different individuals, we share a love for food, family and passion for social and environmental causes. As much as our relationship seemed normal to both of us, we learned that it wasn't for my parents and relatives. It took a year of argument, tears, anxiety, smiles and patience for my parents to finally accept our relationship. We waited for their blessing before we had our wedding. Unfortunately, my aunt, whom my family is very close to, decided to stop talking to me because she feels ashamed of me. We learned that sometimes things just take time for acceptance.\n\nMarried: Las Vegas, July 19, 1969\n\n'Many in the Black Power movement that my father helped lead for a time came to oppose interracial marriage.'\n\nSubmitted by Chi Bartram Wright, their son, based on his research and interviews with his mother: In July of 1967 - just one month after Loving vs. Virginia - Nathan Wright Jr., chairman of the Black Power Conferences in Newark, met Carolyn May, a blonde Long Island niece of socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built Mar-a-Lago. As a publicist in Manhattan, Carolyn began promoting Nathan's public speaking engagements.\n\nMy parents fell in love at a time when many in the Black Power movement that my father helped lead for a time came to oppose interracial marriage. My parents wed in Las Vegas to avoid attention, but soon found themselves back East defending their hearts to both blacks and whites, telling family, friends, and colleagues, \"Love is colorblind,\" and \"The heart knows no color.\" My mother recalls, \"Very few white people understood why I would do such a thing. And so I lost a lot of friends and family that way. If they had researched Nathan, they would have found out that he was far more educated than they were, generally.\" In his unpublished memoir, my father reflected on those days, \"The black's continuation through in-group marriage would seem to be inadvisable and errant in relationship to God's purpose.\"\n\nIn 1972, my mother completed a Master's degree in Afro-American studies. I was born in August, 1974. Looking back, my mother tells me, \"In the '70s and '80s in upstate New York, we knew we had to keep you in a private school to protect you from a wider society that was not always welcoming.\" Indeed, I faced overt, aggressive comments from other black kids like, \"You're not really black,\" and \"You think you're better than us.\"\n\nThe same month that my parents met, my father testified on Capitol Hill, stating that Black Power \"speaks to the empowerment of human life for fulfillment.\" While Carolyn and Nathan hoped their marriage would provide them with that same empowerment, in reality they were ahead of their time, pioneers for radical integration, at a time when most were still digesting moderate civil rights.\n\nMarried: A small wedding in Cambridge, Mass.; an epic wedding in Sri Lanka; and another, large wedding in Cambridge, 1988 and 1989.\n\n'Race is only one element of difference.'\n\nDavid: I am white - indeed, raised to believe I was whiter than white since, as I was reminded frequently, my ancestors arrived on the Mayflower. My spouse is from Sri Lanka. She identifies as South Asian.\n\nWhen you're a couple, having different backgrounds simultaneously enriches and stresses your relationship. Race is only one element of difference, and, in my experience, a minor one. I'm only reminded that we are a \"mixed couple\" by others, when our appearance triggers some kind of reaction, most often - but not always - love, approval and sometimes what seems like a tiny bit of envy.\n\nWe now live in California, where mixed-race kids are relatively common. Our daughter has had to face the challenges of being biracial. She is accustomed to the consternation she causes when others can't quite figure out \"what she is.\" She is often mistaken for a Latina, and has a traditional Sri Lankan first name that is often mistaken for African-American. But she has risen to meet those challenges, and is a strong, confident person who knows that above all she is unique.\n\nMarried: Tybee Island, Ga. May 18, 2001\n\n'I've learned that most people are tolerant, but that is different from being accepting.'\n\nJennifer: I am a white female, my husband is a black male.\n\nI have learned that not only is \"driving while black\" a real thing, but also that riding with a black male will get you pulled over. I've learned to ignore disapproving looks from older white people in public places. I've learned to expect the surprise on people's faces when I start a new job and put up photos of my family on my desk. I've learned that in a small town that is predominately white, people will use my husband as their proof that they aren't racist because they associate with a black guy. I've learned that most people are tolerant, but that is different from being accepting. While we may have come a long way from the days of the Lovings, there is still a long way to go, especially in the South.\n\nMy husband is a police officer in a large city close to our tiny town. We have frequent heated discussions where I accuse him of being more of a cop than a black man. My older sons were called Oreos in elementary school; they have been racially profiled by police as adults. My teenage son who still lives at home seems to identify much more with the black side of our family and often makes disparaging remarks about things he sees \"white people\" do.\n\nI have cautioned all of them to please be careful when in any situation with law enforcement. I tell them to keep their hands where they can be seen, just say yes sir and don't do or say anything that could cause a misunderstanding. I wouldn't tell them these things if they were white.\n\nHaving children (and nieces and nephews) that are black has caused me to view the world differently than I might have if I'd married someone of my own race. I think I am more enlightened, I think I see things from a perspective I wouldn't have otherwise had.\n\nMarried: Baltimore, June 21, 2015\n\n'For some of them, it was their first interaction with a black person.'\n\nStephanie: I am an African-American woman, born in Ohio and raised in Auburn, Ala., as a Southern Baptist. My husband is Indian, born in New Delhi and raised in Baltimore. He is Sikh and has a full beard and waist-length hair, which he keeps tied up in a turban.\n\nMy friends tried to dissuade me from dating Shah. With deeply concerned voices, they asked me, \"What will people say? What could you possibly have in common?\" After three months of dating seriously, he invited me to meet his family. His extended family from India happened to be in town for their annual trip to the U.S. Imagine, one little black girl surrounded by 20 of his Indian cousins, uncles, aunts and grandparents. It was intimidating, but I held my own, as they fired away questions (about my education, my parents' professions, my hair, my being an N.F.L. cheerleader, my siblings).\n\nAfter leaving that night, my future husband called me almost in tears. His aunts had asked things like, \"Why a black woman? You can find a beautiful, smart Indian woman to marry!\" Surprisingly, the eldest in the family, his grandfathers, Dada ji and Nana ji, were our strongest advocates.\n\nDespite the negative chatter, Shah and I knew our love for one another would sustain us. All has now been forgiven, and the family has a lot of love for me. I learned that they were scared of the unknown; for some of them, it was their first interaction with a black person. Since then they have welcomed me into their homes with open arms. His extended family was present at our fairy-tale wedding, as were my friends. His family in India has made two trips to see us. We drink wine, chat about life, discuss home decor, politics and go shopping. Had Shah or I succumbed to the pressure, we would have missed out on the greatest love of all!\n\nShah and I don't have children yet, but are planning to. We often have discussions like, \"If we have a boy, will he keep his hair and wear a turban like his daddy? What race will our kids identify as? Should we take the kids to both gurdwara and church, or will that just confuse them? How often will we visit family in India? Should we raise the kids in India for a couple years?\" Whatever happens, I'm sure they will be strong like their mom and dad and will be brave enough to handle anything that comes their way.\n\nMarried: Alexandria, Va., August 3, 2013\n\n'We have learned a lot about what it means to be allies.'\n\nOlivia: My husband is white, and I am multiracial. I consider myself to be both Korean and a mix of indigenous, Afro-Caribbean and European descent that characterizes most people from the Dominican Republic.\n\nWe have learned a lot about what it means to be allies since we started dating and especially since we have been married. I remember one night, about two months into our relationship, when we were walking home late from a bar in D.C., we walked by some young African-American men sitting on their stoop. They called to me, and I ignored them because I ignore most men who call to me on the street. They called me a \"chink,\" and I continued to ignore them as we walked on. Then, I felt something hit me - a small rock. They were throwing them at us, and I wondered why. When I mentioned it to Mike, he said he'd flipped them off.\n\nI felt outrage - not at those boys because let's face it, they were kids - I was so angry at Mike. Never, in a million years, would I have felt safe antagonizing those boys by expressing my anger the way that he had. I realized how privileged he was to feel it was O.K. to do that without consequence. I didn't mention it that night to him until after we were married. And when I did, he understood. He wouldn't have understood if I had brought it up when it happened. It took eight years of conversation and real intimacy to bring this evolution about - my trusting him and telling him the story from my point of view, and his vulnerability in hearing it.\n\nMarried: Greensboro, N.C., June 1963\n\n'My husband made a deal with the minister.'\n\nBonnie: When we wanted to get married, my husband made a deal with the minister and told me to not to bring up my race. In North Carolina, it was against the law for my husband (white) and me (Lumbee Indian) to marry. I dyed my hair red to try to fit in with my white friends. No one from either side of the families attended the wedding. And now, the families have no problems.\n\nI've had many incidents of discrimination throughout my life. My mother never trusted a white man until close to her death in 2004, when my husband helped her and he finally gained her trust.\n\nMarried: Boulder County, Colo., November 24, 2004\n\n'I sense disgust and hate from total strangers for the first time in my life.'\n\nAlison: My husband is black and his family is African-American. I'm white and my family is traced to the Mayflower and Eli Whitney. This is a second marriage for us both.\n\nSince we first started seeing each other, I sense disgust and hate from total strangers for the first time in my life. Many white people have told me that my husband looks fierce. He doesn't. We are often placed at the restaurant table closest to the kitchen; white ladies grip their purses and move closer to their companions when we pass. The police stop us for no reason. Today, I pay little attention to prejudiced people. Sometimes we even laugh about particularly racist responses to us.\n\nMy husband, our children and I all feel that the black community is more at ease with us than the white.\n\nThe racism against Obama was plain to us from the start but not to our white acquaintances. The racism surrounding Trump's campaign was obvious to me but not to my husband; he could not take the man's candidacy seriously. My youngest daughter and I rebuked him when he supported Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton at our state caucus, as we perceived her to be the more qualified and only viable choice for minorities. On election night, my husband had taken me to dinner to celebrate Hillary's \"inevitable win.\" When Trump won the Electoral College we left our meals half eaten.\n\nWe have dropped associates that we once tolerated if they are overtly Republican or nonprogressive. We feel paranoid.\n\nMarried: Northampton, Mass., 2006\n\n'This understanding of marriage has deep historical and familial significance for me as a black woman.'\n\nMistinguette: I am black and ethnically African-American. My partner is white and ethnically German-American.\n\nWe are both a \"Loving\" and a \"Goodridge\" family: We have been partners for 29 years but did not marry until 2006, after same-sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts. Our choice to marry was informed by the history of what race and marriage meant to my enslaved ancestors, who struggled to have their antebellum marriages recorded. We have been surprised by the ways that our families are more accepting of us as a same-sex couple than they are about transracial marriage.\n\nChoosing to marry after 17 years of extralegal partnership gave us striking clarity that marriage is not about love or commitment, but a political arrangement about ownership of property and the right to defend it. This understanding of marriage has deep historical and familial significance for me as a black woman that my partner had never had to consider.\n\nMarried: Los Angeles, January 27, 1967\n\n'Our friends thought we were pretty brave, but in reality incidents of prejudice were usually subtle.'\n\nJanet: I am European and my husband is Asian Indian.\n\nWe married six months before Loving v. Virginia. We were in California, where the law forbidding Caucasians to marry Asians was struck down in the 1940s. We and our friends thought we were pretty brave, but in reality incidents of prejudice were usually subtle and relatively rare. That's partly because Asian Indians were so rare in the United States in 1967; nobody knew enough Indians to form an opinion.\n\nWe learned two important things about marrying across cultures: 1) From day one, you'll have to try harder to understand each other; we could never take each other for granted. That gave us a big advantage. 2) Both of our lives were enriched, and the lives of our families as well.\n\nWhen Basab died 50 years after we met, his memorial service was filled with our family and friends from all sides of the globe.\n\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .\n\nProduced by Umi Syam, Liriel Higa and Sara Barrett.

      "text": "Senator Says Legalizing Interracial Marriage Was a Mistake, Backtracks Unconvincingly\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Braun is attempting a rather unconvincing cleanup job after telling reporters on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was wrong to strike down state laws banning interracial marriage in its landmark 1967 decision, Loving v. Virginia .\n\nBraun, the junior senator from Indiana, made his comments during a media call in which he argued that policy issues should generally be left in the hands of state governments whenever possible, especially in the case of abortion.\n\n\"So you would be OK with the Supreme Court leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states?\" a reporter asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Braun answered. \"I think that that's something that if you're not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too. I think that's hypocritical.\"\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nREPORTER: \"You would be okay with the Supreme Court leaving the issue of interracial marriage to the states?\" SEN. MIKE BRAUN (R-IN): \"Yes. If you are not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you are not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too.\" pic.twitter.com/jiVTMOpC01\n\nThat sounded pretty unambiguous! But afterward, Braun's office issued a statement attempting to walk back the comment, suggesting he had misunderstood the question despite having seemingly answered with unblinking certitude.\n\nEarlier during a virtual press conference I misunderstood a line of questioning that ended up being about interracial marriage, let me be clear on that issue - there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form, at all levels and by any states, entities, or individuals.\n\nCould this really have been an honest misunderstanding? Let's look at the fuller transcript , starting with where the reporter first asks about abortion.\n\nFor context, keep in mind that this exchange occurred after a long question-and-answer session, in which Braun repeatedly suggested that states should handle major policy issues when it was practical, even including ones like marijuana legalization that conservatives often prefer to address federally.\n\nReporter: Hi, Senator. You spoke about judicial activism. If the Supreme Court later this year strikes down the right to abortion, would you consider that judicial activism, legislating from the bench?\n\nBraun: I consider it to have been judicial activism when it occurred back almost 50 years ago. So I think this would be bringing it back to a neutral point to where that issue should have never been federalized, way out of sync I think with the contour of America then. This puts it back to a point where, like most of these issues, where one side of the aisle wants to homogenize it federally, it's not the right way to do it.\n\nThis should be something where the expression of individual states are able to weigh in on these issues through their own legislation, through their own court systems, quit trying to put the federal government in charge of not only things like we did navigating through COVID recently, where I think that was misguided, but in general. So no, I think this takes it back to a point where it should have never gotten beyond in the first place.\n\nReporter: Would that same basis [apply] to something like Loving v. Virginia , the Supreme Court case that legalized interracial marriage?\n\nBraun: When it comes to issues, you can't have it both ways. When you want that diversity to shine within our federal system, there are going to be rules, and proceedings, that are going to be out of sync with maybe what other states would do. That's the beauty of the system. And that's where the differences among points of view in our 50 states ought to express themselves. And I'm not saying that rule would apply in general, depending on the topic, but it should mostly be in general, because it's hard to have it on issues that you are just are interested in when you deny it for others with a different point of view.\n\nReporter: So you would be OK with the Supreme Court leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states?\n\nBraun: Yes. I think that that's something that if you're not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too. I think that's hypocritical.\n\nReporter: What about Griswold v. Connecticut ?\n\nBraun: You can list a whole bunch of issues, when it comes down to whatever they are. I'm going to say that they're not all going to make you happy within a given state, but we're better off states manifest their points of view rather than homogenizing it across the country as Roe v. Wade did.\n\nThere are some mush-mouthed bits here and there, but overall, Braun certainly seems to understand what he's talking about, and in fact sounds like a man who has given this whole topic very careful consideration. The first time the reporter asks him about interracial marriage, he says \"you can't have it both ways\" when it comes to states' rights, and that \"diversity\" is the \"beauty of the system.\" The second time he's asked if the court should have let states determine whether or not to ban Black and white Americans from being wed, he says \"yes.\" Finally, asked about Griswold v. Connecticut , the case where the court struck down laws barring contraception, he says that regardless of the issue, he pretty much always believes states should have the right to \"manifest their points of view\" (because we all talk like Instagram influencers now). To his credit, Braun is being extremely clear and consistent. Say what you will about 1950s-style states' rights fundamentalism-at least it's an ethos.\n\nAnyway, it feels like it's been a little while since a conservative politician hastily backtracked in embarrassment over a racist gaffe, rather than doubling down or railing against the fake news for distorting their words. In that way, Braun's cleanup job is kind of refreshing. At least the man, or his staff, is capable of feeling shame.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Race Analogy\n\nPhoto by Sam Yeh/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIs gay marriage just like interracial marriage? If you're against gay marriage, is that the same as racism?\n\nHundreds of Slate readers have made that argument in comments posted over the last few days. They've raised the analogy in the context of a New Mexico couple who refused to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony . That's a complex case . But the race analogy is worth addressing on its own.\n\nIn many ways, today's debate about same-sex marriage resembles earlier debates about interracial marriage. I've drawn this analogy myself . In at least two ways, however, the situations differ. From the discriminator's standpoint, opposing same-sex marriage is more defensible. At the same time, from the target's standpoint, it's more oppressive.\n\nThe central, categorical objection to gay marriage is that same-sex couples can't produce biological children together. Sherif Girgis, Robert George, and Ryan Anderson emphasize this distinction in their recent essay and book , What Is Marriage? My colleague Mark Stern challenged their case in Slate last year, and I agree with his critique. The procreation argument focuses too much on sex and too little on love and commitment .\n\nJust because I don't agree with an argument, however, doesn't mean it's irrational. Marriage has historically been a sexual institution. A rational person can maintain that a relationship between two people categorically incapable of producing children together-that is, two people of the same sex-can't be a marriage. That argument doesn't justify denying them the right to love one another openly, nor does it justify denying them the benefits and honors we bestow on couples for making lifetime commitments. But it can justify a person's refusal to accept a same-sex relationship as a marriage.\n\nThe argument has plenty of problems. We let old people marry. We let infertile people marry. We don't insist that married couples produce kids. We welcome adoption and stepfamilies. Gay couples can have kids using donated eggs or sperm. Many gay people are already raising children, and doing it just as well as straight people.\n\nAll of that is true. But I'd be remiss to omit the rejoinder from George and his colleagues: Sex is a much brighter line than fertility or intention to bear children. It's certainly a less intrusive distinction to enforce.\n\nMany people think that this distinction is important enough to withhold the word \"marriage\" from same-sex couples; I think those people are being unjust and obtuse to the moral reality of homosexual love. But I can't dismiss them as irrational.\n\nI can, however, dismiss as irrational any objection to interracial marriage. Stern points to Ian Millhiser's useful summary of religious arguments that were once made against interracial marriage. They include:\n\n\"Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\"\n\n\"Purity of race is a gift of God.\"\n\n\"[T]he good Lord was the original segregationist.\"\n\n\"God made racial differences as He made sexual differences.\"\n\nThese statements are objectively false. Every scientific review of human history has found that racial distinctions are not categorical and continue to change . People of different races produce kids together all the time. There's no biological basis for refusing to accept an interracial relationship as a marriage.\n\nThat's why, from the discriminator's standpoint, it's more defensible to oppose gay marriage than to oppose interracial marriage. But why confine ourselves to that standpoint? Why not consider the perspective of the person targeted by the discrimination?\n\nFrom the perspective of a would-be spouse, being denied the right to same-sex marriage can be, in some ways, worse. If you're attracted to someone of another race, and the law won't let you marry anyone of that race, you can find someone of your own race to marry. You shouldn't have to do that, but you can. But if you're exclusively attracted to people of your own sex, and the law forbids you to marry such a person, then everything conservatives praise about marriage-the sharing, the happiness, the fulfillment, the solemnity, the respect-is denied to you.\n\nMany useful comparisons can be drawn between between same-sex marriage and interracial marriage. But let's not pretend they're exactly the same. For better and for worse, they aren't.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Richard Cohen's Conventional Racism\n\nRichard Cohen.\n\nCourtesy of The Washington Post Writers Group\n\nThe liberal Internet has been in a righteously indignant tizzy (my favorite kind) today over a new column from Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen (there's even a hashtag, #FireRichardCohen , for ease of expression). Cohen has long been derided for lame op-ed writing and general \" unreconstructed ,\" \" power-worshiping \" bigotry. But many readers and critics, including my Slate colleague Matthew Yglesias , apparently found today's piece -a familiar rehearsal of the resistance Chris Christie, a relative moderate, might encounter during a GOP presidential campaign in more socially conservative contests like Iowa and South Carolina-to be the final, actionable offense. Or at least this paragraph from it:\n\nToday's GOP is not racist, as Harry Belafonte alleged about the tea party, but it is deeply troubled - about the expansion of government, about immigration, about secularism, about the mainstreaming of what used to be the avant-garde. People with conventional views must repress a gag reflex when considering the mayor-elect of New York-a white man married to a black woman and with two biracial children. (Should I mention that Bill de Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray, used to be a lesbian?) This family represents the cultural changes that have enveloped parts-but not all-of America. To cultural conservatives, this doesn't look like their country at all.\n\nThe conventional reaction to Gag-Gate has been to brand Cohen a racist (though, interestingly, cries of \"homophobe\" have been less forthcoming ) and to call for Post owner Jeff Bezos to do some personnel reshuffling. But I'm betting that for many, the conventional process preceding that reaction has involved a less than careful reading of the entire piece.\n\nLet me be clear here-I am not interested in defending Richard Cohen generally against the larger criticisms I mentioned up top. I am definitely not a fan. But I'm also not a fan of a willful-seeming, mob-like misreading of a piece of writing in the service of self-satisfied smugness, especially when the piece- as confusingly written as it is -is worth serious consideration for what it reveals about the troublingly different ways people identify and conceptualize racism in this country.\n\nBefore I get to that, though, let's break down what Cohen actually wrote. The offending paragraph is embedded in a longer segment about the mindless, reactionary social conservatism of Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrats and how nasty their insurgence was for a more moderate Democratic Party back in the 1948 election. Cohen calls the similarities to contemporary tea-partying Iowans \"ominous,\" and warily eyes the trenchant, anti-modern (and politically costly) attitude that can emerge when a group of people perceive their \"way of life under attack and they [fear] its loss.\" Now, it's true that he doesn't condemn this faction as forcefully as he might, but my takeaway from the piece as a whole was that Cohen is none too pleased with what their ascendancy bodes for mainstream conservatism.\n\nOf course, a few highly ambiguous phrases (that probably should have been edited out) in the \"gag\" sentence make this reading harder, but let's try. \"Conventional\" is the most unfortunate word choice, with its connotations of \"common sense,\" \"widely shared,\" or \"unremarkable\"; as many critics have already pointed out, studies show that disapproval of miscegenation is none of those things today . But recall that Cohen has been describing a limited, if still very much extant, mindset that (he at least wants us to believe) is not his own; in that worldview, dislike of interracial marriage is very much conventional, as is dislike of former lesbians-these are literally the conventions of that social group. Tweak your reading from there, and the rest of the sentence feels much less provocative: \"must repress\" changes from \" have to repress because ew!\" to \"Lord, don't you know those people must be repressing\"; even \"gag reflex\" makes more sense. After all, people don't gag when they vomit (that's called heaving); they gag when they feel like something is being forced down their throats-like, um, modern families named de Blasio who in no way resemble the imaginary, white-bread fantasy social conservatives consider to be \"their country.\"\n\nI fully understand that some readers will not be willing to give Cohen the benefit of this much doubt, but can we at least agree, contrary to the glut of knee-jerk posts and tweets out there, that this man did not write \"I, Richard Cohen, am gagging on white penises in black vaginas, the latter of which was previously not into that sort of thing\"? He just didn't. And while the need for this much parsing is a problem in itself, the simplistic feeding frenzy is starting to feel a little silly-and worse, frustratingly unproductive.\n\nRacism and how we define it is an issue worth taking seriously, and if Cohen said anything worthy of criticism in this column, it's his casual claim that the modern GOP, tea party and mainstream together, doesn't have a race problem. Again, the quote:\n\n\"Today's GOP is not racist, as Harry Belafonte alleged about the tea party, but it is deeply troubled - about the expansion of government, about immigration, about secularism, about the mainstreaming of what used to be the avant-garde.\"\n\nClearly, Cohen is making that judgment in comparison to the open racism of the Dixiecrats and exaggerated charges like Belafonte's, in which he accused the Koch brothers of being out-and-out \"white supremacists.\" It's true that the GOP, especially considered apart from the hard-right faction (an increasingly difficult mental feat, I know), is no longer racist in that way.\n\nBut a number of the \"troubling\" issues Cohen then lists as if they were fairly neutral are, in fact, totally charged with racist meanings. \"Expansion of government\" equals entitlement programs for, in sizable part, poor people of color-there is a racist component in the conservative refusal to acknowledge structural inequality. \"Immigration\" equals further demographic/cultural shifts as even more people of color come here to fill necessary but undesirable jobs-there is a racist component to that kind of hypocritical xenophobia. \"Secularism\" equals the decline of the Christian nuclear family and the rise of more single parent and innovative living arrangements, especially in communities of color, the horror at which is, again, partially racist. And finally, the \"mainstreaming of what used to be the avant-garde,\" a particularly arresting formulation, equals a total racist/homophobic freak-out about the fact that people who were long consigned to the aren't-they-amusing margins are now flouncing right on into the center of American life.\n\nCohen is right about one thing: A lot of people (and not only conservatives) in this country are indeed \"troubled\" by these cultural shifts, but because they do not consciously hate black people just for having dark skin, they do not think they are racist. And yet, due to a host of complicated, ingrained cultural prejudices that are much harder to root out, they functionally are. It's that kind of insidious racism-not overt disgust at miscegenation-that is truly \"conventional\" in this country, and it's Richard Cohen who, in spite of an oafish, messy column, provided a rare opportunity to discuss it. Who cares what it takes to make him gag? We have more important things to do with our mouths.\n\nUpdate, 5:25 p.m.: Richard Cohen has revealed to the Huffington Post that neither he nor his column is racist, while his editor, Fred Hiatt, admitted to The Wrap that he should have edited the most controversial sentence more carefully.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "White Weddings\n\nLast week, the Alabama Senate voted to repeal the state's constitutional prohibition against interracial marriage, 32 years after the Supreme Court struck down Virginia's similar ban. Hadn't these archaic laws gone out with Bull Connor? I asked myself as I read the news account. And haven't we been hearing that America has rediscovered the melting pot, that in another generation or two we'll all be \"cablinasian,\" like Tiger Woods?\n\nI talked to the measure's main sponsor, state Rep. Alvin Holmes, a 24-year statehouse veteran who has been trying to overturn the ban for decades. \"The last time I tried was about three years ago,\" said Holmes. \"It didn't get out of committee.\" Holmes credits his success to the last election, in which a bevy of Democrats were swept into office.\n\nH olmes wasn't just tidying up the legal code. In parts of rural Alabama, he said, probate judges still refuse to issue marriage licenses to interracial couples. Holmes explained that some of his Alabama colleagues opposed his measure because they willfully refused to accept that the federal government had the power to override state law-an ideology of states' rights that goes way beyond Newt Gingrich to John Calhoun.\n\nWhen you think about it, it makes sense that some Alabamians found it hard to jettison overnight a 300-year-old custom. Laws against interracial marriage-and the taboos against black-white sex that they codify-have been the central weapon in the oppression of African-Americans since the dawn of slavery. President Abraham Lincoln's detractors charged him in the 1864 presidential campaign with promoting the mongrelization of the races (that's where the coinage \"miscegenation,\" which now sounds racist, comes from). Enemies of the 20 th -century civil rights movement predicted that the repeal of Jim Crow laws would, as one Alabama state senator put it, \"open the bedroom doors of our white women to black men.\" Fears of black sexuality have been responsible for some of the most notorious incidents of anti-black violence and persecution, from the Scottsboro Boys to Emmett Till.\n\nI ntermarriage bans arose in the late 1600s, when tobacco planters in Virginia needed to shore up their new institution of slavery. In previous decades, before slavery took hold, interracial sex was more prevalent than at any other time in American history. White and black laborers lived and worked side by side and naturally became intimate. Even interracial marriage, though uncommon, was allowed. But as race slavery replaced servitude as the South's labor force, interracial sex threatened to blur the distinctions between white and black-and thus between free and slave. Virginia began categorizing a child as free or slave according to the mother's status (which was easier to determine than the father's), and so in 1691 the assembly passed a law to make sure that women didn't bear mixed-race children. The law banned \"negroes, mulatto's and Indians intermarrying with English, or other white women, [and] their unlawfull accompanying with one another.\" Since the society was heavily male, the prohibition on unions between white women and nonwhite men also lessened the white men's competition for mates. (In contrast, sex between male slave owners and their female slaves-which often meant rape-was common. It typically met with light punishment, if any at all.)\n\nIf fears of interracial sex underlay bans on interracial marriage, it was marriage that became the greater threat. Men might rape black women or keep them as concubines, but to marry them would confer legal equality. Thus, over the course of the 18 th century all Southern states-and many Northern ones-outlawed all marriages between blacks and whites. Up through the Civil War, only two states, Pennsylvania in 1780 and Massachusetts in 1843-hotbeds of abolitionist activity-repealed their bans.\n\nT he end of slavery should have made things better. It didn't. In the South, the federal government initially forced the removal of the bans in several states. But when federal troops pulled out, the bans returned, along with a whole complex of new discriminatory laws known as Jim Crow. In the West, 13 states passed new laws against interracial marriage, many of them targeting white-Asian unions along with white-black ones. Only in the North did laws against intermarriage draw real fire, coming off the books in Maine, Michigan, Ohio, and Rhode Island.\n\nStill, even in the most enlightened areas, mixed-race couples faced enormous social stigma. Clerks refused to issue marriage licenses to mixed couples, and ministers often wouldn't marry them. Couples that did marry faced harassment from employers and neighbors. In 1944, Gunnar Myrdal, in An American Dilemma , noted that \"even a liberal-minded Northerner of cosmopolitan culture will, in nine cases out of ten, express a definite feeling against\" interracial marriage. It was, he said, a \"consecrated taboo\" that \"fixed\" the boundary between the races.\n\nT hat changed slowly with the civil right movement, which reshaped the nation's consciousness. In 1967, an interracial married couple named Richard and Mildred Loving brought to the Supreme Court a suit against Virginia, claiming the right to live there. The court sided with them unanimously, decreeing the ban unconstitutional under the 14 th Amendment. The fortuitously named Loving decision took its place in law books, but not necessarily in practice. Where no one had the wherewithal to stand up for it-say, in rural Alabama- Loving was flouted.\n\nPrecisely as white racists feared, desegregation encouraged interracial unions. Blacks and whites began to meet and date, especially on college campuses, which started admitting African-Americans in larger numbers in the '60s and '70s. The next generation saw a surge in intermarriage. In 1963, 0.7 percent of blacks married someone of another race. By 1994, the figure had reached 12.1 percent. The 1960 census recorded 51,000 black-white marriages. Today there are more than 300,000. Attitudes changed too. In 1958, 4 percent of white Americans approved of interracial marriages. In 1994, it was 45 percent. And younger generations are vastly more tolerant than their elders, suggesting these numbers will climb.\n\nOf course, it's hard not to also see the glass as half-or, more precisely, 55 percent-empty. All these numbers may be climbing, but they remain low. What's more, the white-black marriage rate lags significantly behind rates of white intermarriage with other, nonblack races. Among 25- to 34-year-olds, 52 percent of Native Americans and 40 percent of Asians married outside their race, while only 6 percent of blacks did so. The racism that kept Alabama's constitution unchanged has hardly been eradicated. Whether these habits will change on their own, with the maturation of a more tolerant generation, or whether full social acceptance of black Americans will require a concerted governmental effort, is unknowable. In the meantime, we can take only meager pride in achieving a society in which interracial marriage is safe, legal and, alas, rare.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Sonia Sotomayor Just Sounded a Dire Warning About Marriage Equality\n\nThe Supreme Court dealt a blow to the fundamental rights of married couples on Friday in an important and ominous immigration case, Department of State v. Muñoz . Justice Amy Coney Barrett held-over the dissent of all three liberals-that American citizens have no constitutional \"liberty interest\" in living with their foreign spouses, denying them the most basic protections against arbitrary government discrimination. Justice Sonia Sotomayor's fierce dissent condemned Barrett's opinion as, among other things, an unsubtle assault on marriage equality for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nOn Saturday's episode of Amicus , Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern discussed the Muñoz decision and its alarming ramifications for the constitutional right to marry. Their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: This is an important case about immigration law that'll be devastating to a lot of binational families. Yet Justice Sotomayor also used her dissent to sound a four-alarm fire about the future of marriage equality. To start, can you talk about this case on its own terms?\n\nMark Joseph Stern: Sandra Muñoz is an American citizen. She's married to Luis Asencio-Cordero, who's a citizen of El Salvador. They have a child together who is also an American citizen. Muñoz and her husband sought a visa so he could live with her in the United States. The State Department denied that visa and refused to explain why. Muñoz sued and prevailed at the 9 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the Constitution creates a liberty interest for American citizens to live in the U.S. with their immigrant spouses. The 9 th Circuit ruled that the government intruded on that constitutional freedom, and so, at a bare minimum, it had an obligation to give Muñoz a reason for denying the visa.\n\nSo how does Justice Amy Coney Barrett's majority opinion turn this case into an arrow aimed straight at the heart of marriage equality?\n\nWell, to start, the majority ruled against Muñoz. Barrett wrote that, no, you do not have a right to be given the reason for your spouse's visa denial. The majority could have stopped there, but it didn't. Instead, for the first time ever, it held that there is in fact no liberty interest under the Constitution for an American citizen \"to live with her spouse in her country of citizenship.\" The State Department could do anything it wanted because there was no constitutional right at play.\n\nIt's worth noting that the court didn't even need to get into this discussion of marital rights, correct? Justice Gorsuch has an uncharacteristically restrained, un-Gorsuch-y concurrence saying his conservative colleagues didn't need to get that far.\n\nThat's exactly right, because the government has already given Muñoz the reason it denied the visa. It gave her what she asked for! Now, that reason is dubious: The government claimed he had gang tattoos, which doesn't appear to be true, and she contests it. But because it gave her the answer she demanded, this appeal should've been over. Gorsuch says, basically, \"I don't understand why the majority keeps going when Ms. Muñoz has already gotten the relief she sought.\" She would be free to seek the visa again.\n\nBut the majority was hungry to go further, as Justice Sotomayor said in her dissent. The majority wanted to cut back the constitutional right to marry, so it weaponized this case as a cudgel against that right, rather than practicing judicial restraint.\n\nLet's walk through the Sotomayor dissent, because it reads like an elegy for something that isn't gone yet. She starts right out of the chute: \"The right to marry is fundamental as a matter of history and tradition,\" quoting Obergefell . She suggests that the majority is doing something to imperil Obergefell and even breaking a promise it made in the Dobbs decision. What is she mourning?\n\nI think she's preemptively mourning Obergefell and suggesting that it will be the next casualty of Dobbs . Really, there's no other way to read it. She points out that in Dobbs , the majority said it was not undermining \"the right to marry,\" \"the right to reside with relatives,\" and \"the right to make decisions about the education of one's children.\" But the majority's decision undermines all those rights! It takes away an American citizen's right to live with their spouse and their children here in the U.S. And in doing so, it sabotages one of the key aspects of the court's marriage ruling.\n\nSotomayor talks about how Jim Obergefell and his husband could have stayed in Maryland after they got married there, but didn't want-they wanted to go back home to Ohio and live together there. So when the Supreme Court struck down same-sex marriage bans, it specifically said that same-sex couples had the right to have their marriages recognized so they could live together in whatever state they wanted. Same thing in Loving v. Virginia : The Lovings could have stayed in D.C., which allowed interracial marriage at the time, after they got married there. But they didn't want to-they wanted to go back home to Virginia and live as a married couple there. The state wouldn't let them, so the Supreme Court struck down Virginia's ban on interracial marriage. Sotomayor says those principles are enshrined in our marriage precedents. And she sends up this flare to say that marriage is not just about a piece of paper; it's about the constellation of liberties that accompany it. And a big one has always been the right to live together.\n\nJustice Sotomayor seems to zero in on Obergefell for another reason, too-she's worried the majority's decision will have a disproportionate burden on same-sex couples. Why is that?\n\nSo the majority suggests that if Muñoz wants to live with her husband, she can just move to El Salvador. But for many binational, same-sex couples, that option does not really exist. Because one spouse might live in a place where marriage equality isn't legal and where homosexuality might even be criminalized. Sotomayor points out that the majority's rule is effectively discriminating against same-sex couples. She writes that it will punish \"those couples who, like the Lovings and the Obergefells, depend on American law for their marriages' validity.\" Look-the justice does not whip out this rhetoric in any low-level case. She is explaining that the majority reached far beyond the facts here to call into question some of the bedrock principles of the court's marriage jurisprudence to say that the majority is very much open to changing its mind. And is that any surprise? No member of the conservative supermajority joined the Obergefell majority in 2015. It is very much a new court.\n\nIt really does raise all the questions we discussed after Dobbs about what substantive due process was meant to protect, right? How families work, how marriages work, where you live, the ability to travel together. Is there any chance Sotomayor is overreacting?\n\nI don't think she's overreacting. It's all too easy to imagine this court overruling Obergefell in a few years and citing Barrett's decision in this case. The court could easily say, just down the road, that it already called Obergefell into question, and overruling it is the next logical step. I think that's why Sotomayor also hinges her dissent on Dobbs , pointing to false assurances that the court would overturn abortion rights but go no further. We all knew that was bogus at the time. And remember, Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson signed on to this dissent in full. I think all three liberals are ringing this alarm so everyone can see that overturning marriage equality is very much on the table at this Supreme Court.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Loving and his wife, Mildred, pose in this Jan. 26, 1965, file photograph.\n\nPhoto by AP\n\nDuring yesterday's oral arguments over the constitutionality of California's ban on gay marriage, Justice Antonin Scalia claimed that there is \" considerable disagreement among sociologists \" as to whether being raised by a same-sex couple is \"harmful to the child.\" The lawyers arguing the case repeatedly brought up the landmark 1967 decision Loving v. Virginia , which struck down interracial marriage bans. Did supporters of the ban argue that interracial marriage was harmful to children in that case, too?\n\nAbsolutely. The state of Virginia presented two arguments in support of its interracial marriage ban in 1967. The first was that the authors of the 14 th Amendment to the Constitution explicitly stated that they did not intend to strike down anti-miscegenation laws, which were common in the 19 th century. The second argument was that interracial marriages were uniquely prone to divorce and placed undue psychological stress on children.\n\nThe parallels between the two cases are striking. The defenders of California's Prop 8 rely heavily on the work of University of Texas sociologist Mark Regnerus , who argued in a 2012 study that the children of people who engage in same-sex relationships have worse psychological, social, and economic outcomes. (The study generated enormous controversy , and its conclusions have been largely rejected by other social scientists .) In 1967, the state of Virginia's expert of choice was Albert Gordon, whose book Intermarriage: Interfaith, Interracial, Interethnic attacked the adequacy of interracial parenting. According to Virginia's solicitor general Robert McIlwaine, Gordon concluded that interracial marriages \"hold no promise for a bright and happy future for mankind\" and \"bequeath to the progeny of those marriages more psychological problems than the parents have a right to bequeath to them.\" Interracial marriage is so undesirable, McIlwaine continued, that its negative effects can't even be managed. He argued that it \"causes a child to have almost insuperable difficulties in identification and that the problems which a child of an interracial marriage faces are those which no child can come through without damage to himself.\"\n\nVirginia didn't merely critique the parenting skills of interracial couples-the state attacked their very mental stability. Again citing Gordon, McIlwaine claimed that people who have the temerity to engage in interracial marriage have a \"rebellious attitude towards society, self-hatred, neurotic tendencies, immaturity, and other detrimental psychological factors.\" The implication was that these qualities rendered them unfit parents. The fact that the defenders of Prop 8 did not make similar arguments about gay people before the Supreme Court on Tuesday, even though such attitudes still exist, is an indication of how society has changed since 1967. (The language used in the oral arguments is another indication: Both the justices and the attorneys in the Loving oral argument repeatedly used antiquated racial terms like Mongol , Malay , negro , and mongrel .)\n\nThere are a few interracial parenting arguments from Loving that Prop 8's defenders simply could not adapt to their own case. For example, pointing to comments by a University of Chicago professor, Virginia hinted in 1967 that intermingling the genes of different races might result in unknown physical deformities.\n\nIt's somewhat surprising that the attorneys for Prop 8 chose to make the \"bad parents\" argument at all, because it gained no traction in 1967. Justice Potter Stewart pointed out during the hearing that \"one reason that marriages of this kind are sometimes unsuccessful is the existence of the kind of laws that are in issue here.\" Chief Justice Earl Warren apparently found the argument so unconvincing that he barely mentioned it in his opinion striking down Virginia's anti-miscegenation law.\n\nThe anti-anti-miscegenation reformers may have faced a slightly easier road back in 1967 than gay marriage advocates face today. In the 13 years that passed between Brown v. Board of Education and Loving , more than a dozen states repealed their bans on interracial marriage. Today, nine states have approved gay marriage, either by vote, legislation, or judicial decision. Although there is little data on public attitudes toward anti-miscegenation laws in 1967, only 37 percent of Americans supported them by 1972. Nearly one-half of the country still opposes gay marriage .\n\nGot a question about today's news?

      "text": "Get Déjà Vu Listening to Opponents of Interracial Marriage Argue at the Supreme Court\n\nPhoto by Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nJune 12, 2015, marks the 48 th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia , the Supreme Court decision that invalidated interracial marriage bans. Last year, Mark Joseph Stern compared oral arguments in Loving with arguments in Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor , noting that the arguments in defense of gay marriage bans are strikingly similar to those in defense of interracial marriage bans. His post is reprinted below.\n\nForty-seven years ago today, the Supreme Court handed down its opinion in Loving v. Virginia , striking down all interracial marriage bans as a violation of the 14 th Amendment. The famous case has since served as the cornerstone of the legal battle for marriage equality: Gay marriage proponents seized upon Loving's due process and equal protection rationales to make their case at the court.\n\nOpponents of marriage equality, on the other hand, predictably tried to cordon off Loving , insisting that it was more a case about race than a case about marriage. Yet the legal teams dedicated to combatting gay marriage could never quite shake off the lingering legacy of Loving . Compiled below are highlights from oral arguments at the Supreme Court in Loving , side-by-side with arguments from the Proposition 8 and DOMA cases. See if you experience a sense of déjà vu hearing the arguments that didn't work the first time being trotted out for another round of battle.\n\nArgument: The state has a rational basis in keeping (interracial/gay) couples from getting married.\n\nIn Loving , R.D. McIlwaine III, the assistant attorney general of Virginia, repeatedly returned to the idea that its anti-miscegenation laws were perfectly \"rational,\" which would mean that the state had every right to adopt them without judicial interference. Here, he makes the case quite forcefully.\n\nNow here's Paul Clement, defender of DOMA, making a similar argument about rational basis (albeit one couched in more sophisticated euphemisms) in 2013.\n\nArgument: The framers of the 14 th Amendment never expected it to protect (interracial/gay) couples.\n\nLoving 's dual due process and equal protection arguments both spring from the 14 th Amendment, drafted and ratified shortly after the Civil War. Although the amendment was originally designed to protect free blacks, its protections have since been extended to women and, to some extent, gays. Originalists, of course, have no truck with such extensions, and opponents of women's rights and gay rights have long pointed to the amendment's history to make their case.\n\nHere, McIlwaine argues that the Civil Rights Act of 1866-a direct predecessor of the 14 th Amendment, whose protections the 14 th Amendment aimed to codify into the Constitution-was not designed to protect interracial couples.\n\nAnd here is Justice Antonin Scalia questioning-or really, lecturing-Ted Olson about the constitutionality of gay marriage at the time when the 14 th Amendment was adopted.\n\nArgument: The children of (interracial/gay) couples are disadvantaged because of their parents.\n\nMcIlwaine vigorously argued that children of interracial couples \"have almost insuperable difficulties in identification\" that cause \"damage.\" He also notes that biracial children are often referred to as \"the victims of intermarried parents and as the martyrs of intermarried parents.\"\n\nSuch wildly offensive language would never be spoken in the hallowed halls of the Supreme Court today-and, in fact, attorneys supporting Proposition 8 noticeably shied away from insisting that gay marriage is harmful to children. (One possible reason: It definitely isn't .) But during oral arguments, Justice Scalia forced the issue, leading to this deeply awkward exchange:\n\nScalia need not call these children \"victims\"; the phrase \"deleterious effect\" carries his meaning well enough on its own. But while the precise terminology has changed, the arguments themselves have barely shifted. No matter how deftly they dress up their language in polite euphemisms, gay marriage opponents are still stealing directly from the Loving playbook. And it's working no better today than it did 47 years ago.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Supreme Court's Next Target Is Marriage Equality. It Won't Be the Last.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on Friday overruling Roe v. Wade is a devastating blow to individual autonomy and women's equality, a horrific assault on liberty that will inflict unspeakable suffering and death in the states that are already criminalizing abortion. That decision, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , marks the culmination of a decadeslong battle against reproductive freedom.\n\nBut it also constitutes the start of another crusade-an all-out assault on the many other rights that are \"all part of the same constitutional fabric,\" as the liberal justices put it in dissent. With Dobbs , the majority has torn down the entire doctrine protecting gay rights, marriage, and contraception, among other personal liberties. These rights are now in grave and immediate jeopardy.\n\nIn case there was any doubt about this fact, Justice Clarence Thomas spelled it out in his concurring opinion calling on the Supreme Court to overrule Griswold v. Connecticut (protecting birth control), Lawrence v. Texas (protecting same-sex intimacy), and Obergefell v. Hodges (protecting same-sex marriage). Thomas helpfully spelled out the doctrinal implications of Dobbs : Beginning today, every progressive constitutional victory rooted in individual liberty is up for grabs.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nThe basic threat is easy to grasp. For more than a century, a debate has raged over how courts should define the \"liberty\" guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Some say it protects unenumerated rights, but only those deemed \"fundamental\" in 1868 when the amendment was ratified. Others say it also safeguards modern rights which are \"so fundamental that the state must accord them its respect.\" The court relied on this second conception of liberty in Griswold , Lawrence , and Obergefell , as well as other cases like Skinner v. Oklahoma (barring involuntary sterilization) and Loving v. Virginia (safeguarding interracial marriage).\n\nIn Dobbs , though, Justice Sam Alito flatly rejected this vision of ever-evolving liberty: For the court to recognize unenumerated rights, he wrote, they must be \"deeply rooted in the nation's history and traditions\" with a high level of specificity. Many states, he asserted, criminalized abortion around 1868, so reproductive freedom cannot possibly be a component of constitutional liberty. (There are, in fact, many errors and misunderstandings in his historical analysis, but the justice doesn't care.) In Roe , Alito concluded, the Supreme Court created a right that does not exist, deciding a question \"that the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people.\"\n\nThe flaw in this reasoning-aside from its historical dilettantism and cruel disregard for the lives it will destroy-is that it flatly contradicts precedent. In Obergefell , the court explained: \"The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times.\" Thus, the Framers \"entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.\" The Constitution must be read to protect \"intimate and personal decision[s]\" that are \"central to personal dignity and autonomy.\" In short, an \"emerging awareness\" of individual freedom may gain constitutional stature-even when it was not on the minds of the men who wrote the 14th Amendment.\n\nAlito overruled this doctrine in Dobbs . If constitutional liberty really guaranteed \"a broader right to autonomy,\" he wrote, it could also \"license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like.\" These are really \"policy arguments\" on which the court has no \"authority to weigh.\" So unless a right has \"deep roots\" in \"the specific practices of states at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" it is totally unprotected.\n\nWith this conclusion, Alito all but declared that decisions like Obergefell and Lawrence v. Texas (striking down sodomy bans) are next on the chopping block. Yet the justice tried to obscure this fact with empty rhetoric. Abortion, unlike every other purported right, \"destroys\" the \"life of an unborn human being,\" the justice wrote. So \"nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\"\n\nThe dissenters-Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, writing jointly-rebuked Alito's faux assurances with a mix of fury and fear. \"Should the audience for these too-much-repeated protestations be duly satisfied?\" they asked. \"We think not. ... Either the majority does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does, all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid-19th century are insecure. Either the mass of the majority's opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other.\"\n\nThe majority's \"sole reason for overturning Roe and Casey ,\" after all, was because \"the law offered no protection to the woman's choice in the 19th century.\" And \"here is the rub\":\n\nThe law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a wealth of other things. It did not protect the rights recognized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and marriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving to marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right recognized in Griswold to contraceptive use. For that matter, it did not protect the right recognized in Skinner v. Oklahoma not to be sterilized without consent. So if the majority is right in its legal analysis, all those decisions were wrong. ... And if that is true, it is impossible to understand (as a matter of logic and principle) how the majority can say that its opinion today does not threaten-does not even \"undermine\"-any number of other constitutional rights.\n\nDon't believe it, the dissenters warned, when Alito insists the court can \"neatly extract the right to choose from the constitutional edifice without affecting any associated rights.\" That lie is akin to \"someone telling you that the Jenga tower simply will not collapse.\" And even if Alito were telling the truth, law has a way of \"actually following where logic leads, rather than tolerating hard-to-explain lines.\" The dissenters \"cannot understand how anyone can be confident that today's opinion will be the last of its kind.\"\n\nFor good measure, the liberal justices also pointed out that Alito recently joined Thomas' opinion \"lamenting that Obergefell deprived states of the ability\" to \"resolve\" same-sex marriage \"through legislation.\" Moreover, \"those two justices hardly seemed content to let the matter rest: The court, they said, had 'created a problem that only it can fix.' \"\n\nWe know at least two-fifths of the Dobbs majority wants to overrule Obergefell . We also know that Thomas wants to overrule every single decision that rests on constitutional \"liberty,\" because he does not believe that guarantee encompasses any \"substantive rights.\" The only remaining question is whether these justices can attract three more votes. In his mealy-mouthed concurrence, Kavanaugh pinky-promised that overruling Roe \"does not mean the overruling of those precedents\" inextricably linked to Roe . Then again, Kavanaugh also apparently told Sen. Susan Collins that he would not overrule Roe , and look how that turned out. His assurances of restraint, dubious from the start, now ring hollower than ever.\n\nThe conservative legal movement scored its single greatest victory on Friday when the Supreme Court rewarded its relentless assault on a precedent that most Americans thought was settled. That movement will now devote its energy to toppling other precedents that, at this moment, many consider to be sacrosanct, or at least settled. Any statements to the contrary by the court's far-right bloc are not to be believed. Less than four years ago, Kavanaugh told the nation, under oath, that he believed Roe was \"settled,\" then proceeded to unsettle it at the earliest opportunity. No constitutional right favored by progressives is safe from this Supreme Court's wrecking ball.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Alabama Shows Why Civil Rights Shouldn't Be Put to a Popular Vote\n\nPhoto by Francis Miller/TIME/Getty Images\n\nConsider for a moment what would have followed if the Supreme Court had left laws that prohibited interracial marriage \"up to the states.\"\n\nThis is a perfect time for such reflection, as June 12, 2015, marks the 48 th anniversary of the court's historic ruling in Loving v. Virginia , a unanimous decision that struck down the laws of Virginia and 15 other states that in 1967 still prohibited interracial couples from marrying. Loving is of particular relevance right now, with the court soon to decide, in Obergefell v. Hodges , the fate of state laws that deny same-sex couples the freedom to marry. Most important, of course, and as I've discussed elsewhere , is the fact that Loving provides two independent bases for the court to invalidate those laws. One is that they violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14 th Amendment, which guarantees equality under the law to all persons, and the other is that they also deny gay men and lesbians the fundamental right to marry.\n\nBut Loving is also important because it debunks a key argument the states defending their discriminatory marriage laws have made to the court in Obergefell , namely, that marriage equality for same-sex couples should be decided by state voters or state legislatures. According to defenders of these laws, the \"democratic process,\" not the courts, should determine the issue. This argument is wrong-in our system of federalism, the U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and the fundamental rights of minorities are not subject to a majority vote . Loving is an excellent example of why.\n\nWhen Loving was decided in June 1967, nearly one-third of the states in this country prohibited an African American from marrying a white person. That's right, in 1967 . Indeed, it was only 19 years before Loving was decided that the first state court-the California Supreme Court-held that state's ban on interracial marriage to be unconstitutional. And while 14 states repealed their own laws in the intervening two decades, 16 states were still clinging to their interracial marriage bans in June 1967. In fact, it wasn't until the mid-1990s that a majority of Americans \"approved\" of interracial marriage.  These examples alone show why our governmental system wisely does not leave the constitutional rights of minorities up to the whims of a majority vote but instead obliges the courts to step in when those rights are violated.\n\nOf course, there's no way to know how long those 16 states would have continued to ban interracial marriage absent the ruling in Loving , but it's a good bet that in some of them, there was no quick end in sight. The history of just one, Alabama, provides good evidence of that. After the court's ruling, the affected states began to remove the now-unenforceable but still offensive interracial marriage bans from their state codes and constitutions. Astonishingly, however, the remaining years of the 20 th century ticked away and still the Alabama Constitution proclaimed that, \"The legislature shall never pass any law to authorize or legalize any marriage between any white person and a Negro, or descendant of a Negro.\" In 1998, a measure that would have set in motion the repeal of that language \" died in a legislative committee .\" Died in committee in 1998!\n\nMeanwhile, that same year, South Carolina left Alabama as the only state with an interracial marriage ban still on the books, removing its own state constitutional provision by a vote of the electorate. Even so, 38 percent of those voting opposed amending the South Carolina Constitution, preferring to keep the provision that declared, \"The marriage of a white person with a Negro or mulatto ... shall be unlawful and void.\"\n\nIn 1999, the Alabama legislature finally sent to that state's voters a proposed constitutional amendment to repeal the state charter's ban on interracial marriage, although, according to CNN , \"[s]ome members of the House panel reportedly balked at approving the interracial marriage bill until they were assured it would not open the door for homosexual marriages in the state.\" The proposal was adopted by the voters in November 2000, and Alabama thus became the last state in the country to rid its books of a ban on interracial marriage, although, as in South Carolina, a substantial minority of Alabamians voting on this measure - 40 percent - wanted to preserve the ban, unenforceable as it was.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and we find Alabama now fighting tooth and nail to keep same-sex couples from marrying. Although federal Judge Callie Granade (a George W. Bush appointee, by the way) earlier this year held the state's prohibition of same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional, the Alabama Supreme Court ordered the state's probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. While Judge Granade has made it clear that her ruling applies statewide, she has put it on hold pending the decision in Obergefell. Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore (who has a history of constitutional defiance ) has been particularly vociferous in fomenting resistance to Judge Granade's ruling and has even suggested that U.S. Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan should be impeached for having officiated at the weddings of same-sex couples.\n\nWhether same-sex couples in Alabama and 13 other states around the country will continue to be denied the freedom to marry is now up to the U.S. Supreme Court. As Loving shows, this country will always have constitutional outliers when it comes to respecting the fundamental rights of minorities, and that's where the courts come in. In Loving , as it has in many other cases, the Supreme Court fulfilled its constitutional role as the ultimate guardian of those rights. It must now do the same in Obergefell .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What the Respect for Marriage Act does and doesn't do\n\nThe legislation does not guarantee a national right to same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act, which will be signed into law on Tuesday by President Joe Biden, is being celebrated as historic by him and lawmakers of both parties.\n\nWhile the law will guarantee federal recognition of same-sex and interracial marriages, it was passed through Congress essentially as a compromise and as a backstop in case the Supreme Court overruled its prior decisions, which are currently the legal basis for such rights.\n\nHere's what the Respect for Marriage Act (RFMA) does and doesn't do:\n\nA constitutional right to same-sex and interracial marriage is currently guaranteed only by Supreme Court precedent. Every state is required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex and interracial couples according to the 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges and the 1967 ruling in Loving v. Virginia.\n\nIf the Supreme Court were to overrule either of those precedents -- a fear among Democrats and advocates in light of a concurring opinion in the conservative majority's June ruling to scrap national abortion rights -- then the RFMA acts as a limited remedy.\n\nRFMA does not enshrine a right to same-sex or interracial marriage nationwide. That means it does not require states to perform same-sex and interracial marriages.\n\nStates would be free to deny marriage licenses to same-sex or interracial couples if the Supreme Court precedents were overruled. (Justice Clarence Thomas, in his June concurring opinion on abortion, specifically pointed to Obergefell as having been wrongly decided.)\n\nWhat RFMA does do is require the federal government and all states to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages if they were legally performed in the past or are performed in the future in places where they are still legal, including other states.\n\nEffectively, this means that all same-sex and interracial couples who are legally married today -- some 710,000 same-sex couples as of 2021 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau; while about 10% of married households were interracial as of 2012-2016 -- and going forward cannot be denied the civil benefits of their unions in any state if court precedents were to be overruled.\n\nRFMA also offers explicit protections for religious groups with moral objections to same-sex or interracial marriages: They are not required to provide goods or services to the marriages they object to and their tax-exempt status cannot be rescinded for refusing to perform or respect a marriage.\n\nPrior to Obergefell, 32 states prohibited or likely prohibited same-sex marriages, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . Most of those laws remain on the books.\n\nAs was the case with states' abortion laws in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overruled this summer, many of the restrictive state marriage measures would likely snap back into effect if Obergefell was struck down.\n\nIn that case, same-sex marriage licenses may be available in some states, but not others. However, under RFMA, marriages legally performed in one state would need to be honored everywhere.\n\nThe law does not prevent a state from legally challenging Obergefell or Loving -- or the Supreme Court from revisiting those decisions, as Justice Thomas has called for.\n\nThere is currently no legal case headed to or before the court on these issues, however. It's not clear that a sufficient number of justices would have the appetite to heed Thomas' call.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Fifty years ago, marriages between blacks and whites were still illegal in some states. That ended in 1967 when a black woman, Mildred Loving, and her white husband, Richard Loving, fought for their marriage all the way to the Supreme Court, overturning laws prohibiting such interracial marriages across the country.\n\nNowadays, more than one in six new marriages take place between individuals of different racial or ethnic groups, and almost 1 in 4 Asians and Hispanics marry someone outside of their \"group,\" according to data from Pew.\n\nThe rapid increase in intermarriage rates is a direct result of changing attitudes on race. Not only are millenials the most likely to have friends of different races, nine in 10 millenials support the idea of interracial dating and marriage, according to a recent Pew study. Millenials are also the first generation to grow up with a large portion of parents that also support such relationships.\n\nAs a result of immigration and the high number of interracial marriages, almost half (49.8 percent) of children under the age of one were a member of a racial or ethnic minority, according to the 2010 Census.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that everyone is progressive. Try typing into your Google browser \"interracial marriage is...\" and you'll find the most popular suggested results are \"wrong,\" \"disgusting\" and \"a sin.\" Even millenials are still more biased against some groups than others. Only 88 percent of young people saying they'd be \"okay\" with a family member dating a black person, in contrast 93 percent say they would approve of a family member dating an Asian person. And fifty-five percent of people between ages 50 and 64-year-olds say they would be fine with a marriage of any two ethnic groups, while only 38 percent of those ages 65 and older said the same.\n\nEven after their wedding day, some interracial couples still feel they struggle with discrimination from the rest of society. Last week, a mixed race Virginia couple was outraged when the local police showed up at their house to inquire if a white father had kidnapped his biracial daughters.\n\n\"I sat there for a minute and I thought, 'Did he just ask us if these were our kids knowing what we went through to have our children?'\"said their mother, who only wished to be identified as Keana, in an interview with Fox5DC . \"I was dumbfounded.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "House passes historic marriage equality bill\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act passed 258-169, with 39 Republicans voting yes.\n\nThe House on Thursday passed a bill to codify federal recognition of same-sex and interracial marriages , which now goes to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act passed with bipartisan support in a 258-169 vote. Thirty-nine Republicans joined Democrats in voting yes on the measure.\n\nThe legislation passed with cheers and hugs on the floor. Former Rep. Barney Frank, an openly gay Democrat who has long fought for marriage equality, was present for the vote.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Rep. David Cicilline, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Rep. Jerry Nadler and Republican Sen. Susan Collins held a bill enrollment ceremony celebrating the bill's passage.\n\n\"What a great day,\" Pelosi said at the ceremony, thanking her colleagues for their support. \"At last we have history in the making, but not only are we on the ride sight of history, we are on the right side of the future: expanding freedom in America.\"\n\nPelosi, who is leaving her post as House Democratic leader, has said she is \"particularly happy\" the Respect for Marriage Act will be one of the last bills she signs in her role.\n\n\"Once signed into law, the Respect for Marriage Act will help prevent right-wing extremists from upending the lives of loving couples traumatizing kids across the country, and turning back the clock on hard-won progress,\" Pelosi said in a floor speech ahead of the vote.\n\nBiden has said he's prepared to sign the measure after it passed the House. In a statement Thursday, Biden celebrated Congress for taking a \"critical step to ensure that Americans have the right to marry the person they love.\"\n\n\"The House's bipartisan passage of the Respect for Marriage Act -- by a significant margin -- will give peace of mind to millions of LGBTQI+ and interracial couples who are now guaranteed the rights and protections to which they and their children are entitled,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nEnsuring same-sex marriage rights are protected between states became a top priority for Democrats in light of the Supreme Court's June decision to overrule its precedent in 1973's Roe v. Wade guaranteeing a constitutional right to abortion.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas indicated in a concurring opinion at the time that he would like to see the court reverse the 2015 ruling Obergefell v. Hodges guaranteeing the national right to same-sex marriage, which was decided on similar grounds as Roe.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act will not codify Obergefell and set a national requirement that all states must license same-sex marriages. But it will require individual states to recognize a same-sex (or interracial) marriage that was lawfully performed in another state.\n\nThe Senate passed the bill last week, 61-36 -- marking a victory for Democrats during the lame-duck after months of negotiations with Republicans. Twelve members of the GOP voted in support of the legislation.\n\nSchumer at Thursday's bill enrollment ceremony said the issue is personal for many in Congress. Schumer's daughter is married to her wife.\n\n\"Thanks to the tireless advocacy of many -- many in this room -- and the dogged work by many of my colleagues, my grandchild will live in a world that will respect and honor their mothers' marriage,\" he said. \"So yes, this is about millions of LGBTQ Americans in the country but countless other lives of children and families will also be impacted.\"\n\nThe House passed a similar version of this legislation earlier this year, with 47 Republicans supporting it. The Senate version includes new language to ease some GOP concerns about religious freedom.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin, Will Steakin and Gabe Ferris contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

When my grandparents met Justin, my grandmother was cordial but cold. She greeted him and immediately walked away. When it came time for them to leave, my grandparents didn't even acknowledge him. Instead my grandmother looked me in the eye, with Justin standing behind me, and said, 'Tell that guy I said goodbye.'\"\n\nGraham was shocked.\n\n\"I had never seen my loving, hardworking, and wonderful grandma be so hurtful and so racist,\" she wrote. \"After they left I took Justin on a ride to get out of the house. I'll never forget what he said as we drove around town: ' Racism is never surprising but always disappointing.'\"\n\nThe body activist said her future husband explained to her that someone like her grandmother had only been exposed to negative stereotypes of black men.\n\n\"She had probably never looked a black man in the face, let alone had a conversation with him, and now one was in her daughter's home, dating her granddaughter,\" he told her.\n\nBut it was Ervin's actions after that initial meeting that completely turned things around.\n\n\"As if his understanding wasn't generous enough, Justin called my grandmother on her sixtieth wedding anniversary,\" Graham wrote. \"He's not a texter or an emailer; he's a pick-up-the-phone-and-call-you person, and anniversaries are a big deal to him. Afterward Grandma called my mom and said, 'You'll never guess who called me.' And from then on out, she loved him. Loved him.\"\n\nThe experience was typical of Irvin, Graham said.\n\n\"I'm so grateful that happened, and it never would have if Justin hadn't put his hand out there. He always puts love before pride, which is what he did with me,\" she said. \"When I was playing games, he called me out on it. When we began dating, he did it with intention, always asking the difficult questions: 'What do you bring to this relationship?' and 'What role do you see yourself in beyond girlfriend or wife?'\"\n\nA year after they met, Graham and Ervin tied the knot in 2010.\n\n\"Thanks to Justin's constant communication, I envisioned a marriage that was more than just two people loving each other,\" she said. \"And now we have that marriage: a partnership dedicated to building something bigger than ourselves.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

It's a God-given right,\" said Mildred Loving to ABC News 40 years ago.\n\nA demure young woman from Caroline County, Va., Mildred Jeter Loving never desired attention or publicity. Least of all did she ever imagine she would enter the history books when she married her childhood sweetheart, Richard Loving.\n\nIt was 1958. Mildred, a black woman, and Richard, a white man, drove 80 miles to Washington, D.C., to exchange their wedding vows. Shortly after returning home to Virginia, the couple was arrested in the middle of the night for violating the state's law against interracial marriage.\n\n\"I guess it was about 2 a.m.,\" Mildred Loving said in a 1967 ABC News report. \"I saw the lights, you know, and I woke up and it was the policeman standing beside the bed and he told us to get out and that we was under arrest.\"\n\nThat night marked the start of a legal battle that eventually led to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 12, 1967, the landmark decision in Loving v. Virginia legalized interracial marriage across the country.\n\n\"I cannot believe it's been 40 years,\" Loving said in a recent interview with ABC News. \"Things have changed for the better.\" Now 67 years old and a widow, with nine grandchildren and nine great grandchildren, she stills calls Caroline County home.\n\nThe Loving decision struck down anti-miscegenation laws in Virginia and 15 other states. In doing so, it put an end to the last piece of state-sanctioned segregation in the country.\n\nYet for decades after the decision, many states left the unenforceable laws on the books - South Carolina did not remove its prohibitive clause until 1998, and Alabama held on to its ban until 2000. Clearly, even today, a gap remains between what is officially permitted and what is universally accepted. Unsurprisingly, some interracial couples say despite social progress, they still get looks, comments and even hostile threats.\n\n\"I never had any hostility towards the sheriff or the commonwealth,\" said Loving of the night she and her husband were arrested. \"They were only doing their job, but I'm glad it happened. If they never prosecuted us, none of this would have come to terms. So maybe it was meant to be.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Racism is still a big problem in the US, but this trend offers some hope\n\nA White judge tells an interracial couple that \"Almighty God\" placed the races on different continents because he \"did not intend for the races to mix.\"\n\nA US Senator writes a book about the dangers of interracial unions called, \" Take Your Choice: Separation or Mongrelization .\"\n\nA White father is so disgusted after reading a magazine article on interracial marriage that he writes a letter to the editor saying if his daughter even thought of marrying a Black man, \"I would personally kill her and then myself.\"\n\nThese are soundbites from an earlier era, when most White Americans were repulsed by the idea of interracial marriage. It was a time when White judges and politicians talked openly about protecting the \"purity and integrity of the white race\" and the evils of \"race-mixing\" and miscegenation - a pejorative term for intimate relations between people of different races.\n\nThat all began to change in June of 1967 when the US Supreme Court unanimously struck down an anti-miscegenation law in the Loving v. Virginia case. The case concerned the marriage between a white man, Richard Loving, and his wife, Mildred Jeter, a woman of Black and Native American ancestry.\n\nThe Loving case did more than make interracial marriage legal nationwide - it helped spark a mini social revolution. When a Gallup poll first asked Americans about their views on marriage between Black and White people in 1958, only 4% approved. Last year, that number was 94% - an all-time high - with 93% of Whites saying they approved.\n\nThis dramatic shift represents a rare moment of racial progress that's equally embraced by a vast majority of White and Black Americans. But it also begs a question that's rarely, if ever, asked:\n\nWhy have Americans reached a consensus on interracial marriage when other racial issues, like affirmative action and integration, remain fiercely contested?\n\nThat question has taken on new urgency because interracial marriage is back in the news. People across the globe recently celebrated \"Loving Day,\" the 55th anniversary of the Loving decision, which declared prohibitions on interracial marriage unconstitutional.\n\nA recent Supreme Court decision also raised new questions about interracial marriage. Some legal experts warn the same legal rationale the high court's conservative majority recently used to overturn Roe v. Wade in its Dobbs decision could be applied to overturn Loving v. Virginia.\n\n\"To those who say Loving v. Virginia will never be overturned, be cautious and vigilant,\" said the American Civil Liberties Union in a statement after the Roe decision. \"The United States has a long history of criminalizing, surveilling, and controlling Black and brown families and the mixing of races.\"\n\nAny concerns about the durability of interracial marriage, though, may seem far-fetched to some because it's such an entrenched part of American life.\n\nThere was a time when interracial couples and their children had to hide in shame. Not anymore.\n\nAdvertisements today routinely depict interracial couples, straight and gay, along with their children. Biracial public figures such as filmmaker Jordan Peele, NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama are heroes to millions of Americans.\n\nThe advertisers are following demographic trends. People who identity as multiracial increased by 276% over the last decade, according to the 2020 census.\n\nWhen Ketanji Brown Jackson was sworn in last week as the first Black female justice on the Supreme Court, she did so while standing next to her husband, who is White. His race was not even noted in the stories on her swearing-in.\n\nTrump called him 'my African American.' His life hasn't been the same since How 'good White people' derail racial progress Am I racist? You may not like the answer I covered the Rodney King riots. This moment feels different. That's why I'm afraid Coronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions Black America is being hammered by a double pandemic Her father was called 'the most dangerous racist in America.' She wants a different legacy for her son\n\nTrump called him 'my African American.' His life hasn't been the same since How 'good White people' derail racial progress Am I racist? You may not like the answer I covered the Rodney King riots. This moment feels different. That's why I'm afraid Coronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions Black America is being hammered by a double pandemic Her father was called 'the most dangerous racist in America.' She wants a different legacy for her son\n\nSo how did such an enormous shift in acceptance occur?\n\nCNN put this question to several authors and scholars who not only study race but are biracial themselves. One of them is Lise Funderburg, author of \" Black, White, Other: Biracial Americans Talk About Race and Identity .\" Funderburg was born before the Loving decision to a Black father and White mother who married and raised her in Philadelphia.\n\nFunderburg says the difference between attitudes about interracial marriage and other racial issues like voting rights is one word: proximity.\n\n\"You can dehumanize people when they are just abstract concepts to you,\" she says. \"Affirmative action, voting rights-these are issues that you can depersonalize. But you can't depersonalize your cousin's husband at the barbecue who asks you to pass the ketchup. It's hard to dismiss or take a stance against love when it's in your face.\"\n\nThe importance of physical proximity in bridging racial divisions is backed up by social science. There's a name for this dynamic. It's called \" contact theory .\" This term was coined by Gordon Allport , one of the 20th century's towering psychologists. Allport said that racial prejudice against Black people could decrease among White Americans if the two groups had interpersonal contact.\n\nIn one of his most famous studies, Allport conducted surveys of White soldiers who fought alongside Black soldiers during World War II. He discovered that in companies with both Black and White platoons, White soldiers disliked Black people far less than did White soldiers who served in segregated units.\n\nBut Allport found it was not enough for Whites and non-Whites to simply know one another. Other conditions also had to be met, such as personal interaction, equal status and both groups sharing common goals. Allport's findings, which were replicated with civilians in varying settings, proved that hatred and racism stem from lack of contact-or physical proximity.\n\nThere could be another reason why so many White Americans now accept marriage between Black and White people: They don't perceive it as a threat to their status or economic well-being, one scholar says.\n\nOmar Wasow is one of the leading voices on race in America. An assistant professor of politics at University of California, Berkeley, he is the author of a groundbreaking paper that revealed how violent and nonviolent civil rights protests in the 1960s shaped media coverage and influenced voting patterns. Wasow is also the son of a White man and Black woman who met in college and married in 1968, a year after the Loving v. Virginia decision.\n\nWasow says interracial marriage is more widely accepted by White people now because many don't perceive it as a threat to their economic or political power.\n\nBy contrast, many White Americans believe their property values will decrease if \"too many\" Black people - usually more than a handful - move into their neighborhood. Whites move out so often when this happens that sociologists have a name for the phenomenon. It's called \" racial tipping .\"\n\nA similar dynamic takes place in public schools. If more than a small number of Black students enroll in a school, many White parents withdraw their children, fearing they will receive an inferior education or start making lower test scores.\n\nThese are some reasons why schools and housing remain heavily segregated in the US, despite increased racial diversity in many suburbs.\n\n\"Granting legal equality is often easier to achieve than issues that try to get at material or political equality, where there is something quite valuable that is being allocated and people feel not just a loss of some symbol but a genuine sense of a loss of power, or a threat to their material well-being,\" Wasow says.\n\nAn issue like affirmative action is a prime example of that dynamic, he says.\n\n\"Affirmative action is a more demanding ask of a white majority than something like interracial marriage because there's no sense of, if these people get married, I'm denying an opportunity to myself,\" Wasow says. \"Granting people the legal right to marry has no material cost to people who had that right but were denying it to others.\n\n\"There's a sense of status loss and a change in social order, but if people of different races couldn't get married before and now they can, the person who is a bigot doesn't have their wealth threatened in any meaningful way.\"\n\nAlthough interracial couples are more common in the US today, challenges remain for them and their children.\n\nIn 2013, Cheerios pulled comments from its YouTube page after the cereal brand ran a TV commercial featuring an interracial family and their daughter. The ad triggered an onslaught of racist comments , including warnings of \"racial genocide\" and viewers who said they were so disgusted by the commercial that they \"want to vomit.\"\n\nAnd in March, a Republican senator from Indiana said he would be open to the Supreme Court overturning the Loving v. Virginia decision and leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states. The senator, GOP Sen. Mike Braun, later apologized after receiving public criticism, and said he condemned \"racism in any form.\"\n\nSuch reactions come as no surprise to Kaitlyn Wells , an author who is biracial. Wells, 35, was born decades after the Loving decision to a Black man and White woman.\n\n\"I wouldn't exist if it weren't for Loving,\" she says, referring to the Supreme Court decision which paved the way for her parents to marry. \"But the world didn't magically accept interracial couples on June 12, 1967, when the case was decided,\" Wells says. \"There are still people who believe we shouldn't be here.\"\n\nAfter she married recently, Wells posted a picture on Facebook of her father walking her down the aisle. A White Facebook user, apparently assuming she was White and her father was her husband, posted: \"That is sick. Going to be one of these women with a half breed baby and divorced and trying to find probably another white person.\"\n\nWells says she constantly runs into strangers who take liberties to touch her hair or ask her intrusive questions about her racial identity.\n\n\"It's just this constant thing - they want to put you in a box,\" she says. \"They want to be able to figure out who you are and where you come from.\"\n\nWells was so distressed by the treatment she received that she wrote a children's book for biracial kids titled, \" A Family Looks Like Love .\"\n\n\"If I had a book like this when I was a kid, it would have made some of those conversations with my parents a little bit easier,\" she says.\n\nDespite the experiences of people like Wells, it's hard not to be encouraged by the dramatic shift in public opinion on interracial marriage. Not long ago, a Black man could get lynched for flirting with a White woman in public. Today few raise eyebrows at interracial couples.\n\nCould the same dynamic that occurred with interracial marriage shift to other racial issues?\n\nFunderburg, the author, asks similar questions after looking at the recent Gallup poll and considering recent Supreme Court decisions that have gutted the Voting Rights Act and weakened gun control laws.\n\n\"I do think this statistic points to the power of personal experience to dissolve prejudice and to dismantle hate,\" she says. \"But we're looking at this statistic right now in an era when the number of rights that I thought were solid and sacred are being reversed. That drive for a draconian dismantling of a whole range of civil rights is underway in so many realms of America.\"\n\nThis is a question that no contemporary poll has answered.\n\nWhile more White Americans are now welcoming Black people into their families, many are still not willing to accept them in their neighborhoods or in their public schools.\n\nAs long as there is little contact between White and non-White Americans in those settings, the power of personal experience to dissolve prejudice will remain moot. Unless there are more personal relationships between White people, Black people and others in those spaces, we will continue to live with a paradox spawned by the Loving decision:\n\nAmericans' personal lives are more integrated than ever. But in the public realm - when it comes to issues like political power, housing and education - some White Americans are still living by the motto that guided their predecessors in the era before the Loving decision:\n\n\"No race-mixing allowed.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Why Justice Jackson invoked interracial marriage in Supreme Court's historic transgender care arguments\n\nFollow:\n\nThe Supreme Court was more than an hour into its feisty debate over gender-affirming care when Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson invoked one of the most significant civil rights precedents in the nation's history.\n\nA liberal named to the court by President Joe Biden two years ago, Jackson said she was \"suddenly quite worried\" about how the arguments over Tennessee's ban on transgender care were unfolding and she pointed to the court's seminal 1967 decision in Loving v. Virginia that struck down a state ban on interracial marriage.\n\nRelated article Takeaways from the historic transgender care arguments at the Supreme Court\n\n\"I'm getting kind of nervous,\" Jackson said at one point. \"I'm worried that we're undermining the foundations of some of our bedrock equal protection cases.\"\n\nA unanimous Supreme Court was able to wade into a messy equal protection fight back then and arrive at one of the court's most important decisions, Jackson seemed to be saying. Why, then, couldn't it do so now when confronted with one of today's most pressing civil rights issues?\n\n\"I wonder whether Virginia could have gotten away with what they did\" if state officials then had made an argument similar to the one Tennessee put to the court Wednesday in defending its ban on gender-affirming care for minors, Jackson said.\n\nIt was a particularly poignant moment in the argument over Tennessee's law, in part because the question came from the Supreme Court's first Black female justice - who is in an interracial marriage - but also because it subtly tied the transgender appeal to the court's blockbuster decision two years ago to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe court's ruling in Loving rejected the state's arguments for why its ban on interracial marriage passed constitutional muster. The state had said that since the ban applied to both White and Black people, it didn't treat either group differently based on race. It also said the court should defer to the state on the issue given countervailing scientific views.\n\nTennessee's argument for defending its ban on gender-affirming care is similar, Jackson pointed out. The state says its law does not discriminate based on sex because it applies equally to both boys and girls who are seeking to transition. And worrying to Jackson is that several of her conservative colleagues signaled that perhaps courts shouldn't be involved in deciding those complicated issues .\n\n\"It prohibits all boys and girls from transitioning using certain medical treatments, and it doesn't say only boys can do so or only girls could do so,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.\n\nJackson, however, was forceful in her view that there are \"parallels\" between the Tennessee law at issue in the transgender health care case and the Virginia ban struck down nearly than 60 years ago, including in the states' arguments for why it should be given legal deference.\n\n\"Some of these questions about sort of who decides and the concerns and legislative prerogatives, et cetera, sound very familiar to me,\" Jackson told US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration before the high court. \"They sound in the same kinds of arguments that were made back in the day, '50s, '60s, with respect to racial classifications and inconsistencies.\"\n\nHeading into the arguments, progressives sounded the alarm about how far the high court might go in reversing major civil rights jurisprudence that have been part of the American legal landscape for decades.\n\nThose fears were inflamed two years ago when conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's second Black justice who is also in an interracial marriage, suggested that his colleagues should \"reconsider\" major decisions dealing with gay marriage, contraception and intimate relations between same-sex couples.\n\nThomas' concurrence came attached to the court's controversial decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned the constitutional right to abortion the court had established in Roe nearly five decades earlier. Thomas did not mention Loving in his concurrence - an omission that drew notice from many of his critics.\n\nThe Dobbs decision did not rest on the Constitution's equal protection clause, and its author - conservative Justice Samuel Alito - tried to make clear that it would not impact those earlier cases guaranteeing a federal right to an interracial or same-sex marriage.\n\nBut the court's three liberal justices wrote in dissent that the majority's opinion does make those rights vulnerable to attack - a warning that Jackson amplified on Wednesday.\n\nAs the arguments turned toward their conclusion Wednesday, Jackson appeared to recognize that a majority of the court seemed prepared to support the Tennessee law - and, in her view, withdraw from history.\n\n\"I share your concerns, Justice Jackson,\" Chase Strangio, the lawyer representing the transgender youth, said in response. \"That would undermine decades of this court's precedent.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Mike Braun clarifies his assertion that states should decide legality of interracial marriage\n\nIndiana GOP Sen. Mike Braun told local reporters on Tuesday that states should decide the legality of interracial marriage, before maintaining that he misunderstood the questions and condemned \"racism in any form.\"\n\nAsked if he would \"be OK\" with the US Supreme Court leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states, Braun replied , \"Yes, I think that that's something - if you're not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too. I think that's hypocritical.\" Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court decision that legalized interracial marriage in the United States, was decided in 1967.\n\nBraun was then pressed on his view of Griswold v. Connecticut, which found in 1965 a constitutional right to sexual privacy and legalized contraception for married couples. Braun again said that the states should decide matters.\n\n\"Well, you can list a whole host of issues,\" Braun said. \"When it comes down to whatever they are, I'm going to say that they're not all going to make you happy within a given state but that we're better off having states manifest their points of view rather than homogenizing it across the country, as Roe v. Wade did.\"\n\nThe Times of Northwest Indiana reported that Braun \"initially limited\" his claim that the Supreme Court had usurped states' rights over abortion in 1973's Roe v. Wade decision. But when a reporter questioned him on other cases, including Loving v. Virginia, he reiterated his stance.\n\nBraun later clarified his comments, saying in a statement that he \"misunderstood\" the questions.\n\n\"Earlier during a virtual press conference, I misunderstood a line of questioning that ended up being about interracial marriage. Let me be clear on that issue - there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race. That is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form, at all levels and by any states, entities, or individuals,\" Braun said.\n\nIn a brief interview on Wednesday, Braun told CNN that he does not believe interracial marriage should be determined by the states.\n\n\"No,\" Braun said.\n\nHe said he \"wasn't paying close enough attention\" to the earlier line of questioning.\n\n\"Once I got into it, I didn't want to litigate anything other than Roe versus Wade,\" Braun said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.\n\nCNN's Manu Raju contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Study: Interracial marriage, acceptance growing\n\nInter-ethnic or interracial marriages reaches an all time high in 2010\n\nHawaii is the state where the most \"intermarriages\" take place, study finds\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans say they have no issue with intermarriage\n\nForty-five years after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a ban on interracial marriage, the rate of marriage across racial and ethnic lines in the United States is on the rise, according to a new study released Thursday.\n\nAnd while such \"intermarriages\" continue to grow, so too does public acceptance of such unions, according to the study by the Pew Research Center's Social and Demographic Trends project.\n\nThe study has left social media sites abuzz with discussion.\n\n\"Why do people give inter-racial dating so much lip service?\" wrote Tosin Lajuwomi on Twitter. \"You like who you like - black, white, blue, orange.\"\n\nOthers were more reserved about what the report reflects.\n\n\"I look forward to the day when stories about \"inter-racial\" marriages are no longer newsworthy,\" wrote James Burns on the micro-blogging site. \"We have far to go.\"\n\nAbout 15% of new marriages in the United States in 2010 were between spouses of different races or ethnicities, more than doubling the 1980 level of 6.7%, according to the study.\n\nLooking at all married couples in 2010, regardless of when they married, so-called \"intermarriages\" reached an all-time high of 8.4% in 2010, compared to 3.2% in 1980, the study said.\n\nThe study analyzed the demographic and characteristics of newlyweds who differ in race or ethnicity and compared them to couples of the same race or ethnicity. It defines newly weds as couples who married in the year prior to the survey date.\n\nAmong all newlyweds in 2010, 9% of whites married outside of their race or ethnicity, along with 17% of African-Americans, 26% of Hispanics and 28% of Asians - a term that includes native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.\n\nGender patterns in intermarriages vary widely, the study found. About 24% of African-American males married outside their race in 2010, compared to 9% of African-American females.\n\nHowever, the reverse is true for Asians, where about 36% of females married outside their race compared to 17% of male newlyweds. And intermarriages for white and Hispanic people do not vary by gender, researchers found.\n\nIntermarriages also vary by region. In Western states, about one in five people, or 22%, married someone of a different race or ethnicity between 2008 and 2010. That drops to 14% in the South, 13% in the Northeast and 11% in the Midwest.\n\nInterracial dating services have also cropped up online, offering those looking for love an opportunity to find their preferred matches.\n\nA white man identified as Christopher on the website \"Interracial Dating Central,\" said that he saw who would turn out to be his future wife online.\n\n\"Be bold, ladies,\" said Cassandra, an African-American woman and Christopher's wife, according to the website. \"Have patience, and then have nerve when that patience pays off!\"\n\nBecause whites are by far the nation's largest racial group, marriage between whites and minorities were the most common type of intermarriage, even though the intermarriage rate for whites is relatively low compared to other races or ethnicities, the study said.\n\nThe state where most intermarriages took place was Hawaii, where more than four in 10 newlyweds (42.4%) were intermarried. The next highest percentages were in Oklahoma, Nevada and New Mexico, with 26.3%, 25.6% and 25.4%, respectively.\n\nComparing those who \"married out\" to those who \"married in,\" researchers found the median combined earnings of both groups were similar. In one in five marriages of each group, both spouses were college graduates. In both groups, people tended to marry someone of a similar age, with a two- to three-year age gap between husband and wife. Additionally, equal numbers were marrying for the first time.\n\nHowever, there were some differences. White/Asian newlywed couples had significantly higher median combined annual earnings, at $70,592, than any other pairing.\n\nAnd \"when it comes to educational characteristics, more than half of white newlyweds who marry Asians have a college degree, compared with roughly a third of white newlyweds who married whites,\" the study said. Hispanic or African-Americans who married whites tended to have higher educational attainment compared to marriages within their own race or ethnic group.\n\nCouples formed between an Asian man and a white wife topped the median combined earnings list for the period studied, between 2008 and 2010, with about $71,800, the study said. \"During this person, white male newlyweds who married Asian, Hispanic or black spouses had higher combined earnings than did white male newlyweds who married a white spouse.\"\n\nSeveral studies using government data have found overall divorce rates are higher for couples who \"married out,\" the Pew Center said, \"but here, too, the patterns vary by the racial and gender characteristics of the couples.\n\nMeanwhile, about 43% of Americans said they believe more intermarriages is a change for the better within society, while only about one in 10 said it was a change for the worse, the Pew Center said. \"Being a minority, younger, more educated, liberal and living in the Eastern or Western states are all traits associated with those who think more positively about intermarriage,\" according to the study.\n\nMore than one-third of adults surveyed said an immediate family member or close relatives is married to someone of a different race, the study said. And nearly two-thirds, or 63%, said they would have no problem with a family member marrying someone outside their own racial or ethnic group.\n\nIn a 1986 survey, nearly three in 10 Americans said intermarriage was not acceptable for anyone, and 37% said it might be acceptable for others, but not for themselves. Only one-third of the public said it was acceptable for everyone in the 1986 poll.\n\nThe study is primarily based on the Pew Center's analysis of data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Service in 2008-2010 and on three nationwide telephone surveys, the study said.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "On this day in 1967: Loving v. Virginia and interracial marriage\n\nA post shared by CNN Politics (@cnnpolitics)\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published for CNN on April 13, 2017.\n\nA century after the end of the Civil War, more than a dozen states still had laws on the books banning interracial marriage. Enter Mildred and Richard Loving, a Virginia couple whose June 12, 1967, Supreme Court ruling dealt a major blow to miscegenation laws.\n\nThe couple married in 1958 in Washington - where interracial marriage was legal -  then moved to their home in Central Point, Virginia. Weeks later, the local sheriff came into their home in the middle of the night and they were charged with violating several Virginia codes, including one that made it \"unlawful for any white person in the state to marry any save a white person.\"\n\nIt was also illegal for people to leave the state for the purpose of avoiding miscegenation laws, and such marriages were considered \" absolutely void \" in the state of Virginia.\n\nMildred was a black woman, but her New York Times obituary says that she preferred to think of herself as Indian, since her parents were both part Native American. Virginia had different forms of miscegenation laws on the books stretching back to the 1600s, and the state's 1924 Racial Integrity Act defined anyone who wasn't entirely white as \"colored\" - the only exception was made for those who were 1/16 Native American, but even that had restrictions .\n\nMr. and Mrs. Loving pleaded guilty and were sentenced to either a year in prison or a 25-year banishment from the state. They chose the latter , moved to Washington and had three children. In 1967, they were arrested while visiting Virginia. Mildred wrote to the US attorney general - a man by the name of Robert Kennedy - for help, and he referred her to the ACLU .\n\nThe case's path to the Supreme Court was an interesting one, however, since the couple had said they were guilty and had no right to an appeal. The case found itself in the Virginia Supreme Court before landing in Washington.\n\nThe most vital question at stake was whether or not Virginia's laws violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nLet's brush up on the 14th Amendment quickly.\n\nIt's the one that says, in part: \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nPhilip Hirschkop, one of the lawyers arguing for the Lovings, went so far as to call Virginia's rules \"slavery laws, pure and simple\" that robbed \"the Negro race of their dignity.\"\n\nR.D. McIlwaine, arguing for Virginia , tried to make the case that his opponent was trying to read into the Constitution and give it new meaning. He said marriage was a matter for the states to decide. He also argued that \"intermarried families are subjected to much greater pressures and problems than those of the intramarried,\" comparing intermarried couples to polygamists and the incestuous.\n\nThe justices were having none of it, and on June 12, 1967 , they unanimously ruled that the purpose of miscegenation laws was rooted in racism and violated the Constitution.\n\nIt took until 2000 for the final state, Alabama , to strike down its ban on interracial marriage. Richard Loving died in 1975. Mildred died in 2008.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

      "text": "Senate passes bill to protect same-sex and interracial marriage in landmark vote\n\nThe Senate on Tuesday passed legislation to protect same-sex and interracial marriage, called the Respect for Marriage Act, in a landmark bipartisan vote.\n\nThe final vote was 61-36. The bill was supported by all members of the Democratic caucus and 12 Republicans, the same dozen GOP members who backed the bill for a procedural vote earlier this month .\n\nThe House will now need to approve the legislation before sending it to President Joe Biden's desk to be signed into law. The House is expected to pass the bill before the end of the year - possibly as soon as next week.\n\n\"For millions of Americans, this legislation will safeguard the rights and protections to which LGBTQI+ and interracial couples and their children are entitled,\" Biden said in a statement Tuesday evening after Senate passage, hailing it as a \"bipartisan achievement.\"\n\nWhile the bill would not set a national requirement that all states must legalize same-sex marriage, it would require individual states to recognize another state's legal marriage.\n\nSo, in the event the Supreme Court might overturn its 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that legalized same-sex marriage, a state could still pass a law to ban same-sex marriage, but that state would be required to recognize a same-sex marriage from another state.\n\nThe legislation cleared a key procedural hurdle earlier this month, when the Senate voted 62-37 to break a filibuster.\n\nRelated article The fine print of the Respect for Marriage Act\n\nThe bipartisan group, which includes Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Democratic Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, previously said in a statement that they looked \"forward to this legislation coming to the floor.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer cited those five senators for their \"outstanding and relentless work\" on this landmark legislation during a floor speech Tuesday morning.\n\n\"For millions and millions of Americans, today is a very good day,\" he said. \"An important day. A day that's been a long time coming.\"\n\nIn a sign of how much support has grown in recent years for same-sex marriage, the bill found backing from GOP senators including those in deeply red states.\n\nRepublican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CNN's Manu Raju earlier this month that she voted to advance the Senate's same-sex marriage bill due to \"Article 1, Section 3 of the Wyoming Constitution,\" which she read to reporters and includes an anti-discrimination clause.\n\n\"That's why we're called the equality state,\" she added.\n\nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney, meanwhile, said the \"bill made sense\" and \"provides important religious liberty protections.\"\n\n\"While I believe in traditional marriage, Obergefell is and has been the law of the land upon which LGBTQ individuals have relied,\" Romney said in a statement. \"This legislation provides certainty to many LGBTQ Americans, and it signals that Congress - and I - esteem and love all of our fellow Americans equally.\"\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Tuesday.\n\nCNN's Alex Rogers and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Kamala Harris' marriage could challenge a racial taboo\n\nNikki Buskirk was watching vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff wave to supporters at an Election Night celebration in November when the future second gentleman did something that made Buskirk glow with admiration.\n\nThe couple had just taken the stage in downtown Wilmington, Delaware, when red, white, and blue fireworks suddenly exploded in the evening sky. Buskirk says she watched as Emhoff instinctively stepped toward Harris to protect her.\n\nThat gesture touched Buskirk because her marriage had set off some fireworks of its own. She's a proud Black woman and Black Lives Matter activist who had violated an unwritten rule in the Black community - thou shalt not date or marry White men.\n\nThe Ohio woman had been told all her life she was supposed to marry a strong Black man and build a strong Black family. But then she met Tyler Buskirk, a self-assured White man who shared her love of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" and Dungeons & Dragons. Their marriage shocked some members of both of their families, and Buskirk says she's gotten plenty of icy, \"how-could-you?\" stares from Black women and men in public.\n\nSeeing Emhoff rush to protect Harris, though, reminded her not of what she's endured but what she's gained - a man who is ready to defend her, no matter what comes their way.\n\n\"He's my rock to come home to after fighting the world, my shield when it becomes too much, and my crusader when I can't get through,\" says Buskirk, 37. The pair live in Columbus, Ohio, where she works in a ministry at a local United Methodist Church.\n\n\"When I see Vice President Harris and her husband, I see us.\"\n\nWill more Black women begin to see the same potential for romantic love with White men? Harris' next four years in the White House could help provide an answer.\n\nHarris is the first female, Black and South Asian vice president of the United States, but she could also become another type of pioneer. She could inspire some Black women to reexamine a racial taboo that has shaped many of their private lives.\n\nHarris has so far shared few private details about her marriage to Emhoff, a lawyer . They were set up on a blind date in 2013, when Harris was California's attorney general, and married a year later.\n\nHarris did briefly respond to criticism of her marriage to a White man in a 2019 radio interview .\n\n\"Look, I love my husband, and he happened to be the one that I chose to marry, because I love him - and that was that moment in time, and that's it,\" Harris said. \"And he loves me.\"\n\nAs President Barack Obama's mere presence in the White House provoked discussions on biracial identity and Black marriage, Harris' marriage could lead more Black women to talk openly about this taboo, one scholar says.\n\n\"I think there is potential, but it depends on how public or private she is about her marriage,\" says Dianne M. Stewart, author of \"Black Women, Black Love: America's War on African American Marriage.\"\n\n\"If she decides to talk about this aspect of her life and enters conversations about it or allows the broader public to have information about her own journey, it could influence Black women's thinking,\" says Stewart, an associate professor of religion and African American studies at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nShe could even change long-held views in the Black community. One White House predecessor might even serve as a role model. Obama helped shift support for same-sex marriage among African Americans when he became the first President to say same-sex couples should be allowed to get married.\n\nMany Black women have traditionally shunned White men for a variety of reasons.  Some say they can't be with a White man because he wouldn't understand what it's like to experience racism. Others say they owe it to their race to marry Black men and build healthy Black families.\n\nYet other Black women cite more personal reasons for staying away from White men. They say being with a White man evokes memories of how White plantation owners and others sexually abused Black women during slavery and colonization. They're afraid of being treated as hypersexualized caricatures .  (Some Asian women are wary of being with White men for some of the same reasons as Black women.)\n\n\"I haven't completely reached the point where I can confidently order an Oreo ice cream swirl without some White guy telling me it 'looks like us,' but regardless of the number of 'I love the color of your skin' and 'cream to your coffee' messages that flood my DMs, determining whether a man is fetishizing me or not is not up to the discretion of White people,\" Kendall Tiarra wrote  in a recent essay titled, \" Am I a Fetish or Just the Prettiest Girl in the Room? \"\n\nTrump called him 'my African American.' His life hasn't been the same since How 'good White people' derail racial progress Am I racist? You may not like the answer I covered the Rodney King riots. This moment feels different. That's why I'm afraid Coronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions Black America is being hammered by a double pandemic Her father was called 'the most dangerous racist in America.' She wants a different legacy for her son\n\nTrump called him 'my African American.' His life hasn't been the same since How 'good White people' derail racial progress Am I racist?

She wants a different legacy for her son\n\nSome Black women reduce their reluctance to dating White men to one thought - it's too much work. For example, they don't want to expend energy teaching White men about racism or dealing with derogatory comments from friends, family and others.\n\nShamontiel L. Vaughn, a writer and editor, says she's open to dating White men, but 90% of the men she has dated are Black. She published an essay last year, \" Dating Black women: interracial dating gone right and wrong ,\" in which she explained why so many Black women shun dating White men.\n\nVaughn described what she and other Black women experienced on interracial dates:  non-Black men who fetishized their bodies, raised the topic of race when it wasn't necessary, or tried too hard \"to copy every single element of Black men\" because they \"watched too much BET.\"\n\nWhen Vaughn dates White men, she chooses those who have dated Black women before. She cites one White man she dated who \"was just cool.\"\n\n\"By the time he met me, he had dated a bunch of Black women. It wasn't new to him - like me putting a hair wrap on my head was no big deal,\" she says. \"He didn't ask what it was. He didn't ask why I oiled my hair. He had already been broken in.\"\n\nNikki Buskirk is familiar with many of these arguments. She once believed some of them. She says some in her family raised her with the expectation that she would marry a Black man because such unions helped build strong Black families and strengthened their race.\n\nSome of them objected to her dating Tyler and thought she was going through a phase. She experienced some nagging guilt at the time but overcame it.\n\nThey've now been married for 17 years and have three sons, ages 10, 7 and 3.\n\n\"He treats me like a queen,\" she says. \"I can't let guilt ruin the love we have and the love we built.\"\n\nReservations about dating or marrying across races may seem like a relic from the past. Interracial marriage has steadily become more common in the US since the Supreme Court ruled in the 1967 Loving v. Virginia decision that laws banning such unions were unconstitutional.\n\nIn 2015, one in 10 married people in the US had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, according to a Pew Research Center study . Popular culture is filled with images of couples such as Prince Harry and his bride Meghan Markle or tennis star Serena Williams with husband Alexis Ohanian.\n\nBut look closer at the lives of some Black women and the picture looks different. Many Black women seem trapped in a time warp where dating or marrying a White man is still rare. The same Pew report said Black men are twice as likely as Black women to have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity.  Some people try to nudge Black women into the interracial dating pool by citing a 2010 census statistic that found an estimated 71% of Black women between the ages of 25 to 29 had never been married.\n\nThis historical reluctance to be with White men has generated a stream of articles , books, and talk show segments . One law professor wrote a book arguing that more Black women should \"not marry down but out\" - in other words, consider marrying non-Black men instead of settling for Black men who don't meet their standards.\n\nYet there are some Black women who don't want to compromise. As Stewart notes in her book, they are inspired by examples such as Michelle Obama's marriage and they want what she seems to have - a Black man they can respect and love.\n\nThe wait for such a man, though, can be excruciating.\n\nStewart cites a single Black woman who confessed she was emotionally exhausted from living without Black male company.\n\n\"She just wanted Black male energy and presence in her life in some way,\" Stewart wrote. \"She told me that she could go an entire week, even several weeks, without having a substantive conversation with a Black man who was not her brother.\"\n\nIt's easy to cite Harris' marriage as an inspirational model for all people who say color doesn't matter. But color does matter to some.\n\nConsider colorism - the notion that a person's value and beauty is determined by the lightness of their skin.\n\nHarris is a fair-complexioned woman, Stewart notes. She cites a 2009 study that showed that young Black women who are fair complexioned were twice as likely to have married by age 29 than darker-skinned Black women. Colorism is a complex issue that spills into many areas of Black life, not just interracial marriage.\n\nStill, some darker-skinned Black women could look at Harris' marriage and take a different message about their own self-worth by concluding, \"that could never be me.\"\n\nStewart takes this issue head-on in her book. She writes that as more Black women pay attention to women like Harris, more \"will likely transgress cultural prohibitions\" and try to date a wider pool of racially and ethnically diverse men.\n\nHarris' marriage could unwittingly reinforce another racist assumption: White men are the best potential marriage partners, while Black men are among the worst.\n\n\"There is a conversation out there in social media now that goes something like this: Black women should just open themselves up to men outside their race,\" Stewart says. \"And the default men that a number of these social media influencers have in mind are White men.\"\n\nThe attention paid to Harris' marriage could also distract people from addressing another huge issue: the precarious state of Black marriage, Stewart says.\n\nStewart contends in her book that White supremacy has waged a systematic assault against Black marriage for 400 years. This attack has taken different forms: slavery, White standards of beauty, and mass incarceration, which removes Black men from the pool of potential partners.\n\nMany Black women are single today not because something is wrong with them, Stewart says. Instead, she says, their status is the result of a web of policies, customs and raw racism that make Black marriage \"difficult, delayed or impossible.\"\n\nStewart says she's not opposed to interracial unions. But she's concerned that encouraging Black women to marry non-Black men distracts people from addressing what many see as a crisis of Black marriage and romantic relationships.\n\n\"I don't want to solve this problem by ignoring it and asking Black women to marry outside their race,\" she says.\n\nNikki Buskirk has heard the arguments that White men can't understand what it's like for Black women to experience racism. She reframes the argument: Can any guy understand?\n\n\"I can say that about any guy,\" she says. \"A Black guy might not understand what it means to be a Black woman. Black women are the lowest of the lows when it comes to the hierarchy in America.\"\n\nBuskirk says she hopes Black women who are leery of dating White men pay attention to how Emhoff treats Harris.\n\n\"They could be missing out on something great if they let skin color stop them,\" she says.\n\nThis country's history, though, is filled with examples of how people have allowed skin color to blind them to other people's humanity.  And interracial relationships can provoke all sorts of strong and conflicting emotions. When some people see a Black and White couple, they don't see two individuals - they see a projection of their own racial myths, insecurities and fantasies.\n\nBuskirk's reaction to Emhoff's chivalrous Election Night gesture evoked the symbolic power of Barack Obama's presidency, when seemingly throwaway moments - the President breaking into \"Amazing Grace\" at a funeral, Michelle Obama dancing with schoolchildren - elicited deep affection in Black Americans.\n\nHarris could do the same. Her marriage to Emhoff could inspire Black women to think anew about their dating and marital choices.\n\nThat may depend, though, on whether Harris is willing to talk more about the delicate issues that swirl around her marriage.\n\nAnd whether a nation that is still so divided by race and skin color is ready to listen.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "'This was a hate crime': A year after a fire destroyed their house, an interracial family may soon be homeless again\n\nEditor's Note: In this series finale of \"This is Life with Lisa Ling,\" the show profiles interracial couples. The series airs this Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nA year after his Tennessee home was burned down and a racial slur was spray-painted on his property, Alan Mays says he's still pleading with authorities for answers to what he's calling a hate crime.\n\nAuthorities are actively investigating the cause of the fire that destroyed the family's seven-bedroom home in Ripley last November, but Mays says he's growing disillusioned as his family is now facing homelessness. \"We were never given any kind of closure,\" the Iraq War veteran told CNN.\n\nMays, who is Black, claims that authorities are treating the fire as an accident despite a documented pattern of harassment against his multiracial family. From repeated break-ins to security camera footage of people shouting racial slurs around their house, Mays says his family has been targeted for years.\n\nRelated article Racism is still a big problem in the US, but this trend offers some hope\n\nIf he were a White man, this would have been settled in 2015 when he says the harassment originally began, Mays said. \"They did not go after anybody. They didn't try. They didn't want me out there,\" Mays said.\n\nThe fire occurred early in the morning on November 1, 2021, while the Mays family was away on vacation. Firefighters arrived at their home because their fire alarm was going off and a neighbor had called in saying she could see flames from the house, according to the incident report from the Ripley Fire Department.\n\nThe report also states there was no nearby water source, so water had to be shuttled from other county departments, though Mays says there's a fire hydrant at the end of his street.\n\nThe house was a \"total loss,'\" the report states. It also notes \"graffiti\" had been painted on a wall above their pool.\n\nMays says that graffiti was a spray-painted racial slur: \"n***er lover.\" When the fire chief told him about the loss of his home and that slur, Mays said he could do nothing but cry.\n\nThe Ripley Police Department and Ripley Fire Department both did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nTennessee law prohibits an incident being called a hate crime until authorities have identified a suspect, which law enforcement has yet to do. As a result, the case is currently pending as a \"suspicious fire.\"\n\n\"We are limited in what we're able to release as our investigation into the incident remains active and ongoing,\" the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation told CNN in an emailed statement.\n\nThe last time Mays spoke to the bureau was in April, he said, and he's yet to receive any information.\n\n\"To this day, they've told us nothing about what happened in our house,\" Mays said. \"They've told us about no kind of suspect. They've told us nothing.\"\n\nWhen the bureau initially surveyed the scene last November, they didn't want to investigate the spray-painted slur, and instead wanted to focus solely on the origins of the fire, Mays said.\n\nBut that didn't make any sense to him, he said. To Mays, that slur is much more than graffiti - it's a message to leave and never return; it's a message of hate.\n\nInterracial marriage has seen a steady rise in the United States since 1967 when the Supreme Court overturned anti-miscegenation laws, and according to Gallup, most American adults now approve of marriage between Black and White people.\n\nRelated article They grew up surrounded by racism. But early on they chose a different path\n\nBut some studies suggest that rates of disapproval regarding interracial relationships are underestimated. It's no secret that interracial couples still face discrimination and hostility from others, sometimes even leading to violence.\n\nMays, whose Army service ended with an honorable discharge after a rocket blast injured him in 2009, told CNN navigating this past year has been the most difficult thing he's ever experienced.\n\nHis entire family has been left traumatized by the fire, Mays says. His children are confused and have recurring nightmares. His wife cries often and takes medication for chronic anxiety attacks, and they've both been receiving therapy through benefits provided by the Department of Veteran Affairs.\n\nSince the fire claimed their home, Mays said he and his family have been staying in an apartment complex south of Nashville. But he said they'll be homeless next week because their insurance company won't pay for their housing anymore.\n\n\"So, what am I gonna do? I'm a nervous wreck. I haven't slept in two nights, okay, because I don't know what to do,\" Mays told CNN. \"I'm lost ... I've done everything I could do. I did everything the right way.\"\n\nMays married his wife, who is White, in 2012 in Germany. They moved to Ripley, a small city nearly 60 miles from Memphis, in 2015.\n\nAffectionately known as \"the city of hospitality,\" Mays initially appreciated the God-fearing nature of this community.\n\n\"They have their Bibles; they go to church. It seemed like a place that you'd want to have your family,\" Mays said.\n\nThough Ripley's population is nearly 40% White and more than 54% Black, according to the US Census Bureau, Mays said he was the only Black man living in the predominantly White subdivision.\n\nRelated article When your own family is racist toward you\n\nAfter the fire, none of his neighbors offered his family any help - or even extended condolences, he told CNN.\n\nMays said this reaffirmed the pattern of strange events that his family had experienced since moving to the neighborhood. They've had to deal with strangers parking at the bottom of their driveway at night and taking pictures of them, poisoning their dogs, breaking into their garage, flying drones over their house and other disturbing instances, Mays claims.\n\nHis burglar alarm went off 37 times between 2020 and 2021, and he's kept all 20 of the police reports he'd filed concerning these puzzling incidents, he said.\n\n\"There were always things happening at my house,\" Mays said. \"And I told my wife after they tried to poison our dogs, 'Listen, that's how they do it in the South. They mess with your cars, your animals.'\"\n\n\"I said, 'something's 'finna happen here, and it's not good,'\" he added.\n\nTheir security cameras have captured multiple videos of people around their house and sometimes shouting racial slurs, according to Mays. They even caught images of a figure standing inside Mays' bedroom, he said. But authorities could never identify anyone, Mays said.\n\nMays had to buy six new security cameras in a year and a half because they were constantly being tampered with, he added. The night of the blaze, he had not yet replaced the last set of ruined cameras.\n\nRelated article Instruction about race may be under siege across the US, but this course is empowering students at a Southern high school\n\nKirsten Mays, Alan's wife, said she doesn't want to live in the United States anymore after what their family has gone through. Originally from Germany, she said she expected more from law enforcement in this country.\n\nWhen she and her husband went to the police station after one instance when someone broke into their home, she said that the extent of their help was to tell them to change their locks and get better cameras.\n\n\"It's no way possible that people are living like this and treating you like this, and no one does anything to defend you,\" she said.\n\nOn top of his community's apparent indifference and the authorities' perceived inaction, Mays told CNN that he's also been having trouble with his insurance company.\n\nHe filed a homeowner's insurance claim with Tennessee Farm Bureau Insurance immediately after his house burned down. He filed a complaint against them on September 21 for taking too long to give him a decision. They eventually sent him two similar denial letters on October 3 and October 13 - nearly a year after Mays filed the claim.\n\nThe October 3 denial concluded that the Mays family may have conspired to start the fire themselves and that Mays did not inform them of a pending lawsuit against him for an unpaid credit card. The October 13 denial similarly asserts that Mays did not notify the company of a felony charge for passing a bad check in 2001 - which a judge dismissed years ago, according to court records.\n\n\"We gave the insurance company every piece of information they asked for,\" Mays said. \"We did every interview.\"\n\nBut despite these letters, Mays received correspondence on November 4 that his claim had not been wholly denied, which just confuses him. He's exhausted with all the different answers.\n\nA spokesperson for the Tennessee Farm Bureau Insurance told CNN in an emailed statement, \"Please understand that Tennessee Farmers Insurance Company takes every fire claim very seriously, and review of those claims often involves extensive investigation. We of course cannot comment on specific investigations, claims, or litigation.\"\n\nAmid the difficulties last year, Mays' brother created a GoFundMe to assist in rebuilding their lives.\n\nWhether it's Mays' former neighbors, Ripley's fire and police departments, his insurance company, or even federal investigators, Mays feels there has been failure after failure in keeping his family safe and receiving justice.\n\nThe social systems meant to protect them have fallen through, Mays said.\n\n\"We believed in the system,\" Mays said. \"I fought for that system. And then when it came time for the system to reach out and help us, it has done nothing but let us down.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Louisiana justice who refused interracial marriage resigns\n\n(CNN) -- A Louisiana justice of the peace who drew criticism for refusing to marry an interracial couple has resigned, the secretary of state's office said Tuesday.\n\nKeith Bardwell resigned in person at the Louisiana secretary of state's office, said spokesman Jacques Berry. The state Supreme Court will appoint an interim justice of the peace to fill Bardwell's position, Berry said, and a special election will be held next year to fill the position permanently.\n\nBardwell, a justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused to perform a marriage ceremony for Beth Humphrey, 30, and her boyfriend Terence McKay, 32, both of Hammond, Louisiana, and sign their marriage license. The two were married by another justice of the peace.\n\nThe couple filed a federal discrimination lawsuit against Bardwell and his wife, Beth Bardwell, on October 20, claiming the two violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nBardwell, speaking to CNN affiliate WBRZ, said he was advised \"that I needed to step down because they was going to take me to court, and I was going to lose.\"\n\n\"I would probably do the same thing again,\" he said. \"I found out I can't be a justice of the peace and have a conscience.\"\n\nSen. Mary L. Landrieu, D-Louisiana, who had called for Bardwell's dismissal, said Tuesday night that \"Bardwell has finally consented to the will of the vast majority of Louisiana citizens and nearly every governmental official in Louisiana. Bardwell's refusal to issue marriage licenses to interracial couples was out of step with our Louisiana values and reflected terribly on our state. We are better off without him in public service.\"\n\nInitial reports were that Bardwell refused to issue a marriage license to the couple, but in the lawsuit Humphrey and McKay say they obtained the license from the parish court clerk's office and contacted Bardwell to see if he would perform the ceremony and sign the license to legally validate the marriage.\n\nHumphrey wound up speaking by telephone with Beth Bardwell, the lawsuit said, and Beth Bardwell asked Humphrey if they were a \"mixed couple.\" When told they were an interracial couple, Beth Bardwell said, according to the lawsuit, \"We don't do interracial weddings,\" and told her the two would have to go outside the parish to marry.\n\nBardwell did not return repeated phone calls from CNN in October, but told CNN affiliate WAFB that he had no regrets about the decision. \"It's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you haven't done wrong,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, he told the Hammond Daily Star in an October story that he did not marry the couple because he was concerned for the children that might be born of the relationship and that, in his experience, most interracial marriages don't last.\n\n\"I'm not a racist,\" he said. \"I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children.\"\n\nHumphrey said in October that she wanted Bardwell to resign. \"He doesn't believe he's being racist, but it is racist,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Bardwell estimated he refused to marry at least four other interracial couples in the past 21⁄2 years.\n\n\"Defendant Beth Bardwell ... aided, abetted and conspired with defendant Keith Bardwell to deprive plaintiffs of their constitutionally protected civil rights,\" according to the suit.\n\nNo response to the suit has been filed, and it was unclear whether the Bardwells had retained an attorney. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, claiming that Humphrey and McKay suffered emotional distress as a result of the incident.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said he believed Bardwell should lose his license, and the National Urban League called for an investigation into the incident by the U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, saying in a statement that Bardwell's actions were \"a huge step backward in social justice.\"\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, Tangipahoa Parish is about 70 percent white and 30 percent black.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court tossed out any racially-based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 ruling in the case Loving v. Virginia. In the unanimous decision, the court said that under the Constitution, \"the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.\"\n\nCNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report."

Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., the first openly gay lawmaker elected to the Senate.\n\nBaldwin revised the measure to win some Republican votes by adding language to make it clear that religious organizations wouldn't be required to perform same-sex marriages and that the federal government wouldn't be required to protect polygamous marriages.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said before the vote Tuesday that he was wearing the same tie he wore to the wedding of his daughter and her wife. \"It's personal to me,\" he told reporters.\n\nThe 12 Republican proponents were an eclectic group, including retiring Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Richard Burr of North Carolina; centrist deal-makers like Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina; a leadership member in Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa; and conservative Sens. Todd Young of Indiana, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming.\n\nLummis said backing the bill sparked blowback.\n\n\"My days since the first cloture vote on the Respect for Marriage Act as amended have involved a painful exercise in accepting admonishment and fairly brutal self-soul-searching - entirely avoidable, I might add, had I simply chosen to vote 'no,'\" she said. \"I, and many like me, have been vilified and despised by some who disagree with our beliefs. They do not withhold bitter invective. They use their own hateful speech to make sure that I, and others who believe as I do, that we are hated and despised by them.\"\n\nThe legislation came about after the conservative Supreme Court majority overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, sparking fears that the justices may also revisit liberal court precedents that enshrine marriage rights for gay and interracial couples.\n\nThe bill would require the federal government to recognize marriages that were valid in a state when they were performed. It would also ensure full benefits for marriages \"regardless of the couple's sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin,\" but it would not require states to issue marriage licenses contrary to state law.\n\nIf the bill becomes law and the Supreme Court rescinds the right to same-sex marriage, Americans could go to other states and get married if it's not legal in their states.\n\n\"This will ensure that wherever you live, if you get married in a state where it's legal, they have to recognize it wherever you are,\" a Democratic aide familiar with the legislation said. \"And you have the same rights, benefits, responsibilities and freedoms wherever you are.\"\n\nSchumer held a lengthy procedural vote open Monday as Democrats sought to cut a deal with GOP senators who threatened to drag out the process unless they got votes on amendments. The Senate had teed up three of them: one by Mike Lee, R-Utah, at a 60-vote threshold, and two by James Lankford, R-Okla., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., both of which needed just simple majorities to pass. After they failed, the bill passed.\n\nOne Democrat, Sen. Raphael Warnock, missed the vote as he campaigns in Georgia for next week's Senate runoff against Republican Herschel Walker.\n\nMost Republicans opposed the legislation, although earlier procedural votes all but made it clear that the bill had enough GOP support to pass. Proponents wanted to pass the measure in the lame-duck session before Republicans take control of the House on Jan. 3.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Virginia decision, polling suggests mixed-race couplings are on the rise , and the public at large is overwhelmingly comfortable with them.\n\nBut a number of recent headlines -- from the backlash to Cheerios and Old Navy ads featuring mixed-race couples to the online invective directed at \"Luke Cage\" star Mike Colter for having a white wife -- suggest that there is still far more work to do to normalize interracial romance in America.\n\nAmid these contentious cultural conversations comes the new film \"Loving,\" which opens in select cities on Friday. It dramatizes not just the the iconic Supreme Court case, but provides insight into the real life couple that inspired it, Mildred and Richard Loving.\n\nRelated: Cannes Embraces 'Loving', Film on Case That Ended Interracial Marriage Ban\n\nLike that now-deceased duo, the film itself is soft spoken and tentative, but with an unmistakable undercurrent of gravitas. It already has considerable Oscar buzz, especially for its two leads, Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga , and it's sure to be a talker because of the story's parallels to the modern marriage equality fight. But according to its director Jeff Nichols , this movie has a higher purpose in mind.\n\n\"I want people to walk out of the theater not necessarily thinking about the politics, but the human beings at the center of those politics,\" Nichols told NBC News. \"I think there are a lot of people we run into that have no concept of Richard and Mildred, or that anti-miscegenation laws existed at all.\"\n\nNichols counts himself among those who were ignorant of the Lovings' story until fairly recently. He first learned of the couple's crusade to have their union respected four years ago. He saw the celebrated HBO documentary \"The Loving Story,\" directed by Nancy Buirski, and was struck by the Lovings' quiet dignity.\n\nNichols' adaptation, similarly, is anything but histrionic. Although it does depict the brutality of how the Lovings were treated - at one point being ripped out of their bed and jailed separately simply because they were a married mixed-race couple, or in another moment having their own children being used to make the case against their marriage - Nichols didn't want audiences to feel sorry for the protagonists. He wanted viewers to empathize with them.\n\nAt early screenings around the country, including one of the first at the new African-American History Museum in Washington, D.C., it appears that the film is having the desired effect.\n\n\"I can't tell you how many people have walked up to me saying, 'This is my story,'\" said Nichols.\n\nRelated: Old Navy Interracial Ad Resurrects Heated Debate\n\nMore conversation may be just what the doctor ordered when it comes to curing what remnants remain of opposition to mixed race marriage.\n\nIn August, a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , which surveyed students at the University of Nebraska, determined that when viewing engagement photos of mixed-race couples, participants registered cerebral \"disgust\" even if they didn't verbally express it and were more apt to recognize same-race couples as human beings.\n\nThe primary author of the study, Allison Skinner, who is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Washington and in an interracial relationship herself, concedes that while the sample size is small and may not be indicative of the nation at large, the results should raise questions about how settled opinions are about the topic.\n\n\"I think there has been a big change in society about whether it's OK to explicitly acknowledge race,\" she told NBC News. \"It's hard to address problems that we don't acknowledge are there.\"\n\nWith Black Lives Matter protests, coupled with shootings by and of white police officers, and recent surveys suggesting there is anxiety over a perceived spike in racial tensions in America -- it may be a dialogue that's becoming increasingly unavoidable.\n\n\"The reason this film is important for right now is that equality is something every generation has to define for itself,\" Nichols said. \"Although Richard and Mildred don't provide all the answers, they show us how to talk about it. They do that by showing us the humanity at the center of these things.\"\n\nNichols' hope is that audiences leave \"Loving\" thinking about that couple -- their courage and decency -- which continues to inspire him four years after taking this project on.\n\n\"I think I am still kind of reeling from the experience, to be honest,\" he said.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Virginia made it possible for couples of different races and ethnicities to marry, such unions have increased fivefold among newlyweds, according to a new report .\n\nIn 2015, 17 percent, or one in six newlyweds, had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity compared with only 3 percent in 1967, according to a Pew Research Center report released Thursday.\n\n\"More broadly, one-in-10 married people in 2015 - not just those who recently married - had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity. This translates into 11 million people who were intermarried,\" the report states.\n\nThis June 12 marks the 50th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia , the landmark Supreme Court decision which overturned bans on interracial marriage. The story of the case's plaintiffs, Richard and Mildred Loving, was recently told in the 2016 movie \"Loving.\"\n\nLatinos and Asians are the most likely groups to intermarry in the U.S., with 39 percent of U.S.-born Hispanic newlyweds and 46 percent of Asian newlyweds marrying a spouse of a different race or ethnicity. The rates were lower with foreign-born newlyweds included: 29 percent for Asians and 27 percent for Hispanics.\n\nThe largest share of intermarried couples - 42 percent - include one Latino and one white spouse, though that number has declined from 1980, when 56 percent of all intermarried couples included one white and one Hispanic person.\n\nThe most significant increase in intermarriage is among black newlyweds; the share of blacks marrying outside their race or ethnicity has tripled from 5 percent to 18 percent since 1980.\n\nThere are gender differences though, when it comes to intermarriage among certain groups. Male black newlyweds are twice as likely to marry outside their race or ethnicity than black women (24 percent to 12 percent). Among Asian Americans, it's the opposite: more than a third (36 percent) of newly married Asian women had spouses of a different race or ethnicity compared to 21 percent of newly married Asian men. Education also played a role. There has been a dramatic decline in intermarriage among Asian newlyweds 25 and older who have a high school education or less, from 36 percent to 26 percent during the years from 1980 to 2015.\n\nWhile white newlyweds have seen a surge of intermarriage, with rates rising from 4 to 11 percent, they are the least likely of all major racial or ethnic groups to intermarry.\n\nPeople who are married to a person of a different race tend to live in metropolitan areas. Honolulu has the highest share of intermarried couples at 42 percent.\n\nDanielle Karczewski, a black Puerto Rican woman, met her Polish-born husband, Adam, when they were interns at a law firm. They've now been together for 12 years, and married for six.\n\n\"I don't know if we're just extremely blessed, but we've gotten nothing but tons of support from friends and family,\" Danielle Karczewski, 34, of Rockaway, New Jersey, told NBC News.\n\n\"We're a very multicultural family,\" she said, adding that her mother-in-law is married to an Indian man and their Polish friend has a black Cuban husband. \"We have a Polish version of Noche Buena (Christmas Eve) where my mother-law will cook Indian food - we've managed to maintain our individual cultures while celebrating each other's.\"\n\nGrowing up with a black father and white mother did not seem unusual to Emily Moss, 24. In fact, her parents' 12-year age gap was more often a topic of conversation. She bonded with her boyfriend, Ross Bauer, who is of Polish and German descent, over the fact that the two of them had older fathers. But Moss, who lives in New Haven, Connecticut, said being biracial has shaped her politics, particularly on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\n\"Allowing people to marry whomever they love seemed so obvious to me, and I think some of that comes from knowing that my parents' marriage was illegal once too and how that wasn't based in anything but fear and prejudice,\" Moss said.\n\nBut other couples say their union was startling to those in their circles, at least when they first got together.\n\nToni Callas met her future husband Peter in the early 1990s when they were both working at The Times of Trenton, in Central New Jersey. It took three years for them to go on a date. When they met each others' families, their parents were surprised by their relationship; Toni is African American and Peter was third-generation Greek American; he died in 2014.\n\n\"Neither of us ever brought home anyone outside our race,\" Callas said. While their families eventually embraced the couple, who married in 2001, it was sometimes a challenge to be seen together when they were out in public.\n\n\"People wouldn't say anything to us, but I'd sometimes notice people staring at us. As time went on, I stopped letting it bother me - it wasn't my job to manage their 'isms,' whether that's racism or whatever,\" Callas said.\n\nAccording to the Pew study, a growing share of Americans say that marriages of people of different races is a good thing and those who would oppose the unions is dropping.\n\nBrigham Young University sociology professor Ryan Gabriel has studied mixed-race couples; he himself is of mixed race. Gabriel said it's difficult to predict how these couples and their multiracial children may shape the socio-cultural and political landscape in the future. But he said people who are married to someone of a different race tend to be more progressive in their politics and more empathetic overall.\n\nFor example, if a person who is white is married to a person who is of Asian, African-American or Hispanic descent, and their children are mixed, the white person may be inclined to fight for racial justice because their family is now mixed, Gabriel said.\n\n\"You might spend the holidays together with nonwhite individuals who are now a part of your family. It gives someone the opportunity to see a person of a different race as a complete human being outside of stereotypes they may have had in the past,\" Gabriel said. \"It helps people realize that race is more a social construct than an actual reality.\"\n\nFor Denver-based Austin Klemmer, 27, and his Vietnamese-born wife, Huyen Nguyen, 30, it's culture, not race, that has played a major part in their relationship since they met in Hanoi more than four years ago.\n\n\"We do our best to stay attuned to each other's cultural standards,\" said Klemmer. \"For example, I always make sure to serve her grandmother first, since you have to respect the level of hierarchy.\"\n\nForty-year-old John B. Georges met his future wife Mythily Kamath Georges, 39, online in 2014. They married in 2015 and had a son in 2016. Georges was born and raised in Brooklyn and his family is Haitian.

      "text": "After 40 years, interracial marriage flourishing\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nThe charisma king of the 2008 presidential field. The world's best golfer. The captain of the New York Yankees. Besides superstardom, Barack Obama, Tiger Woods and Derek Jeter have another common bond: Each is the child of an interracial marriage.\n\nFor most of U.S. history, in most communities, such unions were taboo.\n\nIt was only 40 years ago - on June 12, 1967 - that the U.S. Supreme Court knocked down a Virginia statute barring whites from marrying nonwhites. The decision also overturned similar bans in 15 other states.\n\nSince that landmark Loving v. Virginia ruling, the number of interracial marriages has soared; for example, black-white marriages increased from 65,000 in 1970 to 422,000 in 2005, according to Census Bureau figures.\n\nStanford: 7 percent of couples interracial Factoring in all racial combinations, Stanford University sociologist Michael Rosenfeld calculates that more than 7 percent of America's 59 million married couples in 2005 were interracial, compared to less than 2 percent in 1970.\n\nCoupled with a steady flow of immigrants from all parts of the world, the surge of interracial marriages and multiracial children is producing a 21st century America more diverse than ever, with the potential to become less stratified by race.\n\n\"The racial divide in the U.S. is a fundamental divide. ... but when you have the 'other' in your own family, it's hard to think of them as 'other' anymore,\" Rosenfeld said. \"We see a blurring of the old lines, and that has to be a good thing, because the lines were artificial in the first place.\"\n\nFrom exotic to commonplace The boundaries were still distinct in 1967, a year when the Sidney Poitier film \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" - a comedy built around parents' acceptance of an interracial couple - was considered groundbreaking. The Supreme Court ruled that Virginia could not criminalize the marriage that Richard Loving, a white, and his black wife, Mildred, entered into nine years earlier in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut what once seemed so radical to many Americans is now commonplace.\n\nMany prominent blacks - including Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, civil rights leader Julian Bond and former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun - have married whites. Well-known whites who have married blacks include former Defense Secretary William Cohen and actor Robert DeNiro.\n\nLast year, the Salvation Army installed Israel Gaither as the first black leader of its U.S. operations. He and his wife, Eva, who is white, wed in 1967 - the first interracial marriage between Salvation Army officers in the United States.\n\nOpinion polls show overwhelming popular support, especially among younger people, for interracial marriage.\n\nThat's not to say acceptance has been universal. Interviews with interracial couples from around the country reveal varied challenges, and opposition has lingered in some quarters.\n\nBob Jones University in South Carolina only dropped its ban on interracial dating in 2000; a year later 40 percent of the voters objected when Alabama became the last state to remove a no-longer-enforceable ban on interracial marriages from its constitution.\n\nTaunts and threats, including cross burnings, still occur sporadically. In Cleveland, two white men were sentenced to prison earlier this year for harassment of an interracial couple that included spreading liquid mercury around their house.\n\nTough times for some multiracial families More often, though, the difficulties are more nuanced, such as those faced by Kim and Al Stamps during 13 years as an interracial couple in Jackson, Miss.\n\nKim, a white woman raised on Cape Cod, met Al, who is black, in 1993 after she came to Jackson's Tougaloo College to study history. Together, they run Cool Al's - a popular hamburger restaurant - while raising a 12-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter in the state with the nation's lowest percentage (0.7) of multiracial residents.\n\nThe children are homeschooled, Kim said, because Jackson's schools are largely divided along racial lines and might not be comfortable for biracial children. She said their family triggered a wave of \"white flight\" when they moved into a mostly white neighborhood four years ago - \"People were saying to my kids, 'What are you doing here?\"'\n\n\"Making friends here has been really, really tough,\" Kim said. \"I'll go five years at a time with no white friends at all.\"\n\nYet some of the worst friction has been with her black in-laws. Kim said they accused her of scheming to take over the family business, and there's been virtually no contact for more than a year.\n\n\"Everything was race,\" Kim said. \"I was called 'the white devil.\"'\n\nHer own parents in Massachusetts have been supportive, Kim said, but she credited her mother with foresight.\n\n\"She told me, 'Your life is going to be harder because of this road you've chosen - it's going to be harder for your kids,\"' Kim said. \"She was absolutely right.\"\n\nAl Stamps said he is less sensitive to disapproval than his wife, and tries to be philosophical.\n\n\"I'm always cordial,\" he said. \"I'll wait to see how people react to us. If I'm not wanted, I'll move on.\"\n\n'In-your-face racism is pretty rare' It's been easier, if not always smooth, for other couples.\n\nMajor Cox, a black Alabamian, and his white wife, Cincinnati-born Margaret Meier, have lived on the Cox family homestead in Smut Eye, Ala., for more than 20 years, building a large circle of black and white friends while encountering relatively few hassles.\n\n\"I don't feel it, I don't see it,\" said Cox, 66, when asked about racist hostility. \"I live a wonderful life as a nonracial person.\"\n\nMeier says she occasionally detects some expressions of disapproval of their marriage, \"but flagrant, in-your-face racism is pretty rare now.\"\n\nCox - an Army veteran and former private detective who now joins his wife in raising quarter horses - longs for a day when racial lines in America break down.\n\n\"We are sitting on a powder keg of racism that's institutionalized in our attitudes, our churches and our culture,\" he said, \"that's going to destroy us if we don't undo it.\"\n\nSometimes, a blend of nationalities In many cases, interracial families embody a mix of nationalities as well as races. Michelle Cadeau, born in Sweden, and her husband, James, born in Haiti, are raising their two sons as Americans in racially diverse West Orange, N.J., while teaching them about all three cultures.\n\n\"I think the children of families like ours will be able to make a difference in the world, and do things we weren't able to do,\" Michelle Cadeau said. \"It's really important to put all their cultures together, to be aware of their roots, so they grow up not just as Swedish or Haitian or American, but as global citizens.\"\n\nMeanwhile, though, there are frustrations - such as school forms for 5-year-old Justin that provide no option for him to be identified as multiracial.\n\n\"I'm aware there are going to be challenges,\" Michelle said. \"There's stuff that's been working for a very long time in this country that is not going to work anymore.\"\n\nTicking more than one racial category The boom in interracial marriages forced the federal government to change its procedures for the 2000 census, allowing Americans for the first time to identify themselves by more than one racial category.\n\nAbout 6.8 million described themselves as multiracial - 2.4 percent of the population - adding statistical fuel to the ongoing debate over what race really means.\n\nKerry Ann Rockquemore, professor of African-American studies at the University of Illinois-Chicago, is the daughter of a black father and white mother, and says she is asked almost daily how she identifies herself.\n\nThe surge in interracial marriage comes at \"a very awkward moment\" in America's long struggle with racism, she says.\n\n\"We all want deeply and sincerely to be beyond race, to live in a world where race doesn't matter, but we continue to see deep racial disparities,\" Rockquemore said. \"For interracial families, the great challenge is when the kids are going to leave home and face a world that is still very racialized.\"\n\nLove can take its toll The stresses on interracial couples can take a toll. The National Center for Health Statistics says their chances of a breakup within 10 years are 41 percent, compared to 31 percent for a couple of the same race.\n\nIn some categories of interracial marriage, there are distinct gender-related trends. More than twice as many black men marry white women as vice versa, and about three-fourths of white-Asian marriages involve white men and Asian women.\n\nC.N. Le, a Vietnamese-American who teaches sociology at the University of Massachusetts, says the pattern has created some friction in Asian-American communities.\n\n\"Some of the men view the women marrying whites as sellouts, and a lot of Asian women say, 'Well, we would want to date you more, but a lot of you are sexist or patriarchal,\"' said Le, who attributes the friction in part to gender stereotypes of Asians that have been perpetuated by American films and TV shows.\n\n'Encouraging development' Kelley Kenney, a professor at Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, is among those who have bucked the black-white gender trend. A black woman, she has been married since 1988 to a fellow academic of Irish-Italian descent, and they have jointly offered programs for the American Counseling Association about interracial couples.\n\nKenney recalled some tense moments in 1993 when, soon after they moved to Kutztown, a harasser shattered their car window and placed chocolate milk cartons on their lawn. \"It was very powerful to see how the community rallied around us,\" she said.\n\nKenney is well aware that some blacks view interracial marriage as a potential threat to black identity, and she knows her two daughters, now 15 and 11, will face questions on how they identify themselves.\n\n\"For older folks in the black community,\" she said \"it's a feeling of not wanting people to forget where they came from.\"\n\nYet some black intellectuals embrace the surge in interracial marriages and multiracial families; among them is Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy, who addressed the topic in his latest book, \"Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity, and Adoption.\"\n\n\"Malignant racial biases can and do reside in interracial liaisons,\" Kennedy wrote. \"But against the tragic backdrop of American history, the flowering of multiracial intimacy is a profoundly moving and encouraging development.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Interracial marriage in US hits new high: 1 in 12\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nInterracial marriages in the U.S. have climbed to 4.8 million - a record 1 in 12 - as a steady flow of new Asian and Hispanic immigrants expands the pool of prospective spouses. Blacks are now substantially more likely than before to marry whites.\n\nA Pew Research Center study , released Thursday, details a diversifying America where interracial unions and the mixed-race children they produce are challenging typical notions of race.\n\n\"The rise in interracial marriage indicates that race relations have improved over the past quarter century,\" said Daniel Lichter, a sociology professor at Cornell University. \"Mixed-race children have blurred America's color line. They often interact with others on either side of the racial divide and frequently serve as brokers between friends and family members of different racial backgrounds,\" he said. \"But America still has a long way to go.\"\n\nThe figures come from previous censuses as well as the 2008-2010 American Community Survey, which surveys 3 million households annually. The figures for \"white\" refer to those whites who are not of Hispanic ethnicity. For purposes of defining interracial marriages, Hispanic is counted as a race by many in the demographic field.\n\nThe study finds that 8.4 percent of all current U.S. marriages are interracial, up from 3.2 percent in 1980. While Hispanics and Asians remained the most likely, as in previous decades, to marry someone of a different race, the biggest jump in share since 2008 occurred among blacks, who historically have been the most segregated.\n\nStates in the West where Asian and Hispanic immigrants are more numerous, including Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico and California, were among the most likely to have couples who \"marry out\" - more than 1 in 5. The West was followed by the South, Northeast and Midwest. By state, mostly white Vermont had the lowest rate of intermarriage, at 4 percent.\n\nIn all, more than 15 percent of new marriages in 2010 were interracial.\n\nThe numbers also coincide with Pew survey data showing greater public acceptance of mixed marriage, coming nearly half a century after the Supreme Court in 1967 barred race-based restrictions on marriage. (In 2000, Alabama became the last state to lift its unenforceable ban on interracial marriages.) About 83 percent of Americans say it is \"all right for blacks and whites to date each other,\" up from 48 percent in 1987. As a whole, about 63 percent of those surveyed say it \"would be fine\" if a family member were to marry outside their own race.\n\nMinorities, young adults, the higher educated and those living in Western or Northeast states were more likely to say mixed marriages are a change for the better for society. The figure was 61 percent for 18- to 29-year-olds, for instance, compared to 28 percent for those 65 and older.\n\n'Race isn't real' Due to increasing interracial marriages, multiracial Americans are a small but fast-growing demographic group, making up about 9 million, or 8 percent of the minority population. Together with blacks, Hispanics and Asians, the Census Bureau estimates they collectively will represent a majority of the U.S. population by mid-century.\n\n\"Race is a social construct; race isn't real,\" said Jonathan Brent, 28. The son of a white father and Japanese-American mother, Brent helped organize multiracial groups in southern California and believes his background helps him understand situations from different perspectives.\n\nBrent, now a lawyer in Charlottesville, Va., says at varying points in his life he has identified with being white, Japanese and more recently as someone of mixed ethnic background. He doesn't feel constrained with whom he socially interacts or dates.\n\n\"Race is becoming a personal thing. It is what I feel like I am,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Pew report, more than 25 percent of Hispanics and Asians who married in 2010 had a spouse of a different race. That's compared to 17.1 percent of blacks and 9.4 percent of whites. Of the 275,500 new interracial marriages in 2010, 43 percent were white-Hispanic couples, 14.4 percent were white-Asian, 11.9 percent were white-black, and the remainder were other combinations.\n\nStill, the share of Asians who intermarried has actually declined recently - from 30.5 percent in 2008 to 27.7 percent in 2010. In contrast, blacks who married outside their race increased in share from 15.5 percent to 17.1 percent, due in part to a rising black middle class that has more interaction with other races.\n\nIntermarriage among whites rose in share slightly, while among Hispanics the rate was flat, at roughly 25.7 percent.\n\n\"In the past century, intermarriage has evolved from being illegal, to be a taboo and then to be merely unusual. And with each passing year, it becomes less unusual,\" said Paul Taylor, director of Pew's Social & Demographic Trends project. \"That says a lot about the state of race relations. Behaviors have changed and attitudes have changed.\"\n\nHe noted that interracial marriages among Hispanics and Asians may be slowing somewhat as recent immigration and their rapid population growth provide minorities more ethnically similar partners to choose from. But Taylor believes the longer-term trend of intermarriage is likely to continue.\n\n\"For younger Americans, racial and ethnic diversity are a part of their lives,\" he said.\n\nDivorce trends The Pew study also tracks some divorce trends, citing studies using government data that found overall divorce rates higher for interracial couples. One study conducted a decade ago determined that mixed-race couples had a 41 percent chance of separation or divorce, compared to a 31 percent chance for those who married within their race.\n\nAnother analysis found divorce rates among mixed-race couples to be more dependent on the specific race combination, with white women who married outside their race more likely to divorce. Mixed marriages involving blacks and whites also were considered least stable, followed by Hispanic-white couples.\n\nOther findings:\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Report finds growing acceptance of interracial marriage in US\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nAs the number of interracial marriages in the U.S. continues to rise, so does Americans' acceptance of them, a new Pew Research Center report finds.\n\nThe report, \" The Rise of Intermarriage ,\" analyzed characteristics of people who marry spouses of a different race or ethnicity. It was based on Census data and on findings from nationwide telephone surveys conducted by Pew.\n\nIt found that about 15 percent of all new marriages in the United States in 2010 were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity, more than double the share in 1980. The share of intermarriages among all married couples, regardless of when they married, hit an all-time high of 8.4 percent. That's up from 3.2 percent in 1980.\n\nAmong newlyweds in 2010, Asians, at 28 percent, and Hispanics, at 26 percent, were most likely to \"marry out,\" followed by blacks, at 17 percent. Whites, at 9 percent, were least likely to marry someone of a different race or ethnicity. (The report noted whites are by far the largest racial group in the U.S., so even though their intermarriage rate is relatively low, marriages between whites and minority groups are the most common.)\n\nThe data also suggest Americas are much more tolerant and accepting of interracial marriage.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans, 63 percent, say it \"would be fine\" if a member of their own family were to marry someone outside their racial or ethnic group. In 1986, the public was divided about this, with 28 percent of Americans saying people of different races marrying each other was not acceptable for anyone and 33 percent viewing intermarriage as acceptable for everyone.\n\nMore than four in 10 Americans, 43 percent, say that more people of different races marrying each other has been a change for the better in our society, while 11 percent say it has been a change for the worse and 44 percent say it has made no difference.\n\nMsnbc.com asked its Facebook followers about their experience with interracial marriage, and several agreed America is becoming more tolerant.\n\n\"People are much more accepting now than ever,\" wrote Leonard Paul Hotkowski. \"I'm white male, her black female. Tends to be that we get a bit of attitude from other black women. Not all black women though, just a specific type of black women. Some older white people in my family also aren't as accepting but overall society I feel looks at us in a good light.\"\n\nRead more from our Facebook readers on their interracial marriage experiences\n\n\"I think that no matter what there will always be people who don't understand that we didn't set out looking for one particular ethnic group,\" wrote Eva Colin, who is white and whose husband is Hispanic. \"We just fell in love. The thought we might upset anyone because of who we are just didn't matter.\"\n\nPatrice Stallings Sharon said she is a black woman married to a white/Hispanic man.\n\n\"I also feel that it is accepted much more these days than ever before, but I also believe depending where you live,\" she wrote. \"We currently live in a military town filled with interracial couples and children. We are in the process of moving to Fort Worth, TX in a few weeks... and the looks we get are UNREAL! I personally get very upset at the stares and angry looks my family receives. But my husband is very tolerant of it. People stare at my daughter all the time and even ask me if she belongs to me, and proceeds to tell me that she just looks Hispanic. I feel like I need to carry her birth certificate around at times.\"\n\nThe Pew report noted that for most of the nation's history, a majority of states had laws that made it illegal for whites and nonwhites to marry. Interracial marriage in the U.S. wasn't fully legal in all states until a 1967 Supreme Court ruling deemed anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional.\n\nRead the full Pew report on interracial marriage\n\nMore content from msnbc.com and NBC News\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Thomas wants the Supreme Court to overturn landmark rulings that legalized contraception, same-sex marriage\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nThe Supreme Court must revisit and overrule past landmark decisions that legalized the right to obtain contraception, the right to same-sex intimacy and the right to same-sex marriage, conservative Justice Clarence Thomas wrote Friday .\n\nThomas, in a concurring opinion to the court's precedent-breaking decision overturning Roe v. Wade and wiping out constitutional protections for abortion rights, said that he would do away with the doctrine of \"substantive due process\" and explicitly called on the court to overrule the watershed civil rights rulings in Griswold v. Connecticut, Lawrence v. Texas and Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\nGriswold was a 1965 Supreme Court decision that established the right for married couples to buy and use contraceptives. It became the basis for the right to contraception for all couples a few years later. Lawrence was a 2003 Supreme Court decision that established the right for consenting adults to engage in same-sex intimacy. Obergefell was a 2015 Supreme Court decision to establish the right for same-sex couples to be married.\n\nThe legal reasoning in all three monumental decisions - as well in the two decisions, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, that had prior to Friday established a legal right to abortion care - relied heavily on the doctrine of substantive due process.\n\n\"As I have previously explained, 'substantive due process' is an oxymoron that 'lack[s] any basis in the Constitution,'\" he wrote. He later called it a \"legal fiction\" that is \"particularly dangerous.\"\n\nSubstantive due process is a term in constitutional law that essentially allows courts to protect certain rights, even if those rights are not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. It has been interpreted in many cases to apply to matters relating to the right to privacy - including over matters like love, intimacy and sex - which is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.\n\nConservative jurists have long dismissed the legal reasoning that supported that interpretation of substantive due process. And Thomas, a member of the bench's conservative wing, made that clear in his writings in Friday's decision.\n\n\"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Because any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous,' we have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nAnd because the court, in its ruling Friday, drew heavily on that very idea - that substantive due process is not in the Constitution - Thomas concluded that almost all other precedents that relied on the doctrine should also be overturned.\n\n\"I join the opinion of the Court because it correctly holds that there is no constitutional right to abortion. Respondents invoke one source for that right: the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee that no State shall 'deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.' The Court well explains why, under our substantive due process precedents, the purported right to abortion is not a form of 'liberty' protected by the Due Process Clause. Such a right is neither 'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition' nor 'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,'\" he wrote.\n\nThomas then went even further, writing that the court, after overruling those particular decisions, should eliminate \"substantive due process\" altogether.\n\n\"In future cases, we should 'follow the text of the Constitution, which sets forth certain substantive rights that cannot be taken away, and adds, beyond that, a right to due process when life, liberty, or property is to be taken away,'\" he wrote. \"Substantive due process conflicts with that textual command and has harmed our country in many ways.\"\n\n\"Accordingly,\" he added, \"we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\nThomas, who joined the court in 1991 as only the second Black justice in Supreme Court history, dissented in both the Lawrence and Obergefell decisions.\n\nIn Friday's opinion, Thomas made no mention of Loving v. Virginia , the landmark 1967 ruling by the Supreme Court that struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriage. That decision relied in part on the substantive due process doctrine - and was cited in several subsequent decisions that did as well, including Obergefell in 2015.\n\nBut Thomas, whose wife is white - meaning their interracial marriage could have been deemed in illegal in certain states had the court not ruled the way it did in Loving - did not mention the 1967 decision as one that should be revisited. In their own opinions, Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh both referred to Loving, writing that it should not be revisited despite its reliance on substantive due process.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, speaking to the nation following the ruling Friday afternoon, specifically addressed Thomas' analysis, saying it paves an \"extreme and dangerous path\" that the \"court is now taking us on.\"\n\n\"I've warned about how this decision risks a broader right to privacy for everyone,\" Biden said. \"That's because Roe recognized the fundamental right to privacy and has served as a basis for so many more rights that... we've come to take for granted, that are ingrained in the fabric of this country: the right to make the best decisions for your health, the right to use birth control, a married couple in the privacy of their bedroom for God's sake, the right to marry the person you love.\"\n\n\"Justice Thomas said as much today. He explicitly called to reconsider the right of marriage equality, the right of couples to make their choices on contraception,\" Biden added.\n\nThomas' opinion also attracted the ire of prominent civil rights groups, as well as Jim Obergefell, the plaintiff in the 2015 decision that Thomas wants the court to overturn.\n\n\"The millions of loving couples who have the right to marriage equality to form their own families do not need Clarence Thomas imposing his individual twisted morality upon them,\" Obergefell told NBC News in a statement. \"If you want to see an error in judgment, Clarence Thomas, look in the mirror.\"\n\nSarah Kate Ellis, head of the LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD, called Thomas' opinion \"a blaring red alert for the LGBTQ community and for all Americans.\"\n\n\"We will never go back to the dark days of being shut out of hospital rooms, left off of death certificates, refused spousal benefits, or any of the other humiliations that took place in the years before Obergefell,\" Ellis said in a statement. \"And we definitely will not go back to the pre-Lawrence days of being criminalized just because we are LGBTQ.\"\n\n\"But that's exactly what Thomas is threatening to do to the country,\" Ellis added.\n\nAdam Edelman is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Virginia,' Have Views on Interracial Marriage Evolved?\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nLike many other milestones in civil rights legislation, the acceptance of interracial marriage has hardly been a smooth, celebrated or overnight process.\n\nSeemingly unfathomable, just 50 years ago it was illegal for blacks and whites to marry in 16 states because of \"anti-miscegenation\" laws. But the Supreme Court redirected history when it struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriage, on June 12, 1967, in Loving v. Virginia.\n\nMildred and Richard Loving, however, were not the only courageous interracial couple to make headlines that year.\n\nJust a few months after the Loving decision, Time magazine featured on its cover, the California wedding of Peggy Rusk , the daughter of then Secretary of State Dean Rusk, to Guy Smith, an African-American man.\n\nAny high-profile wedding comes with a fair amount of attention, but the stares the Smiths endured after their widely publicized nuptials were indicative of a larger issue beyond harmless curiosity.\n\n\"One of my biggest goals throughout our marriage was to do what I could to help prevent lose-lose situations for Guy,\" Smith said in an email to NBCBLK. She made the conscious decision to not look people in the eye when they stared at her or her husband to avoid, \"confrontations where his choice was to be humiliated and back away or stand his ground and risk a fight.\"\n\nFortunately, views on interracial marriage have evolved since Smith's marriage in 1967 when, according to the Pew Research Center, only 3 percent of newlyweds were interracial. As of 2015, 17 percent of newly married couples in the U.S. have a spouse of another race.\n\nBut it's the details behind the data that crystallize where America really stands on the issue.\n\nFifty years ago today, the Supreme Court legalized interracial marriage nationwide. Mildred & Richard Loving got married in DC. #LovingDay pic.twitter.com/WtRNyLVS1m\n\n\"The big reason behind the rise of 17 percent has to do with an increase in Hispanic and Asian interracial marriage,\" said Kimberly DaCosta, a sociologist and professor at New York University. \"Blacks and whites marry least among those who intermarry. And we have to ask ourselves why that is and what does it mean.\"\n\nIt's certainly a fact that since slavery, negative views of blacks have been passed down through generations and continue to permeate segments of society.\n\nRelated: One in Six Newly Married Americans Has Spouse of Different Race or Ethnicity\n\n\"There are still stereotypical ideas in existence,\" said Jelani Cobb, a professor at Columbia Journalism School who writes about race, history and politics. \"Attitudes have become more liberal about interracial marriage, but not universally and not to equal degrees. There's a scale of acceptability-Asians marrying whites, Hispanics marrying whites, lastly, blacks marrying whites.\"\n\nThe deep-seated beliefs that people have on race and pop culture, particularly television programming, are other contemporary indicators of how society feels about interracial couples.\n\nAfter Loving, there have been efforts to mainstream black-white romantic relationships. Anyone of a certain age remembers the romantic comedy \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?\" where Sidney Poitier plays the black fiancé meeting his future white in-laws.\n\nBut what's widely recognized as the first interracial kiss on television, airing in 1968 on \"Star Trek\", between Captain Kirk and Uhura, played by William Shatner and Nichelle Nichols, really tested society's tolerance levels.\n\n\"We've come a long way since the time of the Kirk kiss,\" said David Bushman, a television curator at The Paley Center For Media. \"They originally thought Spock should kiss her since he wasn't 100 percent human. Networks, then, were afraid of reactions from stations in the south and losing sponsors.\"\n\n\"There will always be a percentage of people who feel the necessity to hate difference no matter where they are from. Small mindedness and fear seem to go together\"- Peggy Smith\n\nTelevision, nevertheless, through the years has helped normalize interracial couples, according to Bushman. Shows like \"The Jeffersons,\" and modern ones like \"Scandal\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\" where romantic relationships between people of different races are ubiquitous, reflect America's changing demographics and tolerance levels.\n\nBut resistance lingers, as evidenced by the 2016 presidential election cycle where hardly any minority group escaped unscathed from discriminatory attacks. Considering how hyper-polarized opinions are now, it's reasonable to wonder if the increase in overt racism will have an impact on interracial marriage.\n\n\"We know there are those people who still believe that intermarriage is wrong,\" said DaCosta. \"A lot of these deeply ingrained beliefs about blacks are that they're too different. And they're different in a negative way.\"\n\nUnpopular views around interracial marriage are felt among blacks too, not just whites, but for different reasons.\n\n\"African Americans can be skeptical of interracial marriage, especially of blacks who have status, wealth and success or some combination of the three, because the message is those blacks think whites are better,\" said Cobb.\n\nSmith - who along with her late husband was a professional horseman and lived a quiet life in Virginia together with their daughter - said she wasn't plagued by racist encounters during her marriage, but there were a few incidents while dating.\n\n\"There will always be a percentage of people who feel the necessity to hate difference no matter where they are from,\" she said. \"Small mindedness and fear seem to go together.\"\n\nBut small minded views are powerful and made national headlines just a few years ago in 2013 when Cheerios debuted a commercial that featured an African-American man, his white wife and their bi-racial daughter. YouTube disabled the comments section, because the remarks were so prejudiced.\n\nRelated: Old Navy Interracial Ad Resurrects Heated Debate\n\nAnd yet those nasty anonymous posts arguably pale in comparison to the real life racist acts amplified last year.\n\nIn 2016, hate crimes were up by 20 percent, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.\n\n\"We absolutely can regress,\" said DaCosta. \"When you have political figures in positions of power with access to the mic, what they say has an effect. And that boundary of black verses white is still pretty firm.\"\n\nSmith is hopeful that tolerance of interracial marriages will continue, despite heightened rhetoric. \"Unfortunately one generation can influence the next but I think the general trend will be towards more acceptance,\" she said. \"Prejudice is a fascinating social phenomenon. I think it will be with us always.\"\n\nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram\n\nAlexis Clark is a freelance journalist and adjunct professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Interracial marriage still rising in U.S.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nMelting pot or racial divide? The growth of interracial marriages is slowing among U.S.-born Hispanics and Asians. Still, blacks are substantially more likely than before to marry whites.\n\nThe number of interracial marriages in the U.S. has risen 20 percent since 2000 to about 4.5 million, according to the latest census figures. While still growing, that number is a marked drop-off from the 65 percent increase between 1990 and 2000.\n\nAbout 8 percent of U.S. marriages are mixed-race, up from 7 percent in 2000.\n\nThe latest trend belies notions of the U.S. as a post-racial, assimilated society. Demographers cite a steady flow of recent immigration that has given Hispanics and Asians more ethnically similar partners to choose from while creating some social distance from whites due to cultural and language differences.\n\nWhite wariness toward a rapidly growing U.S. minority population also may be contributing to racial divisions, experts said.\n\n\"Racial boundaries are not going to disappear anytime soon,\" said Daniel Lichter, a professor of sociology and public policy at Cornell University. He noted the increase in anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S. after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks as well as current tensions in Arizona over its new immigration law.\n\n\"With a white backlash toward immigrant groups, some immigrants are more likely to turn inward to each other for support,\" Lichter said.\n\nBroken down by race, about 40 percent of U.S.-born Asians now marry whites - a figure unchanged since 1980. Their likelihood of marrying foreign-born Asians, meanwhile, multiplied 3 times for men and 5 times for women, to roughly 20 percent.\n\nAmong U.S.-born Hispanics, marriages with whites increased modestly from roughly 30 percent to 38 percent over the past three decades. But when it came to marriages with foreign-born Hispanics, the share doubled - to 12.5 percent for men, and 17.1 percent for women.\n\nIn contrast, blacks are now three times as likely to marry whites than in 1980. About 14.4 percent of black men and 6.5 percent of black women are currently in such mixed marriages, due to higher educational attainment, a more racially integrated military and a rising black middle class that provides more interaction with other races.\n\nThe numbers reflect in part an internal struggle that Asians and Hispanics say they feel navigating two cultural worlds - the U.S. and their parents' homeland.\n\nHai Nguyen, 37, of Houston recalls the instant connection she felt after meeting her first Vietnamese boyfriend, Greg, in college. Nguyen says while she had to explain herself to white boyfriends, with Greg it was a feeling that \"he so gets me, because we eat the same food, we like the same things, our families know each other and there is so little that needs to be said.\"\n\n'My parents have prejudices, but they've accepted it' With the enthusiastic support of her parents, she and Greg married. But their connection soon began to fade, due partly to Nguyen's budding career as a business analyst, which clashed with more traditional expectations for her to \"always have fresh food on the table.\" The two divorced and Nguyen is now remarried to Jon, who is white.\n\n\"My parents have prejudices, but they've accepted it,\" said Nguyen. She described occasionally feeling different with her parents and other single-race couples. \"They know it's inevitable. My native tongue will eventually fade, and history will take its course.\"\n\nThe demographic shifts can complicate conventional notions of racial identity.\n\n'Multi' label shunned Due to increasing interracial marriages, multiracial Americans are a small but fast-growing demographic group, making up about 5 percent of the minority population. Together with blacks, Hispanics and Asians, the Census Bureau estimates they collectively will represent a majority of the U.S. population by mid-century.\n\nStill, many multiracial people - particularly those who are part black - shun a \"multi\" label in favor of identifying as a single race.\n\nBy some estimates, two-thirds of those who checked the single box of \"black\" on the census form are actually mixed, including President Barack Obama, who identified himself as black in the 2010 census even though his mother was white.\n\nCensus figures also show:\n\nJuan Thurman, 37, a Houston sales account manager, says both family pressure and a strong ethnic identity weighed heavily on him as a Hispanic when he was dating, even as he found himself interacting more with other races in school.\n\nIn high school and at Rice University, Thurman said, he had fewer opportunities to meet Hispanic women in his honors classes. Ultimately, he married Emily, who is white, based on shared life views of gender equity and a liberal outlook toward religion. He relishes having friends of many different backgrounds.\n\n\"Interracial marriage is not a big deal,\" Thurman said. \"Still, from a family standpoint, I did feel culturally different and I continue to feel so.\"\n\nThe figures come from previous censuses as well as the 2008 American Community Survey, which surveys 3 million households. The figures for \"white\" refer to those whites who are not of Hispanic ethnicity. For purposes of defining interracial marriages, Hispanic is counted as a race.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Vance said Tuesday that he doesn't support federal legislation to codify protections for same-sex and interracial marriage , calling it a \"bizarre distraction\" from other issues.\n\nThe bill, which passed the U.S. House last month, would require federal recognition of all marriages as long as they were deemed valid in the state they were performed. It would also repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the Ohio State Fair, Vance characterized the bill as a solution in search of a problem.\n\n\"You have a sky-high inflation crisis, you have a huge recessionary problem, and we're arguing about rights that have already been granted by the Supreme Court,\" he said. \"It seems like a bizarre distraction for a country that actually has much, much deeper and more serious crises.\"\n\nVance also argued that the proposal raises religious liberty concerns and doesn't balance marriage equality with the rights of churches or nonprofits to operate according to their values.\n\nHouse Democrats pushed for a vote on the bill last month amid concerns about how the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade could affect other constitutional rights.

      "text": "Happy Loving Day. Here's how Richard and Mildred Loving upended interracial marriage bans\n\nWASHINGTON - A Virginia judge gave Richard and Mildred Loving a choice in 1958: The couple could serve a year in jail for violating a state ban on interracial marriage or they could move away for 25 years.\n\nThe Lovings opted for a third choice: They appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn a decision celebrated every June 12 as Loving Day, the nation's highest court ruled that bans on interracial marriage that were in place in 16 states at the time violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The day is named for the landmark decision, Loving v. Virginia.\n\n\"Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the state,\" Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote for a unanimous court. \"The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\"\n\nIn the five decades since the decision, interracial marriage has increased dramatically. In 2015, one in six newlyweds had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, which is more than five times higher than the number of intermarried newlyweds in 1967, according to Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nMore than 30 years after the Loving v. Virginia decision, designer Ken Tanabe learned of the monumental ruling while in graduate school at Parsons School of Design. He said he was intrigued by the case because of his own interracial heritage and made it the subject of his graduate thesis project.\n\nThat project grew into Loving Day, a holiday Tanabe said is celebrated around the country and the world. Loving Day has been officially recognized by a handful of states and cities including Virginia, Vermont, New York City and Los Angeles, and civil rights organizations like the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nTanabe said the name is \"not just a reference to a real couple who fought racial injustice, it also represents the love that we give to each other.\"\n\nIn 1958, Mildred Loving got pregnant and the couple traveled to Washington, D.C., to get married. They then returned home to Caroline County, Virginia, and not long after, they were awakened in the middle of the night by policeman who informed them they were breaking the law.\n\nThey were jailed on charges of unlawful cohabitation and offered a choice: Continue to serve jail time or leave Virginia for 25 years. The couple chose the latter and left the state.\n\nIt wasn't my doing,\" Mildred Loving told the Associated Press in 2007. \"It was God's work.\"\n\nRichard Loving died in a car crash 1975. Mildred Loving died in 2008.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, it noted abortion isn't explicitly included in the Constitution. But some advocates pointed out the same is true for many other rights millions of Americans take for granted: The right to same-sex marriage, the right to access contraception, the right to privacy, among others. Those rights were grounded in the 14th Amendment in the same way that abortion was.\n\nAmong those is the right to interracial marriage.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas used a concurring opinion last year to call on the Supreme Court to \"reconsider\" some of those rights established by the high court. Thomas, who is himself in an interracial marriage, didn't mention the Loving decision among those he thought worth revisiting - an omission that was noted by his critics.\n\nThe court's majority opinion by Justice Sam Alito said the difference is that none of the other precedents involved the \"critical moral question posed by abortion.\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh also mentioned Loving in a concurrence in last year's abortion decision, asserting that the precedent and others like it would remain in place.\n\n\"I emphasize what the court today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents,\" Kavanaugh wrote.\n\nContributing: Associated Press"

Mike Braun said during a media call Tuesday that the U.S. Supreme Court was wrong to legalize interracial marriage decades ago.\n\nThat decision should have been left to individual states, he said.\n\nFive hours later, Braun released a statement saying he misunderstood \"a line of questioning,\" and emphasized that he condemns racism \"in any form.\"\n\nDuring the press call earlier Tuesday, Braun was asked about the landmark Loving v. Virginia court case after he explained he thought abortion rights questions should have been left up to the states back when Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973.  Mandating abortion access was judicial activism, Braun said, adding that individual states should instead be able to decide how restrictive abortion access should be.\n\nA reporter then asked if he applied the same reasoning to the Supreme Court's decision in 1967 that struck down state laws banning interracial marriage under the 14th amendment, which guarantees all citizens equal protection under the law.\n\n\"When it comes to issues, you can't have it both ways,\" Braun said. \"When you want that diversity to shine within our federal system, there are going to be rules and proceedings, they're going to be out of sync with maybe what other states would do. It's the beauty of the system, and that's where the differences among points of view in our 50 states ought to express themselves.\"\n\nBraun doubled down when asked to clarify if he would be OK with leaving the decision of whether to allow interracial marriage up to states. After all, states had decided to make interracial marriage illegal.\n\n\"Yes, I think that that's something that if you're not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too,\" Braun responded. \"I think that's hypocritical.\"\n\nHours later Braun backtracked in a written statement sent to media.\n\n\"Earlier during a virtual press conference I misunderstood a line of questioning that ended up being about interracial marriage,\" Braun said. \"Let me be clear on that issue - there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form, at all levels and by any states, entities, or individuals.\"\n\nAccording to Pew Research , 11% of all married adults in the U.S. had a spouse who was a different race or ethnicity from them in 2019. The rate is higher among newlyweds.\n\nMike Schmuhl, chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party, slammed Braun for his remarks earlier in the day.\n\n\"Mike Braun's words and views are not only un-American, but beneath any respectable person wishing to hold public office,\" Schmuhl said. \"The United States Supreme Court has affirmed many times that marriage equality in our country extends to any committed couple regardless of sex, race, orientation, or religious affiliation, and to question that legitimacy questions the very fabric of America and its people.\"\n\nBraun often advocates for individual state's rights. For example, he was opposed to President Biden's vaccine mandates for private businesses.\n\nThe Supreme Court is poised to rule on a controversial Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks in the coming months. That decision could threaten key components of the longstanding Roe v. Wade decision.\n\nIndiana lawmakers have asked Gov. Eric Holcomb to call a taxpayer-funded special legislative session if parts of Roe v. Wade are overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Kaitlin Lange at 317-432-9270.

      "text": "Kelly: Marriage Act a political ploy, says same-sex, interracial marriage 'law of the land'\n\nA bipartisan bill aimed at protecting the right of same-sex and interracial couples to marry passed the U.S. House of Representatives Tuesday amid concerns that the U.S. Supreme Court could roll back additional decisions following its overturning of the landmark abortion law Roe v. Wade last month.\n\nThe bill, the Respect for Marriage Act, passed 267 to 157, with 47 Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues. All of the opposition came from Republicans, including U.S. Reps. Mike Kelly, of Butler, R-16th Dist. and Glenn Thompson, of Howard Township, R-15th Dist., and four other Pennsylvania House members.\n\n\"It's very important for the American people to understand that same-sex marriage is already the law of the land. The 2015 Supreme Court case, Obergefell v. Hodges, made that very clear,\" Kelly said in a statement.\"With just 16 days left in session before Election Day, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats are forcing the House of Representatives to vote on bills that are already law so they can create a false narrative and deflect from their failed economic and energy policies, which are costing Americans more and more money.\"\n\n\"This bill was nothing more than an election-year messaging stunt for Democrats in Congress who have failed to address historic inflation and out-of-control prices at gas pumps and grocery stores,\" Maddison Stone, a spokesperson for Thompson, said.\n\nBut Alex Sphon, president of the NWPA Pride Alliance , said those statements ignore recent comments by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who said he believes the court erred in 2015 and Justice Clarence Thomas, who in his concurring opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling, said the court should reexamine the marriage case and others.\n\n\"We've only enjoyed the right to be able to marry who we want for a little over seven years now,\" Sphon said. \"Our (LGBTQ) community right now is very scared that we're going to see that go away. Even in those seven years, we've faced constant attacks, different parts of our community. In particular, Black trans women are still being murdered and that's not really getting any attention. These Republicans that voted against (the Respect for Marriage Act), they clearly don't value us as a community. So seeing these rights potentially eroded away and by having somebody like that vote against it, certainly sends shockwaves through the community. I'm really scared about it.\"\n\nThe bill, which now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain outcome, would repeal the 1996 \"Defense of Marriage Act,\" which said that states do not have to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere and codified that the federal government would only recognize marriages between opposite-sex couples.\n\nThe bill is a preemptive measure aimed at upholding the marriage rights provided to same-sex couples nationwide in the 2015 Supreme Court decision, Obergefell v. Hodges. The court's 2015 ruling came two years after it had thrown out the \"Defense of Marriage Act\" and several years after it had thrown out anti-sodomy laws in states like Texas.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act would also prohibit states from enacting laws against interracial marriage, which the high court struck down in the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia.\n\nThose decisions - Obergefell, Loving and Roe - were all based on the equal protection clause or the due process cause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nDemocrats and other proponents of abortion rights fear that the conservative-majority court will also strip other federal protections that it had previously afforded to same-sex and interracial couples, as well as the right to contraception.\n\nBefore the Obergefell case, some 30 states had laws on the books that banned same-sex marriage, just as several states banned interracial marriage before the Loving decision.\n\nKelly and Thompson were joined in their opposition to the bill by fellow Pennsylvania Congress members Reps. Guy Reschenthaler, John Joyce, Fred Keller and Lloyd Smucker.\n\nPennsylvania Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Dan Meuser and Scott Perry were among the 47 Republicans to break with their party and support the bill.\n\nSphon said LGBTQ voters have been even more energized for the upcoming midterm elections since the Roe v. Wade ruling.\n\n\"Even with this (Respect for Marriage) act and everything that they're doing now, there are other issues that still need a lot of work,\" Sphon said. \"By going out and voting in November, that's a big way to make sure that our voices are heard.\"\n\nKelly on Thursday voted \"present\" on a bill about protecting at the federal level access to contraceptives, which was also proposed in anticipation of the U.S. Supreme Court potentially reconsidering previous cases. Asked on Friday why he voted \"present\" on one bill and \"no\" on the other, Kelly said:\n\n\"After that first vote, I said why are we falling into this pattern that we are going to object to things that are already on the books and law, in order for the Democrats to somehow change the nation's view of what's happening in the country right now?\" he said. \"It's a distraction. It had nothing to do with real legislation.\"\n\nContact Matthew Rink at mrink@timesnews.com or on Twitter at @ETNRink ."

      "text": "This Is America: Why love isn't colorblind\n\nLove is blind, they say, and maybe it is a little.\n\nMy husband, Dan, doesn't really seem to notice or care when my hair is a mess or I'm wearing my shabbiest (but oh-so-comfortable) sweatshirt. He averts his eyes when I leave dishes in the sink, gently teases if I leave books everywhere.\n\nHe's not alone. I shrug when he leaves doors open, chuckle to myself when he absently wears his shirt inside-out.\n\nBut my husband never pretends he doesn't see my race or that it doesn't matter. He is white, and I am Black.\n\nHi, there, I'm Felecia Wellington Radel , engagement editor, focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion at USA TODAY, and I'd like to welcome you to this week's \"This Is America,\" a newsletter about race, identity and how they shape our lives.\n\nOur marriage was made possible in part by a 1967 Supreme Court decision - Loving v. Virginia - and the couple at the center of the case, Richard and Mildred Loving, a white man and Black woman.\n\nThe court's ruling struck down bans against interracial marriage in 16 states. The state I live in wasn't one that had anti-interracial marriage laws, but the landmark case has protected our right to marry and the freedom to travel and live anywhere in the nation.\n\nNow, Loving Day is celebrated on June 12, the anniversary of the historic court decision.\n\nAnd interracial or interethnic marriages are becoming more common. About 13% of millennials are married to someone who is a different racial or ethnic background, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nMy husband is a college professor for both history and journalism, as well as a newspaper journalist. Through friendship, dating, then eventually marriage and becoming parents, we've always had deep conversations.\n\nMarriage is, perhaps unsurprisingly, composed of a lot of conversation and compromise. It's also a lot of closing doors and turning off lights, but I digress.\n\nThe educational intimacies of marriage don't stop when the wedding is over, yet continues throughout the journey together. Winding your life with someone else and adding a family to it means being able to talk, to support each other and to know you're being seen and heard.\n\nAnd tackling tough subjects is important, but it doesn't stop at talking about finances or future plans. We must talk about race, what it means to us and also what we are experiencing. But it isn't just the overt examples of discrimination, like the time I was called the \"N-word\" in front of him during a road rage incident when the driver of another car took his frustration out on me, even though I wasn't even driving.\n\nWe talk about microaggressions, history, politics, social justice. When it comes to our children, we talk about not only safety and prejudice but also the very concept of race, the legacies and lore, the triumphs and tragedies. Where many become uncomfortable in conversations about racism and race, we openly discuss it all the time, no blinking.\n\nDan doesn't center himself in narratives that aren't his, he doesn't perform anti-racism. He researches, asks, learns and teaches. He makes sure my voice, and those of others, are being heard.\n\nHe knows I am Black. He knows it's part of who I am, that I'm proud of my Blackness, that me speaking my truth is important.\n\nI know he's white. I know his dreams, his background, his successes. I didn't assume he wouldn't understand me or my culture.\n\nI wasn't sure how some difficult conversations would go at first, how his family might react, how we would approach raising biracial children.  As the world around us has changed over our years together, so too have the challenges we face. We discuss all of it, learn from each other, understand each other, see each other.\n\nNot \"seeing color\" means ignoring a part of someone's culture, heritage, beauty. They live with their color all day, live with meanings assigned to their race or ethnicity - positive and negative. Having an option to be blind to it is a social privilege not all can attain.\n\nAnd most importantly, my husband doesn't fetishize Blackness either. I am not a token, some Black culture trophy.\n\nOnly seeing a person's color - often a declaration riddled with stereotypes (e.g. \"I only date Black women,\" \"I love rap music\") is no compliment either. Doing so is blindness to that person's individuality.\n\nI see him, an ally, hero of a husband and fantastic father. He sees me and none of the prejudice or politics, just the magic.\n\n--\n\nThis is America is a weekly take on current events from a rotating panel of USA TODAY Network journalists with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints.

      "text": "'A blow against hate': Biden signs landmark bill protecting same-sex, interracial marriage\n\nWASHINGTON - President Joe Biden signed historic legislation Tuesday protecting same-sex marriages nationally , marking a major milestone in the fight for gay rights that follows a seismic change in the nation's attitudes.\n\nAt a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act , making it the law that all states recognize same-sex and interracial marriages. Democratic and Republican lawmakers, LGBTQ advocates and plaintiffs in marriage equality cases were among the thousands in attendance.\n\n\"Today, America takes a vital step toward equality, toward liberty and justice, not just for some, but for everyone,\" Biden said. \"Toward creating a nation where decency, dignity, and love are recognized, honored and protected.\"\n\nThe new law will protect same-sex marriages if the Supreme Court were to overturn the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision, which in 2015 legalized same-sex marriages in the U.S.\n\nBiden said the new law confers to all married couples the federal protections that come with marriage such as legal recognition as \"next of kin\" when a spouse is ill.\n\n\"For most of our nation's history, we denied interracial couples and same-sex couples from these protections,\" the president said. \"We failed to treat them with equal dignity and respect. Now the law requires interracial marriage and same-sex marriage must be recognized as legal in every state in the nation.\"\n\nThe push to codify gay and interracial marriage rights in Congress came after Associate Justice Clarence Thomas called on the Supreme Court to \"reconsider\" other rights established by the Supreme Court in the wake of its June ruling that Americans no longer have a right to abortion.\n\nThomas, in a concurring opinion backing the overturning of Roe v. Wade, singled out opinions that blocked states from banning contraception, sex by same-sex couples and gay marriage.\n\nFollowing the bill's passage in the House, Biden pointed to \"uncertainty\" after the Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe, saying the new law restores a \"measure of security to millions of marriages and families.\"\n\nBetween 2,000 and 3,000 lawmakers and advocates attended the signing ceremony on the South Lawn on Tuesday, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\"Passing the Respect for Marriage Act wasn't just the right thing to do for America. It was personal to us, to our staff and our families. And it's certainly personal to me,\" Schumer said. \"The tie I am wearing reminds me what this moment is all about. It's the tie I wore on the day my daughter got married to a beautiful young lady, one of the happiest days of my life.\"\n\nThe ceremony was also star-studded, featuring performances from singers Sam Smith - who is nonbinary - and Cyndi Lauper, who sang \"Stay With Me\" and \"True Colors\" respectively. Dozens of past plaintiffs in lawsuits who fought for marriage equality watched the ceremony from the White House steps.\n\nLauper, who has advocated for LGBTQ rights, thanked the president and those who helped get the bill passed.\n\n\"We can rest easy tonight because our families are validated,\" Lauper said during a special appearance at the White House press briefing. \"Now we're allowed to love who we love.\"\n\nFor Biden, his signature on the legislation strengthens a reputation as the most pro-LGBTQ president in U.S. history - a legacy that started when, as vice president in May 2012, Biden got ahead of his boss, President Barack Obama, by saying he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with men marrying men or women marrying women.\n\n\"What this is all about a simple proposition. Who do you love?\" Biden said at the time during an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nBiden recalled that moment during Tuesday's remarks - \"I got in trouble,\" he joked - and asked the same question from 10 years ago: \"Who do you love? And will you be loyal to that person you love?\"\n\nHe added: \"It's not more complicated than that. This law recognizes that everyone should have the right to answer those questions for themselves without the government interfering.\"\n\nThere were about 710,000 married same-sex couple households in the U.S. in 2021, and about 500,000 unmarried same-sex couple households, according to data from the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey.\n\nThe new law does not require that states issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples but that they accept the legitimacy of valid marriages performed elsewhere.\n\nThe legislation cleared the House last week in a 258-169 vote, with 39 Republicans joining all Democrats, and passed the Senate 61-39, with 12 Republicans voting in favor.\n\nThe bipartisan votes reflect a rapid sea change in views about same-sex marriage, which even many Democrats were reluctant to support a decade ago.\n\nBiden concluded his remarks by pointing to more societal challenges ahead: \"When a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon, this is still wrong,\" he said.\n\nBiden voiced his support for legislation that would expand federal civil rights laws to LGBTQ people and said \"we must stop the hate and violence\" on display in last month's shooting at an LGBTQ bar in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that left five dead and many more wounded. He also called out the \"hundreds of callous, cynical\" bills introduced in many states targeting transgender people.\n\n\"The antidote to hate is love,\" the president said. \"This law and the love it defends strikes a blow against hate in all its forms.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison."

      "text": "'We all deserve the right': Inside the Ohio push to protect interracial, same-sex marriages\n\nOhio Democrats and LGBTQ advocates are pushing for legislation to enshrine the right to same-sex and interracial marriage amid concerns about future U.S. Supreme Court decisions .\n\nBut the bill is only step one in a complicated process that could unfold if federal marriage protections are ever thrown out.\n\nBoth the Ohio Constitution and Ohio Revised Code recognize marriage only as a union between one man and one woman. Because of the landmark gay marriage ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges - named for the lead plaintiff and Ohioan Jim Obergefell - Ohio's same-sex marriage bans aren't in effect.\n\nHouse Democrats fear that could change any time after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. With that in mind, they unveiled plans Tuesday for legislation that would codify protections in Obergefell and Loving v. Virginia, which established the right to interracial marriage.\n\n\"Knowing that you exist as a lawfully recognized couple, you can't put words to how important that is,\" Obergefell said Tuesday. \"And if you want to form a family, being a married couple is one of those things that helps make that happen for so many people. We all deserve the right, the ability to choose that person we love the most, to commit them, to make our promises to love them and protect them and to have those promises recognized and respected.\"\n\nConcerns about the Obergefell and Loving cases emerged almost immediately after the abortion decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. Roe was grounded in the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process, which also served as the foundation for rulings in both marriage cases.\n\nIn his concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said the decision didn't affect other rights beyond access to abortion. But he suggested the court reconsider Obergefell's precedent in the future, along with cases that overturned sodomy laws and established the right for married people to obtain contraception.\n\n\"We cannot take federal protections for granted as we never know when precedent will be overturned,\" Rep. Jessica Miranda, D-Forest Park, said.\n\nMiranda said House Democrats are talking with Republicans to make the bill bipartisan, so it has yet to be formally introduced. Spokespeople for Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens and Gov. Mike DeWine declined to comment.\n\nBut even if the legislation passes, proponents would have another hurdle to climb: The state's constitution.\n\nNearly 62% of Ohio voters approved an amendment to the state constitution in 2004 declaring: \"Only a union between one man and one woman may be a marriage valid in or recognized by this state and its political subdivisions.\"\n\nIf Obergefell is overturned, the Ohio Constitution would supersede anything in state statute. That means opponents of the ban would need to propose another amendment and put it before voters. The federal Respect for Marriage Act would require Ohio to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states, but not here.\n\nEquality Ohio public policy director Maria Bruno said advocates are currently focused on opposing bills that restrict transgender medical care and bathroom access . But Bruno believes changing the marriage statute is a symbolic step lawmakers can take to begin the conversation, even if the constitution presents another barrier down the road.\n\n\"From a legal enforcement standpoint, we currently are functioning under the Obergefell precedent, and therefore we don't have to worry about that conflict,\" Bruno said. \"If it were to become the case that that is overturned, I've got to tell you that constitutional amendment might not stay there. But in the interim, the Legislature correcting the statutory codes still assists in avoiding confusion and clarifying both our values and the actual current state of the law.\"\n\nHaley BeMiller is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch, Cincinnati Enquirer, Akron Beacon Journal and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio."

Mike Braun is getting national attention after he said that the U.S. Supreme Court should have left the decision of whether to ban interracial marriage up to the states.\n\nFive hours later, Braun released a statement saying he misunderstood \"a line of questioning,\" and emphasized that he condemns racism \"in any form.\"\n\n\"Earlier during a virtual press conference I misunderstood a line of questioning that ended up being about interracial marriage,\" Braun said. \"Let me be clear on that issue - there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form, at all levels and by any states, entities, or individuals.\"\n\nHere's a transcript of what he said about the Supreme Court during a press call Tuesday. Unrelated questions were not included:\n\nAnswer: I have not met her. I think she did that mostly with the folks on the Judiciary Committee. Of course, you can't miss the topic. Seems well qualified, but whenever I vote for a Supreme Court justice is going to be basically how are you going to interpret the law. If your record shows that you're going to be kind of an activist there, I don't think that's good, I don't think the founders intended it that way. I'm going to look at what's fleshed out in terms of prior rulings at a lower level, and I think that'll be done thoroughly, and I think our side that is going to be doing some of that extraction of information based upon your record, we'll do it in a way that I think hopefully keeps it a little different level of decorum than the one I remember back when I was running in I think October of 18 with Kavanagh. Stick with interpreting the law, don't legislate from the bench, and what has your prior record shown about what you'll do when you're on the main stage.\n\nAnswer: I'm going to wait until the whole process finishes itself out. Of course in this day of information, you get a lot ahead of time and I think she'll have to do a pretty strong explanation of why her record and maybe what her judicial tendency might be, to say the opposite of what I said will be the most important criteria for me.\n\nAnswer: Well, I don't think there'll be any Democrat voting against her, and I think it remains to be seen, in terms of how much would be brought out along the lines of what I talked about. I think there are probably three or four Republicans that would maybe lean in that direction. But if the case is made, that with prior opinions at lower court levels, and her answers to what she wants to accomplish, they generally are understated if you're talking about judicial activism. Everyone basically in a perfunctory way will say I'm going to be neutral, look at the merits of the case. I think that'll determine whether it's purely a partisan vote or not. We'll see what happens.\n\nAnswer: Well, that would be a question that I think is one that may not be of the analytical kind of context that would hit the mark, but I'm referring back to the absolute bedlam that occurred during the Kavanaugh hearings, and that was a level of decorum that I think most on our side said they would not go there, and I think we'll get to the merits of the case on her capabilities without some of those histrionics.\n\nAnswer: I consider it to have been judicial activism when it occurred back almost 50 years ago. So I think this would be bringing it back to a neutral point to where that issue should have never been federalized, way out of sync I think with the contours of America then. And this basically puts it back to a point where, like most of these issues when one side of the aisle wants to homogenize it federally, is not the right way to do it. This should be something where the expression of individual states are able to weigh in on these issues, through their own legislation, through their own court systems. Quit trying to put the federal government in charge of not only things like we did navigating through COVID recently, where I think that was misguided, but in general. So now I think this takes it back to a point where it should have never gotten beyond in the first place.\n\nAnswer: W hen it comes to the issues, you can't have it both ways. When you want that diversity to shine within our federal system, there are going to be rules and proceedings, they're going to be out of sync with maybe what other states would do. It's a beauty of the system, and that's where the differences among points of view in our 50 states ought to express themselves. And I'm not saying that rule would apply in general depending on the topic, but it should mostly be in general, because it's hard to have it on issues that you just are interested in when you deny it for others with a different point of view.\n\nAnswer: Yes, I think that that's something that if you're not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too. I think that's hypocritical.\n\nAnswer: You can list a whole host of issues. When it comes down to whatever they are, I'm going to say that they're not going to all make you happy within a given state, but that we're better off having states manifest their points of view rather than homogenizing it across the country as Roe v. Wade did.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Kaitlin Lange at 317-432-9270 or email her at kaitlin.lange@indystar.com. Follow her on Twitter: @kaitlin_lange ."

Commonwealth, Andrew Kinney was a blacksmith who fell in love with Mahala Miller around 1866. Kinney was black and Miller white, which made their relationship illegal, but they boldly moved in together as husband and wife near Churchville. Their first son, William, was born the following year, and another son, James, two years later.\n\nInterracial Delaware couple ignores critics for nearly 50 years\n\nGet to know Ruth Negga, the Oscar-nominated breakout star of 'Loving'\n\nJust as Richard Loving and Mildred Jeter traveled to Washington, D.C., in 1958 to marry, so did Andrew and Mahala on Nov. 4, 1874, when mixed-race marriages became legal there. After a 10-day honeymoon, they returned to Churchville and had four more boys: John in 1874, Alonzo (who died shortly after birth) in 1875, Tom in 1876 and Harrison in 1877.\n\nBut their quiet life in the foothills of the Alleghany Mountains was interrupted in September 1877 when they were charged with \"lewd and lascivious cohabitation\" and summoned to Augusta County Court for violating Virginia's miscegenation law.\n\nOn Feb. 2, 1878, Kinney and Miller were found guilty of miscegenation and fined $500 each. Their attorney, J. M. Quarles, immediately appealed to the Circuit Court, which affirmed the judgment of the county court, as did the Supreme Court of Appeals.\n\nCourt transcripts show the Kinneys' legal argument: Since they were married in the District of Columbia, where mixed-race marriage was legal, their marriage had to be declared valid once they returned to Virginia. The judge believed otherwise.\n\n\"Upon the whole case, I am of the opinion that the marriage celebrated in the District of Columbia between Andrew Kinney and Mahala Miller, though lawful there ... is invalid here,\" wrote Judge Joseph Christian, \"and that said marriage was a mere evasion of the laws of this state, and cannot be pleaded in bar of a criminal prosecution here.\"\n\nIf Andrew and Mahala wanted to legally remain husband and wife, Christian ruled, they would have to move to a state or country that would recognize their union.\n\n\"Both cases, the Kinneys' and the Lovings', went to the Virginia Supreme Court on appeal,\" says Peter Wallenstein, a professor of history at Virginia Tech and author of two books on the Lovings and the history of laws against interracial marriage. \"Both couples lost there. In a huge difference, though, the Lovings were able to take their case to the U.S. Supreme Court. There, the justices declared such laws as had ensnared the Kinneys and the Lovings no longer enforceable -- as a denial, on the impermissible basis of their racial identities, of a couple's fundamental right to marry.\"\n\nAlthough Andrew and Mahala were out of legal options, they refused to move or split up. She took the last name Kinney, they paid the fines, and they defiantly remained at their Churchville home. The 1880 U.S. Census lists them as still living there with their five sons and with Mahala's sister, Sis Carrol. Census documents list Andrew as black, Mahala as white and their five sons as \"Mu\" for \"mulatto.\"\n\nAfter the Kinney case, Virginia legislators moved to make the penalties for interracial marriage more severe, Wallenstein says. Legislation passed in 1878 not only made interracial marriage a crime, but also made it illegal to leave the state in order to evade the law. Doing so was punishable by two to five years in prison.\n\n\"It is absolutely clear ... that the outcome the Lovings obtained from the high court was not a possibility in the time of the Kinneys,\" Wallenstein says. \"The Lovings' persistence -- and their good luck, including their timing -- put an end to all such laws across America.\" - Dale Brumfield is an author, English professor and digital archaeologist.

      "text": "Opinion: Interracial marriage went from criminal to commonplace. Could it go back?\n\nManage your account\n\nAmerican love stories have a default race: white. If the love story is \"interracial,\" one person is white, and the other person is not. In a standard American rom-com, the only nonwhite characters are the white lead's helpful best friends or underwritten colleagues.\n\nQuincy, a Black man, and I, a South Asian woman, are none of these things.\n\n\"All I could think on the way here is when am I going to kiss you,\" Quincy told me one day in 2009, three weeks after we had met. It was the \"when\" that got me; I was that impatient too.\n\nMore than 50 years earlier, on July 11, 1958, Richard and Mildred Loving woke up around 2 a.m. to find their local sheriff shining a flashlight over them.\n\n\"What are you doing in bed with this woman?\" he demanded of Richard.\n\nRichard was white, and Mildred was black.\n\nThe Lovings were charged with violating Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which criminalized marriage between people classified as \"white\" and \"colored.\" The Lovings took their case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously struck down Virginia's law and ended race-based legal marriage restrictions nationwide on June 12, 1967.\n\nThe date is now recognized by cities, states and organizations across the country as Loving Day. It should be a national holiday.\n\nI'm not sure how the authorities would have regarded Q and me back then - whether we would have been deemed an interracial couple or not. Would they have even cared about our union given that neither of us is white?\n\nWhat I do know is that paranoia about interracial relationships is not unique to white Americans.\n\nEarly 20th century Indian immigrants to the United States, for example, invoked anti-miscegenation rhetoric as a way of establishing their claims to citizenship. Bhagat Singh Thind, a writer and World War I veteran, used the language of caste apartheid to make his own case to the Supreme Court in 1923: \"The high-caste Hindu regards the aboriginal Indian Mongoloid in the same manner as the American regards the Negro, speaking from a matrimonial standpoint.\" His argument was, in short, that as a person of high caste, he was practically white and therefore eligible for citizenship under federal immigration law, which limited naturalization to people of European and African descent.\n\nThind's gambit - to weaponize one kind of discrimination against another - failed. The court ruled against him, and some 50 Indian Americans had their citizenship revoked over the next three years as a result.\n\nFive years after Loving vs. Virginia, my parents, joined by the kind of inter-caste \"love\" marriage that Thind argued against, would come to the United States. Their passage was facilitated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, with which the country opened its doors wider than ever to immigrants of Asian descent, though it prioritized skilled professionals who could contribute to the Space Race and other national priorities: scientists, engineers, doctors.\n\nThe U.S. government's desire to beat the Russians may have played a role in the legislation, while schooling, class and caste privilege made medical and engineering degrees attainable for many Asian immigrants of the period. But it was the civil rights movement led by Black Americans that truly gave these newcomers a shot at a more humane, equitable life here.\n\nAnd yet if it weren't for Loving Day, I'm not sure I would have been aware of the Lovings as civil rights pioneers.\n\nIt was Quincy who pointed me to their story. In 2017, he - by then my husband - found a call for interracial couples to re-create an iconic 1965 image of Richard and Mildred Loving, shot by Grey Villet for Life magazine seven years after their arrest. I suggested we participate.\n\nI always read the photo as showing Mildred in the course of doing something else when Richard scooped her into his arm. The husband's face is tilted toward the camera as he leans in to kiss his wife. Mildred looks busy: Maybe it's her posture, not leaning toward Richard but standing straight; maybe it's her hair, not done up for the camera but in utilitarian bobby pins. It seems to capture a moment of embrace, of love, in the midst of a typical day.\n\nPerhaps that's what made me feel as if we could inhabit this photo. Quincy is always trying to scoop me up while I'm motoring about doing one of 10 million things in a day.\n\nI think that's the power of the photo. America doesn't tend to read race as a love story. Race in America is seen as a story of pain and tragedy. But people are more than pain, more than tragic. Our lives together are ordinary as much as extraordinary.\n\nThat's exactly what Richard and Mildred were fighting for: the right to an ordinary, kissing-amid-the-10-million-things-of-the-day kind of life.\n\nThe Lovings' case would become a precedent for the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell vs. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage in 2015. The court ruled that \"the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and ... couples of the same sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty.\"\n\nThe Pew Research Center found a more than fivefold increase in interracial marriage in the half-century since Loving vs. Virginia, with about 1 in 6 newlyweds married to someone of a different race.\n\nFor me, Loving Day is a testament to the everyday-ness of some civil disobedience. It's also a challenge to the anti-Blackness that addles South Asian communities. From Thind onward, complicity in racism against Black people has been one way South Asians have tried to claim citizenship in America, so anti-Blackness is forever bound up with both assimilation and caste-based oppression.\n\n\"When am I going to kiss you?\" Quincy said. We waited out of politeness, for privacy and to freely express our passion for each other. But that freedom is fragile.\n\nIn their dissent from the 2022 decision overturning Roe vs. Wade, Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor warned that \"no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work,\" calling Roe and Obergefell \"part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decision making over the most personal of life decisions.\"\n\nLike the Lovings, we can't be sure history won't pluck us out of our 10 million things, threatening us with a flashlight from the edge of our bed. Loving Day is not merely to celebrate the past. It's to ensure that a future of freedom for love in all its forms is not an \"if\" but a \"when.\"\n\nNina Sharma is the author of \"The Way You Make Me Feel: Love in Black and Brown.\"\n\nIf it's in the news right now, the L.A.

      "text": "No, Tennessee Has Not Banned Interracial or Same-Sex Marriage\n\nManage your account\n\nSeveral viral social media posts claim that Tennessee has banned same-sex and interracial marriages.\n\n\"Tennessee just passed a bill banning same sex marriage and interracial marriages. Hope you're proud of yourselves MAGA women and white women who couldn't be bothered,\" reads one Threads post . \"Here goes the United States into a Christo-fascist Taliban abyss.\"\n\nA similar post trended this week on Reddit. \"The TN house just passed a bill designed to start a ban on same sex and inter-racial marriages,\" it reads.\n\nThe claim is false. Earlier this year, Tennessee lawmakers passed legislation that allows individuals to decline to perform marriage ceremonies, but it does not ban same-sex or interracial marriage. Existing Supreme Court precedent protects the right to same-sex and interracial marriage nationwide, and in 2022 President Joe Biden signed a bill codifying the right to same-sex marriage into federal law.\n\nIn February 2024, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed House Bill 878, which amended a section of the Tennessee legal code specifying who can legally perform a marriage ceremony in the state. The bill added a single sentence to the section: \"A person shall not be required to solemnize a marriage.\" Under the updated language, no individual-including religious officials, state judges, and county clerks-can be forced to administer a marriage against their will. The bill does not explicitly address same-sex marriage, however, the clause allows officials to refuse to perform a marriage for any reason, including religious objections.\n\nWhile the updated Tennessee law would allow a public or religious official to refuse to personally participate in a marriage ceremony for any reason, states cannot universally deny the right to marry to same-sex or interracial couples. The court ruled in the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia that restrictions on interracial marriage violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nIn 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects marriage as a fundamental liberty, including the right to same-sex marriage. In December 2022, President Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act , which further engrained broad protections for same-sex and interracial marriage into federal law.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Why Justice Jackson invoked interracial marriage in Supreme Court's historic transgender care arguments\n\nManage your account\n\nThe Supreme Court was more than an hour into its feisty debate over gender-affirming care when Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson invoked one of the most significant civil rights precedents in the nation's history.\n\nA liberal named to the court by President Joe Biden two years ago, Jackson said she was \"suddenly quite worried\" about how the arguments over Tennessee's ban on transgender care were unfolding and she pointed to the court's seminal 1967 decision in Loving v. Virginia that struck down a state ban on interracial marriage.\n\n\"I'm getting kind of nervous,\" Jackson said at one point. \"I'm worried that we're undermining the foundations of some of our bedrock equal protection cases.\"\n\nA unanimous Supreme Court was able to wade into a messy equal protection fight back then and arrive at one of the court's most important decisions, Jackson seemed to be saying. Why, then, couldn't it do so now when confronted with one of today's most pressing civil rights issues?\n\n\"I wonder whether Virginia could have gotten away with what they did\" if state officials then had made an argument similar to the one Tennessee put to the court Wednesday in defending its ban on gender-affirming care for minors, Jackson said.\n\nIt was a particularly poignant moment in the argument over Tennessee's law, in part because the question came from the Supreme Court's first Black female justice - who is in an interracial marriage - but also because it subtly tied the transgender appeal to the court's blockbuster decision two years ago to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe court's ruling in Loving rejected the state's arguments for why its ban on interracial marriage passed constitutional muster. The state had said that since the ban applied to both White and Black people, it didn't treat either group differently based on race. It also said the court should defer to the state on the issue given countervailing scientific views.\n\nTennessee's argument for defending its ban on gender-affirming care is similar, Jackson pointed out. The state says its law does not discriminate based on sex because it applies equally to both boys and girls who are seeking to transition. And worrying to Jackson is that several of her conservative colleagues signaled that perhaps courts shouldn't be involved in deciding those complicated issues .\n\n\"It prohibits all boys and girls from transitioning using certain medical treatments, and it doesn't say only boys can do so or only girls could do so,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.\n\nJackson, however, was forceful in her view that there are \"parallels\" between the Tennessee law at issue in the transgender health care case and the Virginia ban struck down nearly than 60 years ago, including in the states' arguments for why it should be given legal deference.\n\n\"Some of these questions about sort of who decides and the concerns and legislative prerogatives, et cetera, sound very familiar to me,\" Jackson told US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration before the high court. \"They sound in the same kinds of arguments that were made back in the day, '50s, '60s, with respect to racial classifications and inconsistencies.\"\n\nHeading into the arguments, progressives sounded the alarm about how far the high court might go in reversing major civil rights jurisprudence that have been part of the American legal landscape for decades.\n\nThose fears were inflamed two years ago when conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's second Black justice who is also in an interracial marriage, suggested that his colleagues should \"reconsider\" major decisions dealing with gay marriage, contraception and intimate relations between same-sex couples.\n\nThomas' concurrence came attached to the court's controversial decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned the constitutional right to abortion the court had established in Roe nearly five decades earlier. Thomas did not mention Loving in his concurrence - an omission that drew notice from many of his critics.\n\nThe Dobbs decision did not rest on the Constitution's equal protection clause, and its author - conservative Justice Samuel Alito - tried to make clear that it would not impact those earlier cases guaranteeing a federal right to an interracial or same-sex marriage.\n\nBut the court's three liberal justices wrote in dissent that the majority's opinion does make those rights vulnerable to attack - a warning that Jackson amplified on Wednesday.\n\nAs the arguments turned toward their conclusion Wednesday, Jackson appeared to recognize that a majority of the court seemed prepared to support the Tennessee law - and, in her view, withdraw from history.\n\n\"I share your concerns, Justice Jackson,\" Chase Strangio, the lawyer representing the transgender youth, said in response. \"That would undermine decades of this court's precedent.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com"

      "text": "Interracial marriages to get added protection under new law\n\nManage your account\n\nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) - One day in the 1970s, Paul Fleisher and his wife were walking through a department store parking lot when they noticed a group of people looking at them. Fleisher, who is white, and his wife, who is Black, were used to \"the look.\" But this time it was more intense.\n\n\"There was this white family who was just staring at us, just staring holes in us,\" Fleisher recalled.\n\nThat fraught moment occurred even though any legal uncertainty about the validity of interracial marriage had ended a decade earlier - in 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down state laws banning marriages between people of different races.\n\nIn the more than half-century since, interracial marriage has become more common and far more accepted. So Fleisher was surprised that Congress felt the need to include an additional protection in the Respect for Marriage Act, which was given final approval in a House vote Thursday. It ensures that not only same-sex marriages, but also interracial marriages, are enshrined in federal law.\n\nThe 74-year-old Fleisher, a retired teacher and children's book author, attended segregated public schools in the 1950s in the then-Jim Crow South, and later saw what he called \"token desegregation\" in high school, when four Black students were in his senior class of about 400 students.\n\nHe and his wife, Debra Sims Fleisher, 73, live outside Richmond, about 50 miles from Caroline County, where Mildred Jeter, a Black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, were arrested and charged in 1958 with marrying out of state and returning to Virginia, where interracial marriage was illegal. Their challenge to the law led to Loving v. Virginia, the landmark ruling that ended bans against interracial marriages .\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act, which passed the Senate l ast week, had been picking up steam since June, when the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to an abortion . That ruling included a concurring opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas that suggested the high court should review other precedent-setting rulings, including the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nWhile much of the attention has been focused on protections for same-sex marriages, interracial couples say they are glad Congress also included protections for their marriages, even though their right to marry was well-established decades ago.\n\n\"It's a little unnerving that these things where we made such obvious progress are now being challenged or that we feel we have to really beef up the bulwark to keep them in place,\" said Ana Edwards, a historian who lives in Richmond.\n\nEdwards, 62, who is Black, and her husband, Phil Wilayto, 73, who is white, have been married since 2006. Both have been community activists for years and said they didn't consider interracial marriage a potentially vulnerable institution until the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion.\n\n\"That reminds all of us that whatever rights we have in this society are conditional - they can be taken away,\" said Wilayto. \"The fact that Congress had to take up this issue in 2022 should be a stark reminder of that fact for us.\"\n\nFor younger interracial couples, the thought that their right to marry could ever be threatened is a foreign concept.\n\n\"We never in our wildest dreams thought we would need to be protected as an interracial couple,\" said Derek Mize, a 42-year-old white attorney who lives in an Atlanta suburb with his husband, Jonathan Gregg, 41, who is Black, and their two children.\n\nAs a same-sex couple, they were at the forefront of the long struggle for acceptance and felt the elation that followed the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage across the country.\n\nStill, they see the need for new protections for interracial marriages as well.\n\n\"We're really relieved that there is this law,\" Mize said. \"Protections through the courts and protections through the legislation certainly helps us sleep better at night.\"\n\nMize said he remembers studying Loving v. Virginia in law school and thought then that it was \"ridiculous\" that there had to be litigation over marriages between people of different races. But after he read the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, he said: \"Who knows where it will stop?\"\n\nGregg, a management consultant, said he sees the Respect for Marriage Act as \"an added level of safety\" for same-sex and interracial marriages - a federal law and Supreme Court rulings supporting their right to marry.\n\n\"You've got two ways to be OK,\" he said. \"They have to take down both of them in order for your marriage to fall apart.\"\n\nAngelo Villagomez, a 44-year-old senior fellow at the think tank Center for American Progress, said it was \"unthinkable\" that his marriage could become illegal. Villagomez, who is of mixed white and Indigenous Mariana Islands descent, and his wife, Eden Villagomez, 38, who is Filipina, live in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, \"it feels like some of those things that have just been taken for granted ... are under threat,\" said Villagomez, whose parents, also a mixed-race couple, were married in the 1970s, not long after the Loving decision.\n\nVillagomez worries about what could come next. \"If we don't put a stop to some of this backsliding, this country is gonna go to a very dark place,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm worried about what else is on the chopping block.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Claire Savage contributed to this report from Chicago.\n\n___\n\nSavage is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

      "text": "Decision Destroying Roe Threatens Legal Right To Interracial Marriage, Experts Warn\n\nManage your account\n\nThe legal right not only to same-sex marriage but also to interracial marriage - which reaches even further back in American history - is now at risk with the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade and its profound upending of decades of basic rights, experts warn.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, whose own marriage is interracial, said in remarks Friday that the decision \"calls into question other rights that we thought were settled , such as the right to use birth control, the right to same-sex marriage, the right to interracial marriage.\"\n\nThe possibility of the loss of the right to marry someone of another race was ominously raised when Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said in March that such a right should be left up to the states (as abortion is now). Following backlash, he retracted his statement, claiming he had misunderstood the question. Such a decision would mean that an interracial couple legally married in one state could be arrested while visiting another.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision Friday compared the Roe ruling to cases such as Obergefell v. Hodges, which guaranteed the right to marriage equality; Loving v. Virginia, which protected interracial marriage; Griswold v. Connecticut, which established the right for married couples to use contraception; and Lawrence v. Texas, which prohibited states from banning sexual relations between people of the same sex.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas suggested Friday in a solo concurring opinion that the court should reexamine other rights protected under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\n\"We should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\" Thomas wrote. \"Because any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous,' we have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents.\"\n\nThomas sidestepped the Loving case, which, if overturned as Roe was, could threaten his own interracial marriage. That doesn't mean other justices wouldn't toss out protections, despite any protestations they might make. Some of the justices had previously claimed they believed that Roe v. Wade was settled law.\n\nThe bottom line is, \"what we see today is that there is very little that is sacred in terms of privacy ,\" Michele Goodwin, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Irvine, told Insider.\n\nGoodwin sees the ruling, and Thomas's comments, as a dog whistle to the states to have at it.\n\n\"The Supreme Court doesn't have to engage itself with dismantling protections for interracial marriage. By sending the signal with Roe and by Justice Thomas undergirding that signal, it's now left to the county clerks,\" she warned.\n\nJune 12 marked the 55th anniversary of the landmark Loving decision, which made interracial marriage legal across the U.S. A podcast by the American Civil Liberties Union warned in March, after a draft of the Roe opinion by Justice Samuel Alito emerged, that the \"same legal reasoning\" could be used to overturn Loving.\n\n\"To those who say Loving v. Virginia will never be overturned, be cautious and vigilant,\" warned ACLU podcast host Kendall Ciesemier. \"The United States has a long history of criminalizing, surveilling and controlling Black and brown families and the mixing of races.\"\n\nBased on the ruling overturning Roe, it's difficult not to fear that other rights will be \"subject to the same kind of judicial scrutiny and dismantling , such as contraceptive access, such as same-sex marriage, such as interracial marriage,\" warned Goodwin, who was the guest on the podcast.\n\nSupreme Court strikes down Roe v.

The young woman was working as a clerk at an insurance market when she met Khama, an international student living in a nearby hostel who would quickly become the love of her life, according to the Guardian .\n\nLittle did she know at the time that he would become the first president of an independent Botswana, a landlocked country in the heart of southern Africa , and she Botswana's first lady. But the two would have to overcome death threats, including from their own family, and multiple obstacles meant to block their marriage before they could lead the country through massive progress and change , including the negotiation of Botswana's sovereignty, universal education and a multiracial democracy.\n\nInterracial dating is becoming increasingly accepted in United States society, though it's still far from the norm. Pew Research Center reported a record high 12% of Americans wed someone of a different race in 2013. Almost all millennials accept interracial dating and marriage, representing a change in attitude among the younger generations. Khama and Williams broke boundaries and fought for tolerance in an intolerant world - and ended up leading a country.\n\nWithout couples like Mildred and Richard Loving, for example, interracial marriage would still be illegal in America. The newlyweds had gone to sleep on July 11, 1958, when three police officers stormed their Virginia home and arrested the two for their marriage in Washington, D.C., a few weeks prior , according to Biography.com . The two were forced to wed in D.C. due to their Virginia's Racial Integrity Act , which deemed marriage was only acceptable when it was between people of the same color.\n\n\" As long as you live you will be known as a felon,\" the judge told Mildred Loving after the two were charged with defying the law, according to PBS . The couple moved to Washington, D.C., where they began working on Loving v. Virginia with the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1967 the United States Supreme Court determined any state law meant to block interracial marriages was unconstitutional.\n\nIt took America until the turn of the century for the prohibition of interracial marriage to officially end, when Alabama repealed its discriminatory law in 2000, according to PBS.\n\nWhen Louie Bellson became Duke Ellington's first white band member in 1951, marrying Pearl Bailey after falling in love with the fellow musician likely complicated his career even further, and the two were forced to lie about her heritage throughout southern U.S. states, claiming Bailey was Haitian, according to AFK Insider .\n\nHowever, the two persisted in the music industry and were married for 38 years before Bellson's death in 2009, according to Listverse . Pearl Bailey embedded herself in the Republican party; Bailey served as the United Nations' Goodwill Ambassador for several Republican presidents. Bailey even remained a member of the party, where she found acceptance for her interracial marriage, during the civil rights movement throughout the 1960s.\n\nThe fight for interracial marriage dates as far back as many other civil rights issues - just look at the story of Frederick Douglass, a slave-turned-social-reformer, and his wife Helen Pitts, a suffragist and abolitionist. The two didn't only have to fight for the acceptance of their love, according to AFK Insider : They each took part in fighting against slavery and for women's rights.\n\nT he relationship was shrouded in controversy from the very beginning, however. Here's an excerpt from when the New York Times announced the marriage on Jan. 25, 1884 via About.com:\n\nWashington, Jan. 24. Frederick Douglass, the colored leader, was married in this city this evening to Miss Helen M. Pitts, a white woman, formerly of Avon, New York. The wedding, which took place at the house of Dr. Grimké, of the Presbyterian church, was private, only two witnesses being present. The first wife of Mr. Douglass, who was a colored woman, died about a year ago. The woman he married today is about 35 years of age, and was employed as a copyist in his office. Mr. Douglass himself is about 73 years of age and has daughters as old as his present wife.\n\nBoth outspoken activists died after doing what they loved. Douglass died of a heart attack in 1895 on the same day he delivered a speech on women's suffrage, according to AFK Insider . Pitts died in 1903 after working on a women's rights publication called the Alpha , founding the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association and working to ensure Douglass' home would be preserved as a historical landmark, according to About.com .\n\nNo matter what obstacles these couples faced, their challenges and triumphs paved the way for millions after them, from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, the first American mayor married to a black wife to take office, to entertainers such as Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West , as well as millions of others marrying their love based on heart and character rather than their skin."

Here is a brief recap of the this landmark civil rights case.\n\nEarl Warren\n\nAs of 1967, 16 states had still not repealed anti-miscegenation laws that forbid interracial marriages. Mildred and Richard Loving were residents of one such state, Virginia. They had fallen in love and wanted to get married.\n\nUnder Virginia's laws, however, Richard, a white man, could not marry Mildred, a woman of African American and Native American descent. The two travelled to Washington D.C. where they could be married, but they were arrested under a Virginia state law that prohibited inter-racial marriage.\n\nLink : Read The Full Decision\n\nBecause their offense was a criminal conviction, after being found guilty, they were given a prison sentence of one year. The trial judge suspended the sentence for 25 years on the condition that the couple leave Virginia.\n\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia ruled that the state had an interest in preserving the \"racial integrity\" of its constituents and that because the punishment applied equally to both races, the statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, reversed the Virginia Court's ruling and held that the Equal Protection Clause required strict scrutiny to apply to all race based classifications. Furthermore, the Court concluded that the law was rooted in invidious racial discrimination, making it impossible to satisfy a compelling government interest.\n\n\"Under our Constitution,\" wrote Chief Justice Earl Warren, \"the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.\"\n\nThe Loving decision still stands as a milestone in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nMore Historical Stories From Constitution Daily\n\nOn This Day: James Madison introduces the Bill of Rights\n\n50 interesting facts about Abraham Lincoln's life\n\nExamining the legacy of Chief Justice Warren Burger"

Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said Tuesday that he believes interracial marriage should not be legal nationwide and that individual states should decide whether to allow it.\n\n\"So you would be OK with the Supreme Court leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states?\" reporter Dan Carden of The Times of Northwest Indiana asked Braun.\n\n\"Yes,\" the senator replied on the call with Indiana reporters. \"I think that's something ― if you're not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too. I think that's hypocritical.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court legalized interracial marriage nationwide in 1967, in the landmark case Loving v. Virginia.\n\nThe world Braun would return to is what same-sex couples faced until 2015 - their marriage was not recognized federally and might be legal in one state but not the next. That sort of discrimination had ramifications in all corners of life, including medical decisions and family planning.\n\nBraun later walked back his comments, claiming he misunderstood the question.\n\n\"Earlier during a virtual press conference I misunderstood a line of questioning that ended up being about interracial marriage, let me be clear on that issue - there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form, at all levels and by any states, entities, or individuals,\" he said in a statement provided to HuffPost.\n\nBraun's argument came on the second day of confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson. Braun is not on the judiciary committee, but he ultimately will get to vote on whether to confirm her. Jackson herself is in an interracial marriage.\n\nIn the call with reporters, Braun said he wants a justice who won't be an \"activist,\" and he cited Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion access, as an example of judicial activism. Striking it down, he said, would be \"bringing it back to a neutral point, to where that issue should never have been federalized.\"\n\nHe said the \"expression of individual states\" should be allowed to shine through.\n\n\"If you want that diversity to shine within our federal system, there are going to be rules and proceedings that are going to be out of synch maybe with what other states would do. That's the beauty of the system,\" he said of a world where people of different races would not be allowed to get married everywhere.\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.\n\nLindsey Graham Asks Ketanji Brown Jackson To Rate How Religious She Is\n\nBlack Women Rally At Supreme Court For Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nGOP Outraged By Ketanji Brown Jackson's Link To School Teaching Anti-Racism"

Virginia, Americans have increasingly dated and married across racial and ethnic lines. But many interracial couples say they still face racism and violence.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated June 13, 2017, 11:32 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nFifty years after Mildred and Richard Loving's landmark legal challenge shattered the laws against interracial marriage in the United States, some couples of different races still talk of facing discrimination, disapproval, and sometimes outright hostility from their fellow Americans.\n\nAlthough the racist laws against mixed marriages are gone, several interracial couples said in interviews they still get nasty looks, insults, and sometimes even violence when people find out about their relationships.\n\n\"I have not yet counseled an interracial wedding where someone didn't have a problem on the bride's or the groom's side,\" said the Rev. Kimberly D. Lucas of St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C.\n\nShe often counsels engaged interracial couples through the prism of her own 20-year marriage - Reverand Lucas is black and her husband, Mark Retherford, is white.\n\n\"I think for a lot of people it's OK if it's 'out there' and it's other people but when it comes home and it's something that forces them to confront their own internal demons and their own prejudices and assumptions, it's still really hard for people,\" she said.\n\nInterracial marriages became legal nationwide on June 12, 1967, after the Supreme Court threw out a Virginia law in that sent police into the Lovings' bedroom to arrest them just for being who they were: a married black woman and white man.\n\nThe Lovings were locked up and given a year in a Virginia prison, with the sentence suspended on the condition that they leave Virginia. Their sentence is memorialized on a marker to go up on Monday in Richmond, Va., in their honor.\n\nThe Supreme Court's unanimous decision in Loving v. Virginia struck down the Virginia law and similar statutes in roughly one-third of the states. Some of those laws went beyond black and white, prohibiting marriages between whites and Native Americans, Filipinos, Indians, Asians, and in some states \"all non-whites.\"\n\nThe Lovings, a working-class couple from a deeply rural community, weren't trying to change the world and were media-shy, said one of their lawyers, Philip Hirschkop, who now lives in Lorton, Va. They simply wanted to be married and raise their children in Virginia.\n\nBut when police raided their Central Point home in 1958 and found a pregnant Mildred in bed with her husband and a District of Columbia marriage certificate on the wall, they arrested them, leading the Lovings to plead guilty to cohabitating as man and wife in Virginia.\n\n\"Neither of them wanted to be involved in the lawsuit, or litigation or taking on a cause. They wanted to raise their children near their family where they were raised themselves,\" Mr. Hirschkop said.\n\nBut they knew what was at stake in their case.\n\n\"It's the principle. It's the law. I don't think it's right,\" Mildred Loving said in archival video footage shown in an HBO documentary.\n\n\"And if, if we do win, we will be helping a lot of people.\"\n\nRichard Loving died in 1975, Mildred Loving in 2008.\n\nSince the Loving decision, Americans have increasingly dated and married across racial and ethnic lines. Currently, 11 million people - or 1 out of 10 married people - in the United States have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of US Census Bureau data.\n\nIn 2015, 17 percent of newlyweds - or at least 1 in 6 of newly married people - were intermarried, which means they had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity. When the Supreme Court decided the Lovings' case, only 3 percent of newlyweds were intermarried.\n\nBut interracial couples can still face hostility from strangers and sometimes violence.\n\nIn the 1980s, Michele Farrell, who is white, was dating an African-American man and they decided to look around Port Huron, Mich., for an apartment together. \"I had the woman who was showing the apartment tell us, 'I don't rent to coloreds. I definitely don't rent to mixed couples,' \" Ms. Farrell said.\n\nIn March, a white man fatally stabbed a black man in New York City, telling the Daily News that he'd intended it as \"a practice run\" in a mission to deter interracial relationships. In August 2016 in Olympia, Wash., Daniel Rowe, who is white, walked up to an interracial couple without speaking, stabbed the black man in the abdomen and knifed his white girlfriend. Rowe's victims survived and he was arrested.\n\nAnd even after the Loving decision, some states tried their best to keep interracial couples from marrying.\n\nIn 1974, Joseph and Martha Rossignol got married at night in Natchez, Miss., on a Mississippi River bluff after local officials tried to stop them. But they found a willing priest and went ahead anyway.\n\n\"We were rejected everyplace we went, because no one wanted to sell us a marriage license,\" said Martha Rossignol, who has written a book about her experiences then and since as part of a biracial couple. She's black, he's white.\n\n\"We just ran into a lot of racism, a lot of issues, a lot of problems. You'd go into a restaurant, people wouldn't want to serve you. When you're walking down the street together, it was like you've got a contagious disease.\"\n\nBut their love survived, Ms. Rossignol said, and they returned to Natchez to renew their vows 40 years later.\n\nInterracial couples can now be seen in books, television shows, movies and commercials. Former President Barack Obama is the product of a mixed marriage, with a white American mother and an African father. Public acceptance is growing, said Kara and William Bundy, who have been married since 1994 and live in Bethesda, Md.\n\n\"To America's credit, from the time that we first got married to now, I've seen much less head-turns when we walk by, even in rural settings,\" said Mr. Bundy, who is black. \"We do go out for hikes every once in a while, and we don't see that as much any longer. It really is dependent on where you are in the country and also the locale.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In 1980 it was 6.7 percent.\n\nLoading...\n\nFeb. 16, 2012, 2:28 p.m. ET\n\nThe rate at which Americans marry someone of another race has more than doubled over the past three decades, a sign of increasing public acceptance of once-taboo relationships.\n\nAbout 15 percent of all new marriages in the United States in 2010 were between spouses of different race or ethnicity, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center . In 1980 the share was 6.7 percent. The Pew Center refers to marriages of mixed ethnicity in cases where Latinos and non-Latinos married.\n\nAlongside the growing numbers of such mixed marriages, American approval of family ties that cross racial and ethnic lines has been rising.\n\nThe Pew report draws on the center's own polling, as well as on Census records relating to marriage. In Pew's polling during the past three years, 63 percent of Americans say it \"would be fine\" with them if a member of their own family were to marry someone outside their own racial or ethnic group.\n\nIn 1986, the public was divided about this, with 28 percent saying interracial marriage was not acceptable for anyone, and an additional 37 percent saying it may be acceptable for others, but not for themselves. Only one-third of the public viewed interracial marriage as acceptable for everyone.\n\nToday, 35 percent of Americans say they have an immediate family member or close relative who is currently married to someone of a different race.\n\nAll this doesn't mean that race has become a meaningless concept for Americans.\n\nA USA Today / Gallup poll last year found, for instance, that 46 percent of Americans (including 44 percent of whites and 55 percent of blacks) agreed with the statement that relations between blacks and whites \"will always be a problem for the United States,\" while a majority of the public sided with the view that \"a solution will eventually be worked out.\"\n\nBut the weight race carries for social relations has clearly declined for individual Americans.\n\nIn Gallup polls asking \"do you approve or disapprove\" of marriage between blacks and whites, the results have shifted dramatically over the past half century.\n\nIn 1958, some 94 percent of Americans disapproved. (The phrasing of the question then was slightly different, referring to \"colored people.\") By last year, 86 percent said they approved, while 11 percent said they disapproved.\n\nInterracial unions remain a small share of marriages overall. Looking at all married couples in 2010, regardless of when they married, Pew found that intermarriages accounted for 8.4 percent of the total, up from just 3.2 percent in 1980.\n\nAmong all newlyweds in 2010, nine percent of whites, 17 percent of African-Americans, 26 percent of Hispanics, and 28 percent of Asian-Americans \"married out\" (outside their own race), the center reported in its study, released Thursday.\n\nEven as Americans feel freer to find a marriage partner without race as a barrier, the institution of marriage faces strains on other fronts, however.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The Lovings were sentenced to a year in prison, but they brought their case before the Supreme Court and their love won. In 1967 the justices ruled in their favor in Loving v. Virginia, thereby invalidating all race-based restrictions on marriage in the United States.\n\nThat same year, only 3 percent of newlyweds were interracial. But the interracial marriage rate in the US has increased almost every year since then. In 2015, as many as 17 percent of married couples were of different races, according to a recent Pew Research Center report .\n\nZhenchao Qian, a sociology professor at Brown University in Providence, R.I., and an expert on marriage patterns, says there are two components to this increase.\n\n\"One is that American society has become more diversified - there are more people of different racial groups in the US.... A lot of it is based on numbers,\" says Dr. Qian. \"But we also are more likely to see people of different racial groups today....

He and his wife would \"go into a store, we go into a restaurant, whatever, and the assumption of the people working there was that we weren't together. That would be a constant\" when they were dating in the early 1990s. \"It's fair to say we represent something that is changing in our society,\" he said.\n\nOne of the largest shifts reported by Pew is family acceptance. Sixty-three percent of Americans asked in 1990 said they opposed the idea of a close relative marrying a black person. By 2016 that had fallen to 14 percent.\n\n\"We learned quickly that we couldn't answer all of the questions that our families had,\" Barb Roose, a black woman who married her white husband in 1992, told The New York Times . \"[W]e decided not to let other people's issues with our marriage become our own.

As an infant, she hadn't fully grown into her \"color,\" but she didn't exactly look white, either. So people wondered what she was. Too often, I indulged the question, when all it deserved was the obvious answer.\n\n\"What is she?\"\n\n\"A baby.\"\n\nOn good days, I didn't let it bother me. On not-so-great days, I got annoyed. Here was this cute-as-can-be baby girl, and people were focused on the fact that we didn't match.\n\nAs she grew older and her skin naturally darkened, we looked more like the African American mother-daughter pair people expected, so the questions ceased.\n\nI flashed back on those early days when I saw the results of a recent Gallup Poll on interracial marriage . What was once perceived as an egregious mismatch is now widely accepted. Specifically, of the 1,007 adults across the United States polled by phone in July, 94% approve of marriages between Black people and white people. That's up from a mere 4% in 1958, when Gallup first asked the question. In 1968, a year after the Supreme Court legalized interracial marriage , 20% of Americans approved of the practice. By 1992, when my daughter was born, 48% approved.\n\nIn short, the country is catching up to what has always been true: Love bridges racial differences. That's true among friends, parents and children, husbands and wives.\n\nThis article appeared in the September 23, 2021 edition of the Monitor Daily.\n\nLess noise.

But it's been a long, slow road. As recently as 1991, the National Opinion Research Center found that 66 percent of white Americans polled opposed a close relative marrying a black man.\n\nMore recently, a national survey by The Washington Post, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, and Harvard University found 86 percent of black respondents said their families would welcome a white person. But only 55 percent of white families would respond in kind. Still, the Current Population Survey estimates that there are more than 450,000 black-white marriages today, compared with 51,000 in 1960.\n\nThe more open attitudes toward interracial marriages may have had a beginning with the miscegenation court case of Richard Loving and Mildred Jeter. In 1958, Mr. Loving, a tall bricklayer from Virginia, married the love of his life, Miss Jeter, in Washington, D.C. But this wasn't a typical relationship. He was white. She was black.\n\nMixed-race marriages were illegal in their home state of Virginia, just as they were in many states in the South. When they returned home, she was arrested. A 1922 anti-miscegenation law stated that if blacks and whites intermarried, punishment was one to five years in prison.\n\nIn 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in Loving v. Virginia that a ban on interracial marriage was unconstitutional. The law was overturned in Virginia and 15 other states (14 had already repealed similar laws). Still, a dozen states had the ban on interracial marriages on their books into the 1970s, though the laws were legally unenforceable.\n\nThe most recent was Alabama, which removed the law from its books last November.\n\n(c) Copyright 2001.

One mom in an interracial marriage realizes that she has set limits on herself, and pushes to break her own boundaries, starting in the kitchen.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Feb. 11, 2014, 9:15 p.m. ET\n\nLast week, I got out of my comfort zone by making a traditional Mexican dish called \" pollo en adobo .\" I did my research on YouTube , inherited some spices from my mother-in-law's capable hands, and assembled all the necessary ingredients.\n\nFinally, I had prepared a traditional Mexican meal for my husband after meeting him nearly five years ago.\n\nI must've watched the YouTube recipe video at least ten times, making sure I was doing every little step exactly right. As my timer ticked down for the last couple minutes that the chicken and sauce needed to simmer, I realized I was so nervous I was sweating.\n\nWhen the dish made it to the table, my husband lifted the spoon to his lips, took a sip, and smiled.\n\nI had never attempted to make authentic Mexican food before now because - as weird as it may sound - I'm white. As in, basic meat and potatoes culinary skills, turns lobster-red after a day at the beach (no matter how much sunscreen I put on), kind of white.\n\nI just figured that I couldn't possibly make real Mexican food without somehow screwing it up. I know, it's irrational, but that's how I felt.\n\nWhat inspired me to take a shot at it? Thinking about our daughter. I realized that if I was going to limit myself to only cooking typical American dishes I was most familiar with, I would be setting a bad example for her. I want her to feel infinitely capable of making any kind of food she wants from both sides of her family.\n\nHaving the opportunity to deeply explore another culture's gastronomy is one of the best perks of my interracial marriage. It's surprising to think that just two or three generations ago, interracial marriage was illegal in some states, until the 1967 Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia nullified all laws prohibiting it.\n\nNow, interracial marriage is becoming more and more common in the United States . A study published in 2012 found that 8.4 percent of all marriages in the US are interracial, making that about 1 in every 12 couples, up from only 3.2 precent in 1980.\n\nBut still, interracial marriage remains a controversial issue. Just last May, there was intense backlash on YouTube and other websites when Cheerios aired its commercial featuring a family that had a white mom and black dad. The follow-up ad depicting the same family ran during the Super Bowl, and also prompted many racist comments on Twitter and other social media platforms.\n\nA recent Huffington Post article titled \"Why I Can't Be My Son's Mother\" shared actress mom Shannon Shelton Miller's struggles with never being cast in commercials as the mom of her son, since he has whiter skin that she does.\n\nAccording to Ms. Shelton Miller, \"Corporations will happily cast a rainbow of Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, and African-American actors for their commercials in the name of diversity, but they're rarely cast together. I seethed last year when I read one casting call for a major retailer requesting \"real\" Caucasian and African-American families, and then, in capital letters in the next sentence: 'NO MIXED FAMILIES.' \"\n\nWhile America has come a long way in embracing a diverse range of skin tones, there's still a pronounced stigma against mixed families.\n\nI've experienced both ends of the spectrum. My mixed family has been stared at many times, waiters have asked if we wanted separate checks, and airline ticket counter attendants have told me to go wait my turn when I approach the counter with my husband, not realizing that we're together.\n\nWe've also been treated with a level of normalcy that is refreshing, especially among our peers. A friend over for dinner recently remarked, \"Babies from mixed parents are so beautiful and well-behaved. I think having to balance two cultures makes them more flexible, too.\"\n\nBalancing two cultures helps kids realize that they can't be smushed into a limited box, and neither can anyone else - we all have a diverse background and range of experiences that shape who we are.\n\nWe are all better off when there's more diversity in society, which includes interracial marriages. As it gets more difficult to answer the question \"What's your background?\" we become more alike because we realize we are all from mixed backgrounds.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Most importantly, she will be able to state that she is from the United States of America.\n\nLike Coca-Cola's Super Bowl ad titled \" It's Beautiful \" pointed out, America is beautiful largely because of its diversity. And not diversity that can be organized into neat little boxes, but diversity that includes diversity within it, constantly challenging what assumptions we come to adopt. When those assumptions are left behind, compassion begins.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

He even lets black people use his bathroom, he said.\n\nSure, the underlying tenets of humor about the South has a bit to do with the insecurity of the North facing a virile Sunbelt economy that, up until recently, had a major influence on national and presidential politics.\n\nBut the political defeat of the Southern-based Republican party has given a little more leeway to poke fun at the South. Of course, that task is only made easier by the fact that some Southerners can't help but step in it again and again.\n\nThe pace has only picked up after the election of President Barack Obama , whose skin color has revealed a usually hidden strain of racism that remains present in the South. (Regionalism, if not racism, seems mutual: Besides White House press secretary Robert Gibbs , an Alabamian, real down-home Southerners are a rarity in the Obama inner circle.)\n\nThis week we had the Louisiana judge who somehow had missed the last 30 years -- the US Supreme Court outlawed bans on interracial marriages in 1967 -- and refused to marry an interracial couple.\n\n\"There is a problem with both groups accepting a child from such a marriage,\" Mr. Bardwell said. \"I think those children suffer, and I won't help put them through it.\"\n\nThere was Congressman Joe Wilson 's \"You Lie\" outburst to President Obama. Judging by his fundraising since, Wilson's been hailed as a hero even though his comment embarrassed many in South Carolina.\n\nEarlier this year, Rusty DePass , a Republican activist, said a gorilla that escaped from the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, S.C. , was an ancestor of Michelle Obama .\n\nThe state may pay a steep price for a few local chuckles in such cases, warns Brian Hicks , a columnist for the Post and Courier in Charleston . He writes:\n\nOkay, it's always fun to kick the South and its sympathizers around when they're down. (See: Reconstruction). But sometimes, even people here in the South agree, the criticism is more than warranted.\n\nThe darker side, says Truthout's Michael Hittleman , is that recent pratfalls in the South hint that \"the Republican's 1968 'Southern strategy' has morphed into the Southern Democratic Party 's 1860 strategy ... reminiscent of the antebellum South.\"\n\nOf course, to a majority in the South, that's not funny -- and neither is Mr. Bardwell's refusal to marry the couple. Many of the 77 percent of Americans who support interracial marriage, according to Gallup, live in the South.\n\nRealizing that Southerners playing into the hands of late-night monologists can be politically damaging to a party trying to be more diverse and inclusive, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and other state officials have criticized Bardwell for his beliefs, and have called for his resignation.\n\n-----\n\nFollow us on Twitter .\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "The Future Of The Multi-Cultural, Biracial, And Multiracial Landscape\n\nBy Earl Carr\n\nBy Earl Carr ,\n\nContributor.\n\nMulti Racial Hands\n\nUpdated, Aug. 13, 2024: This post has been adjusted to correct the title of George Mason Professor Justin Gest.\n\nIn an era defined by unprecedented migration trends coupled with globalization and interconnectedness, the fabric of society is increasingly woven with threads of diversity. From bustling metropolises to remote villages, the world is witnessing a remarkable convergence of cultures, ethnicities, and races. This convergence has given rise to a rich tapestry of multicultural, biracial, and multiracial trends that are reshaping societal norms, identities, advertising, and challenging traditional boundaries . From Athletes that look like Naomi Osaka and others participating in the Olympics, to the realm of politics; Donald Trump told journalists on Wednesday that his presidential opponent Kamala Harris \"turned Black\" for political gain, multi-cultural, race, and identity are impacting our society.\n\nThe 21st century is witnessing a seismic shift in demographics, with migration, globalization, and technological advancements serving as catalysts for the intermingling of cultures and races. Multiracial children represent one of the most rapidly expanding segments of the U.S. population , reflecting a profound shift in the nation's demographics. Over the last decade, there has been a 276% increase in the population of multiracial people in the United States . This surge is propelled by the growing prevalence of interracial marriages and relationships, alongside a rise in transracial and international adoptions. Nowhere is this more evident than in urban centers, where the confluence of cultures creates vibrant \" melting pots \" or \" salad bowls \" of diversity.\n\nCities like New York, London, and Tokyo have long been celebrated for their cultural kaleidoscope, where individuals of different ethnicities and backgrounds coexist and thrive. Looking at the U.S. specifically, Justin Gest, a professor specializing in politics and government at George Mason University's School of Politics and Government, highlighted California's prominence as the top state for interracial and intercultural marriages in the United States. He described California as a \"pioneer\" state due to its early actions in repealing anti-miscegenation laws in the 1950s, preceding the landmark Loving v. Virginia ruling that struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriages.\n\nSimilar mixed-race population trends are seen in the U.K. The 2021 Census revealed a significant 40% increase in the number of people identifying as 'mixed/multiple ethnic groups' since 2011. This growth is accompanied by increasing diversity within the mixed-race population, with various combinations of ethnic backgrounds represented. This has several important implications. First, migration and the development of new diverse communities create new entrepreneurial ecosystems in goods, products, and services such as food, travel, books , and hair products to name a few. These all create positive externalities for new businesses. While London has emerged as the primary center for mixed-race populations in the U.K., significant mixed-race populations are also found outside the city. As the world becomes more diverse, documenting and sharing mixed-race history across the globe is crucial, calling for greater representation and recognition of mixed-race experiences in public discourse. More importantly, this can create space for communities to gain a greater sense of cultural competence, tolerance, and greater acceptance to become better global citizens.\n\nXuhrat left Western China and immigrated to Japan in his twenty's. He has now lived in Japan for ... More almost 25 years, and his wife and three kids have immersed themselves in Japanese culture while trying to retain their Uygur identity has been difficult. I had an opportunity to live with them for almost a week.\n\nOne of the most profound manifestations of this global trend is the rise of biracial and multiracial individuals who straddle multiple cultural and ethnic identities. In the past, such individuals often faced challenges in reconciling their dual heritage, grappling with questions of belonging and identity. Other cultural issues may stem from feeling the need to choose to belong to a certain cultural group over another based on the existing majority group.\n\nOn a Sunday in Taichung, Taiwan, my family and I were crammed into a mall elevator when a six-year-old boy pointed at my nephew Quisan, who is Black, and exclaimed, \"外国人\", or \"foreigner\" in Chinese. Although the boy clearly meant no harm, his comment had inadvertently revealed to us society's deeper struggle to adapt to the increased presence of multicultural families within Taiwan, as well as the rest of the world.\n\nSonia Smith Kang, the visionary behind Mixed Up Clothing , hails from a diverse background with an African-American father and Mexican-American mother and shares insights into her journey of multiracial identity . Growing up, she recalls grappling with a sense of otherness, realizing early on that her physical appearance and language set her apart in her predominantly white community. \"Entering school, I felt the difference immediately. Being my first time speaking English and residing in a predominantly white area, I could sense the uniqueness of our family,\" reminisces Richard Kang, Sonia's husband and a first-generation Korean-American.\n\nNavigating their interracial marriage brought its own set of challenges. While Sonia's parents welcomed Richard with open arms, the adjustment was more nuanced for Richard's parents. \"I was determined to marry Sonia, irrespective of my parents' reservations,\" Kang reflects, echoing a sentiment shared by many in similar situations.\n\nTheir children, raised in a multicultural environment, proudly identify as multiracial, honoring the diverse heritage of both parents. The Kangs have made a concerted effort to instill in their children an appreciation for each culture, utilizing literature and films that mirror their family's background. While they strive to create a nurturing environment at home, Sonia acknowledges the hurdles her children face outside their doorstep.\n\nThe Kangs' story resonates with countless families navigating the complexities of multiracial identity. As they continue to embrace their unique cultural tapestry, their journey serves as a beacon of resilience and unity in an increasingly divisive and diverse world.\n\nIn today's increasingly inclusive society, there is a growing recognition and celebration of diverse identities. Biracial and multiracial individuals are embracing their heritage, forging unique identities that draw from multiple cultural influences.\n\nSimilarly, raised as a Chewish (half Chinese, half Polish/Russian Jew) boy in a predominately Gentile neighborhood, Jason Kingdon, I learned how to embrace his multiethnic identity by coming into myself. Jason notes this entailed being cognizant of where he defined himself antithetically against those around him and where he forewent idiosyncrasy to amalgamate. He also needed to understand how he was nurtured. To framework the way his parents raised him, he actively sought out his immediate family's war-torn legacy and how it shaped our traditions that kept cultural norms alive. This is how Jason learned to build his base of self by understanding his exogenous influences and internal drivers.\n\n\"For me, in short, it was about taking the time to learn about both cultures, encouraging exploration, and respecting their unique blend.\" -Jason M. Kingdon\n\nBlack, biracial, and multiracial individuals from Guyana, America, Jamaica, Panama, and Taiwan. From ...

There are two white kids who he clearly says not to but there is another friend who looks mixed and so Dre as he looks at the mixed kid says, \"I need to see your Mama.\" The point here is increasingly diverse communities are redefining identities so that there is no one monolithic notion of Black, Brown, and the list goes on, Black comes in many different shades, colors, shapes and sizes and no one can define your black identity. I remind my children (Francis and Mia) who are both black and Asian about this often.\n\nFlotemp is an American company that produces beds, chairs and other products in Taiwan. This ...

More young Asian girl holding up a ping-pong ball as part of an Apple and Verizon campaign.\n\nTelevision shows , movies, and advertisements now feature a more diverse array of faces and stories, reflecting the multicultural reality of our world (Figure 1). This increased visibility not only validates the experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds but also helps to break down stereotypes and foster greater understanding and empathy across communities.\n\nFigure 1: Public opinion on whether TV shows should have more characters that represent interracial ... More couples in the United States as of March 2018, by age;\n\nDespite the progress made in embracing diversity, challenges persist. Discrimination, prejudice, and systemic inequalities continue to hinder the full inclusion and acceptance of individuals from diverse backgrounds. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from  governments, educators, institutions, and civil society to promote equality and social justice for all. An important first step is for educators to promote more diverse story-reading books in curriculums starting in elementary school but continuing through middle and high school. More importantly, to mandate study abroad at the undergraduate level would be an invaluable experience for all students, as some universities are finding.\n\nNevertheless, the trajectory is promising. As years pass, the world becomes more interconnected, and the boundaries that once divided us continue to blur. In this evolving landscape, diversity is not merely a buzzword but a fundamental aspect of our shared humanity. From Crayola's Colors of the World campaign to Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse , brands are harnessing the power and importance of multicultural trends sweeping across the globe, reshaping the way we perceive identity, community, and belonging. As we celebrate diversity in all its forms, we must also recognize the importance of fostering inclusivity and understanding. By embracing our differences and celebrating our shared humanity, we can build a more equitable, tolerant, and culturally competent world for future generations to inherit.\n\nSpecial thanks to Lorena James for contributing research, editorial edits, and pictures for this article.

More prohibited interracial marriages.\n\nAccording to Gallup, which has been surveying American's views on interracial marriage for more than six decades, the previous high was an 87% approval rate in 2013.\n\nWhen Gallup first asked the question, in 1958, just 4% approved and 94% disapproved.\n\nIn previous decades, there were significant regional and generational differences of opinion.\n\nAs recently as 1991, only 33% of adults in the South approved of interracial marriage; that number stood at 93% in Thursday's poll.\n\nSimilarly, only 27% of Americans over the age of 50 supported interracial marriage in 1991 - now more than 90% do.\n\nThe poll was conducted from July 6-21 among 1,007 adults in all 50 states.\n\nIn 1958, the same year Gallup first queried Americans on their beliefs regarding interracial marriage, Mildred Jeter, a Black woman, exchanged wedding vows with Richard Loving, a white man, in Washington, D.C., where interracial marriage was legal. However, when the couple returned home to Caroline County, Virginia, they were charged with unlawfully \"cohabiting as man and wife, against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth,\" as interracial marriage was deemed in violation of Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924. The Lovings were charged with a felony, found guilty, and sentenced to a year in jail. The couple initially appealed their conviction to the Supreme Court of Virginia, but the state's ruling was upheld. They then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear their case. In June of 1967, in a unanimous decision , the Court decided in the Lovings favor, overturning their convictions. It ruled that the antiquated Virginia statutes had no legitimate purpose \"independent of invidious racial discrimination .\" Loving v. Virginia not only struck down Virginia's anti-miscegenation law but also ended all race-based legal restrictions on marriage in the U.S. In the summer of 1967, a total of 16 states had not yet repealed anti-miscegenation laws prohibiting interracial marriages.\n\n\"Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State,\" wrote Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1967.\n\nAn international Gallup poll taken in 1968 found that opposition to interracial marriage was far greater in the U.S than in other nations. More than 70% of Americans disapproved of white-nonwhite marriages, in contrast with only 25% of residents in France , 23% in the Netherlands, and 21% of residents in Sweden. Approval of interracial marriage didn't reach a majority level in the U.S. until 1997.\n\nU.S. Approval of Interracial Marriage at New High of 94% (Gallup)\n\nA Record Number Of Americans, Including Republicans, Now Support Same-Sex Marriage (NPR)"

      "text": "National Loving Day: Growing Up Multiracial In America\n\nBy Holly Corbett\n\nBy Holly Corbett ,\n\nContributor.\n\nBeing multiracial in America.\n\nNational Loving Day happens on June 12, and is the anniversary of the historic 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision Loving vs. Virginia. In 1958, Mildred and Richard Loving were arrested for being married because they were an interracial couple living in Viriginia. Their case made it all the way to the Supreme Court and, nine years after their arrest, they won, striking down all state laws against interracial marriage in the United States.\n\nLet's put this in perspective: Only 54 years ago, it was illegal for one person to marry another person if they were of a different race in 17 States across America . Today multiracial Americans are growing at a rate of three times faster than the population as a whole, according to the Pew Research Center .\n\nI spoke to some multiracial Americans on their experiences of growing up \"mixed,\" and their hopes for the next generation. This is a snapshot of personal stories, and, while not representative of all people of mixed race backgrounds as everyone's story is unique, is a collection of first-person accounts of growing up multiracial in America. Here are their stories.\n\n*These interviews have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nJennifer Kohl , Executive Director Integrated Media, VMLY&R\n\n\"In the Asian culture when you're half Asian, you're called 'Hapa,' which is Hawaiian for 'half or part.' In 2021, I could not be prouder to be mixed, to be Chinese, to be German. I love the fact that I have an interesting mix of races and cultures within me. But growing up, I would have to admit, it was hard. I realized I had buried a lot of those memories somewhere because they were painful. The truth is my parents had a mixed-race marriage that was not common for their time nor widely accepted.\n\nJennifer Kohl's father, who is German, and Mother, who is Chinese.\n\nThey were stared at. The feeling when I showed up with my German dad to an event was different than when I showed up with my Chinese mom. Sometimes people were surprised, because my last name is German.\n\nI remember being called a 'chink' and being made fun of for being different. I'm a Gen-Xer, and growing up, there wasn't as much awareness around bullying and racial slurs. I never denied being Chinese, but I definitely remember sometimes feeling as though I should hide it. It's a sad thing to admit as an adult: I don't think it was embarrassment, but probably more about wanting to fit in. Being half white was easier, but the truth was that everyone knew I was something . Even now, sometimes if my hair is really curly or if I wear red lipstick or if I'm really tan, I get different comments. People ask if I'm Hawaiian, Eskimo, Mexican, Greek.\n\nI think prior to 2020, I was living with my head down, working hard and still trying to blend in. Culturally, Asians are known for being hard workers, and not wanting to cause any trouble, which is also partially an immigrant mentality. We're not loud or very vocal by nature.\n\nToday in 2021, my head is held much higher, my back is much straighter. I'm more open about my minority half to help make things better for me and for my kids. We're seeing a lot of Asians defend the community and fight to stop Asian hate from happening, because the conversation has been really hard this past year. I certainly want some bigger action in terms of preventing it and creating more awareness and education.\n\nI have so much hope for our Gen-Z children. They're much more inclusive in the way they talk. Their radar is up way quicker than mine ever was to say, 'Hey, you can't say that-that doesn't sound right.' I have way more conversations with my children about race, equality, and inclusion; certainly more conversations than my immigrant parents ever did with me as they tried to \"not rock the boat.\"  The boat is moving a little bit more; not necessarily rocking too hard, but it's rocking enough that it feels like there's some progress. I think it's so important to keep having conversations with our kids and people in our networks in order to move forward.\"\n\nMandy Bynum McLaughlin, CEO & Co-Founder, The Race Equ(al)ity Project\n\n\"I was born in the D.C. area, in Rockville, Maryland specifically. When I was seven years old, my family moved from Maryland to North Carolina. When we moved, I noticed the difference almost right away. We lived in a bigger house in a neighborhood that was one hundred percent white.\n\nThat was the first time I heard the N-word said to me.  Most of the other Black kids lived in a completely different part of town, leaving my only Black friends being those I met at school. I think my parents had a much tougher time as well. My mom is from Syracuse and, although she didn't grow up around many Black people, racism wasn't quite as prevalent as it was in North Carolina. I think my Dad faced a lot more racism than he did in D.C. The hardest part for me personally was feeling like I didn't fit in, and having privilege at the same time.\n\nI knew from a very early age that there was something different about me. It took me a while to get the language. My Black cousins would visit from D.C. and ask me why I acted like a white girl. My friends at school, who were white, would say things like, 'I don't think of you as Black.' While I didn't have the language, I had all the feelings of frustration, anger, and wanting to be someone I wasn't.  Despite the tribulations of my childhood, the way I pay attention and empathize with people today is a direct result of knowing acutely what exclusion feels like.\n\nWe need to see people for everything they are. When we meet people, our first instinct is to identify them and put them into a box. A person's racial identity is just one of many different parts of them. Whiteness and white supremacy culture tell us that to be white means to hold all the power, hold all the knowledge. It's important to unlearn a lot of it and recognize experiences that are blended.\n\nI love meeting other biracial people, because I feel they get the richness of our blended experience, and understand how we often feel like we have to choose one or the other [racial identity]. They know what it feels like when you can't always be all of yourself.\"\n\nDavid Ryan Barcega Castro-Harris, Founder, Amplify RJ\n\n\"I am African Filipino American. I'm the descendant of people from West Africa who were forced onto boats and brought to the land we now call the United States as property before any of us can remember. I am also the descendant of people who came here in the 1970s from the Philippines. My ethnicity is a large part of who I am, but other factors shape me. My father grew up in a Black community in Columbia, Maryland, just outside of D.C. My mom grew up all over because her father was in the U.S. Navy. They both came to Southern California for college and they've been here ever since.\n\nDavid Ryan Barcega Castro-Harris with his wife, father, mother and brother on his wedding day.\n\nSouthern California can be called a melting pot as it's fairly racially diverse, so it's a very different environment then the communities that they were born in. Growing up mixed meant I was around my Filipino American family a lot more because my mom's family was physically closer to us than my dad's family, who were still on the East coast. No Black experience or no Filipino American experience is monolithic. But because we lived in the suburbs and I went to a private school, I was not around a lot of Black people.\n\nMy dad tells this story. I don't remember it. I was three years old, and he took me to a Tumble Tots, this gymnastics place for kids. I did not want to go because there was nobody in the class who looked like me. I was able to recognize this as a three-year old. I don't remember if the kids were all white, or just other races, but it's tough knowing you don't necessarily feel a sense of belonging in a racial group.\n\nMixed race people have to see both sides or multiple views of any situation, because that's just in our nature. I don't think being mixed raced is the entire reason that I'm doing restorative justice work. But when I think about doing restorative justice, a part of it is acknowledging that there are multiple truths and multiple perspectives to any story. That's in my body. Of course, it's in everybody's body, but in my lived experience, the way that I look, who my parents are, who my extended family is, forces me to see that.\"\n\nWillow Hill, Chief Creative Officer & Co-Founder, Scout Lab\n\n\"I'm a mixed-race, Native American female founder. I grew up primarily in Arizona, on the border of a Native American reservation. Growing up, I experienced a lot of internalized racism just through the experience of being mixed race in a place where so many of the kids around me were either white or Native American.\n\nWhen my teachers found out that I was part Native American, they held me back from recess, thinking maybe I wasn't as up-to-speed academically as the other students because of my heritage. I also experienced teasing and bullying from other kids because of both my heritage and my name. At some point around the second grade, I internalized that racism and started telling kids I was Hawaiian, which wasn't true. I learned about Hawaii in school and thought it might be a safe place to take refuge in. I hoped that saying I was Hawaiian and not Native American would help me avoid the pain and shaming I was experiencing from others. Unfortunately, I was correct. When I started lying the bullying subsided, which reinforced that my own identity did not feel like a safe place.\n\nAt age 13, my family moved to an area near Portland, Oregon. It was at that point I experienced a lot of different types of racism. People thought I was Asian American or Hispanic and made racial comments. Being someone who is mixed race, depending on where you are and what scenario you're in, it can be hard for people to place you. In that experience, I learned very quickly that wherever I was had an impact on what people perceived that I was. As a young person, I was asked 'What are you?' or' what kind of Asian are you?' so often that I never even second-guessed or considered how problematic this question was. I did not recognize until adulthood that the act of asking someone 'what' they are is objectifying.\n\nIt took experiencing this wide range of racism directed toward a lot of different groups for me to recognize that that's what my experience was, racism. As a child, it was easy for me to internalize these narratives and think that I was the problem, rather than connect it to a larger systemic issue.\n\nBeing biracial in America is a complex experience. As a young person, sometimes it can be hard to see a place where you fit in or find a place where you experience a sense of belonging.\n\nThis experience has given me the unique opportunity to turn something that once felt painful for me into empathy for others. When people ask 'what are you?,' the answer is first and foremost, 'a human.' That is what is at the center of everything. It's important to understand that whatever that thing is that feels the hardest is actually something powerful about you. Your uniqueness is your gift and your voice is your power. Finding that sense of belonging starts with self-acceptance, and then you have the ability to offer that sense of belonging to others. And that is a truly beautiful thing.\""

      "text": "Interracial Marriage: Changing Laws, Minds And Hearts\n\nBy Karlyn Bowman\n\nBy Karlyn Bowman ,\n\nContributor.\n\nPexels.com\n\nIn his farewell address to the nation, Barack Obama discussed race relations, noting that \"race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\" He acknowledged that race relations are better than they were years ago, but he added that all of us have more work to do. \"The laws alone won't be enough. Hearts must change.\"\n\nAlthough there is still much room for improvement, change in attitudes over time in polls about race underscore the President's optimism. The evolution of public opinion on interracial marriage is particularly relevant since this year marks the 50 th anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in the landmark case Loving v. Virginia (1967). The timely release of the new movie Loving , starring Ruth Negga and Joel Edgerton, demonstrates how far our nation and public opinion have come on race relations and on interracial marriage specifically.\n\nThere are few questions in the polls about the 1967 Loving decision that invalidated laws on interracial marriage, but there are many more general questions about race relations and interracial marriage from the time. In 1963, 59% of whites favored laws against interracial marriage. In 1968, 53%  did. By the summer of 1970, a majority said such laws should not exist, and a majority has given that response ever since. In the latest question from the National Opinion Research Center, 89% of whites opposed such laws. A majority nationally in a 2015 poll by the Pew Research Center said more people marrying someone of a different race doesn't make much difference for society; only a handful (11%) said this is a change for the worse.\n\nAlthough opinion, including those of whites, moved to agreement with the Court's ruling to eliminate discriminatory laws, actual support for the idea of interracial marriage lagged. Three-quarters of whites in 1968 and almost as many Americans overall (73%) disapproved of the idea of marriages between blacks and whites. The last time Gallup asked the question in 2013, 11% nationally gave that response. In the polls, blacks have always been more supportive than whites of interracial marriage, but the responses of both groups have moved in a more supportive direction in tandem. In Gallup's 2013 survey, 96% of blacks and 84% of whites approved of interracial marriage.\n\nThe Court's decision on interracial marriage dovetails with another golden anniversary this year, the 1967 release of the film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner . The movie, starring Sidney Poitier as a widowed African-American physician and Katharine Houghton as his white fiancée, recounts the couple's visit to her parents to announce their engagement. Houghton's father, played by Spencer Tracy, objected more than her mother, Katharine Hepburn, as did their African-American housekeeper. Filming ended just weeks before the Supreme Court's Loving decision.\n\nOpinions about interracial dating and marriage on a personal level have also evolved significantly. In 1971, 48% nationally said they would not approve of their own children dating someone of another race, while 28% said they would approve. In 2014, nearly eight in 10 Americans said it wouldn't matter at all if someone in their family was going to marry someone of another race. Nine percent said they would be happy about it, while 11% said they would be unhappy. Today, a majority of whites (54%) say they would neither favor nor oppose a close relative marrying a black person. Blacks are slightly less ambivalent, with 42% of them giving that response about a close relative marrying a white person. Fifty-two percent favor the idea compared to 30% of whites.\n\nAlong with these changes in public opinion, interracial marriage is also becoming more common in the United States. Pew Research Center analysis of the 2013 American Community Survey found that 6.3% of all marriages that year were between people of different races, compared to less than 1% in 1970.\n\nAs the President said in his farewell speech, race relations in the U.S. are still problematic. A Pew Research Center poll released in the fall found that only 9% thought race relations had gotten better since Obama came into office. Sixty-seven percent thought they had gotten worse. Even so, the journey of public opinion on interracial marriage, with landmarks of its own to celebrate this year, should give us cause for optimism. Just as laws can change, minds and hearts can, too.\n\nFor a complete assessment of public opinion on interracial marriage over time, read the January 2017 issue of AEI Political Report ."

      "text": "The Minority-Majority Shift. Two Decades That Will Change America. The Surge Of Multiracial Families\n\nBy Isaac Mizrahi\n\nBy Isaac Mizrahi ,\n\nContributor.\n\n2020 is the year when the majority of all Americans under seventeen years old will be from a minority background, a process that will culminate with a so-called \"minority-majority\" population by the mid-2040s. These demographic changes will bring about a significant transformation to Corporate America, and during the next few months, I will discuss some of these consequences, in each article targeting one specific area of our business environment.\n\ngetty\n\nIt is well known that over the past few decades America's population growth has been fueled by minority segments. Still, one less discussed consequence of this demographic change is the growth of multiracial households. While there's not enough quantitative research on this, a Census report from 2018 has shed some light on this trend, and the numbers are impressive.\n\nAccording to this report, the number of interracial couples in the U.S. grew from approximately 7% in 2000 to at least 10% in 2016, the most recent year for this data.\n\nA variation of the 3-percentage points in 16 years may not seem like much, but when we see analyze the data from an absolute standpoint, one can assess its magnitude. In 2000, these multiracial/multiethnic couples were estimated at approximately 4 million, and in 2016, this number was almost 6 million, a 50% increase, and we believe this trend will only accelerate in years to come.\n\nAccording to the report, the vast majority of the biracial couples were between non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and Hispanics, followed by 14% of NHW and Asian Americans, 8% between NHW and African Americans, and 8% and other NHW individuals besides Hispanics. But looking beyond numbers, one of the crucial aspects of this trend is understanding how these biracial families retain both cultural backgrounds while still navigating the mainstream Anglo culture.\n\nTo get some guidance, I reached out to David Morse, author, speaker, and CEO of the New American Dimension, a research company that studies topics like this one. Moreover, David also lives in a biracial household and has firsthand experience on the subject.\n\nIsaac Mizrahi: What can we all learn as a society from a biracial household?\n\nDavid Morse: It's impossible to be \"colorblind\" when you live in a biracial household, as the realities of race in America are such that when one is non-white, there is never the privilege of not thinking about race. For family members who look non-white, race is part of their everyday reality, and many suffer the same macro and microaggressions as their non-mixed, non-white counterparts. Other family members who might look \"racially ambiguous\" are continually being asked by others what race they are, which so many find to be a constant annoyance. Finally, for whites like me, living in a mixed-race family, we get an opportunity to see up close what it is like to be a non-white person in America, though we still benefit from our white privilege when we are out and about.\n\nMizrahi: From a business/marketing perspective, is a biracial household the same as one that is not?\n\nMorse: We've done much research with biracial Americans, particularly younger ones. We've found that so many embrace multiple identities, often identifying with both parents' ethnicities. On the other hand, parents, though tending to be more culturally and racially empathetic than those in single race relationships, also grew up as being one race or another, and often possess much of the mindset that they grew up with.\n\nIn other words, each family member will be different, and for children, how they respond to an ad may reflect their physical appearance and how that child is treated by society. For instance, my children are half Asian Indian. One daughter is light and looks a lot like me. My other daughter is relatively dark, with Indian features. They get treated differently. Their young friends often ask how they can be \"two different races.\" Not only are biracial households different - but also each member of a biracial family usually has unique challenges.\n\nMizrahi: How hard is it for parents of a biracial household to raise their kids to learn about their multicultural heritage background?\n\nMorse: It can be challenging in a society that espouses \"color blindness\" and where race is often a taboo subject. But having discussions about race is very important, mainly when the children are male and might look Black or Hispanic. They need to be taught about racism, and particularly, to always be overtly cooperative with police officers, keeping their hands visible. They need to learn that they matter, though certain people might look down on them or hold lower expectations. And it's important to instill in all biracial children a sense of being proud of who they are and proud of their ancestors. It can be tough, particularly in a Black/white household where the children might look Black. However, one parent may be white and directly unfamiliar with how to navigate American racism safely.\n\nMizrahi: Is multiculturalism good for the country? Why?\n\nMorse: I sure think so. Whereas race mixing has been common in some societies, for instance, in many Latin American countries, anti-miscegenation (race mixing) laws and hypodescent rules (one drop of blood makes you Black, and a slave) were the norms in the United States. Multiracialism helps us get over a racist past and our aversion to even talking about race.\n\nMulticulturalism will strengthen us as a country. The division is what makes us weak, and in the United States, race has been THE top divider. On the contrary, diversity and bringing different perspectives and experiences to the table will make us truly great. As the United States becomes increasingly multicultural, we need to become equally as multifaceted in our worldview in terms of its demographics.\n\nIn terms of multiracial families, interracial marriage is often used by sociologists as a measure of social distance. In other words, the more interracial marriage is, the more it can be said that racial barriers are diminishing. However, we have a long way to go. Interracial marriage, though high between Hispanics and NHW and Asians with NHW, is relatively low between whites and Blacks, due to white racism and pressure within the Black community to marry other Blacks. If we are to be truly multicultural, the lines between Black and white need to diminish.\n\nAs the country moves toward a minority-majority society, we expect further growth in multiracial families, which will increase the need for advertisers to understand that a one-size-fits-all message strategy won't be as effective as it used to be in the '60s, '70s, and '80s. Developing in-depth knowledge when approaching the several racial and ethnic nuances in America will be an essential skillset for marketers, now and in the years to come, since truly connecting with multiracial families may hold the key to unlock future business growth."

Alison is a senior news reporter covering US politics and legal news.\n\nBy Alison Durkee ,\n\nForbes Staff.\n\nHouse lawmakers introduced legislation Monday that would enshrine some protections for same-sex marriage and interracial marriage in federal law-which they plan to vote on later this week-as marriage equality faces new threats.\n\nSame-sex marriage supporter Vin Testa waves a LGBTQ pride flag near the Supreme Court on April 28, ... More 2015 in Washington, DC.\n\nHouse Democrats introduced the Respect for Marriage Act , which repeals the Defense of Marriage Act that allowed states not to recognize same-sex marriages before the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.\n\nThe legislation was introduced in light of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, which raised the possibility it could overturn its ruling on same-sex marriage next.\n\nThe bill requires states to recognize marriages that took place legally in other states or jurisdictions regardless of \"sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.\"\n\nThat means states can't declare same-sex marriages or interracial marriages invalid even if they're outlawed in that state, as long as the marriage took place legally in the state where it was performed.\n\nThe bill also protects marriage equality under federal law by saying any federal laws that involve someone's marital status recognize the marriage as valid as long as it was legal in the state or territory where it was performed.\n\nIf the Supreme Court does overturn same-sex marriage, marriages that took place while it was still legal would be protected, as the bill states that the validity of a marriage is based only on what the laws were at the time the marriage took place and so can't be nullified retroactively.\n\nThe House will vote on the Respect for Marriage Act this week, House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Monday, and Punchbowl News reports a vote could take place as soon as Tuesday. It's unclear how the bill will fare in the Senate, however, where it would need support from at least 10 Republican lawmakers to pass. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has sponsored the bill in the Senate-calling it \"another step to promote equality, prevent discrimination, and protect the rights of all Americans\"-but it's unclear if any other Republicans will throw their support behind it.\n\nThe House will also vote this week on legislation that protects access to contraception, Hoyer said on Friday, which has similarly come under threat in light of the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\n\"During Pride Month, Justice [Clarence] Thomas announced to the world his crusade to overturn the privacy, intimacy, and marriage equality of the LGBTQ community,\" Rep. Ritchie Torres (NY-15), who co-chairs the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, said in a statement Monday. \"As we continue to see attacks on fundamental rights from the Court, it is clearer than ever that we must use every tool at our disposal to protect marriage equality.\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) suggested on Saturday that the Supreme Court should overturn its precedent on same-sex marriage, arguing it was \"clearly wrong when it was decided.\" \"Obergefell, like Roe v. Wade, ignored two centuries of our nation's history,\" Cruz said on his podcast The Cloakroom , adding he believed the court was \"overreaching.\"\n\nMarriage equality has come under threat in light of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade , which declared the landmark 1973 ruling \"egregiously wrong\" because the right to an abortion is not expressly stated in the Constitution or \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\" The court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges , which legalized same-sex marriage, is one of a number of major rulings that's based on similar legal grounds as Roe, raising fears that the court will overturn marriage equality next under similar reasoning. Thomas suggested as much in his concurrence on the opinion overturning Roe, arguing Obergefell and other rulings that uphold the rights to birth control and same-sex relations are \"erroneous\" and the court has \"a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents.\" Loving v. Virginia, which legalized interracial marriage, is also based on similar legal grounds and could be under threat, though Thomas-who is himself in an interracial marriage-did not single out that ruling. Prior to the Obergefell ruling, 35 states had bans on same-sex marriage in their state constution or state law, according to the Pew Research Trust, which could take effect again if the decision is overturned.\n\nClarence Thomas: Court Should Reconsider Gay Marriage, Birth Control Decisions Next After Overturning Roe (Forbes)\n\nWithout Obergefell, Most States Would Have Same-Sex Marriage Bans (Pew)\n\nTed Cruz latest Republican to push back against SCOTUS' gay marriage ruling (Axios)"

Two decades into the 21st Century and the matter of race still haunts the human race; Selassie's hope seems a forlorn one.\n\nThe world thankfully has changed since the 1970s and the acceptance of interracial marriage and mixed-race children has been transformed since those benighted times of ignorance.\n\nFor today's so-called millennials, the notion of racism is anathema and as they age and become decision-makers outstripping the existing gerontocracy, things will improve. Not before time.\n\nHowever, there are other less obvious pockets of racial disharmony that are currently affecting the digital native generation and the digital dating scene is one such area.\n\nThe dating scene will never be uncomplicated. Source: Kevin Dooley (via Flickr creative commons)\n\nApps such as Tinder create a giant community where the majority opinion tends to dominate and creates an echo chamber that also reflects racial make-up; generally those who date within their own race are in the ascendant.\n\nHowever, not only does this push away racial/ethnic minorities, but it also influences others to conform to social norms such as dating within the same race. In turn, it creates a bad experience for minorities and excludes people. The digital ghetto can be as alienating as the physical one.\n\nSo step forward US entrepreneur Vu Tran who has created the Color Dating dating app to try and solve this modern-day societal mismatch. Tran was born in Vietnam and has lived in black urban US areas where he was regularly told by black girls that 'I don't date Asians'.\n\nColor Dating openly encourages people of different ethnicity to date each other and to break down the passive cultural barriers that Tran experienced.\n\n\"Race is part of one's physical attributes, and although people don't like to talk about it, it undeniably plays a huge part in how someone selects their partner. By giving people an outlet and promoting a community of individualism, we see that all ethnicities on our platform get roughly the same amount of matches,\" he says.\n\nVC-funded and a Y Combinator startup, Tran's original startup was an AI bot, but made the pivot when he realised how passionately he wanted to create a better community than the other niche dating sites out there.\n\nAccording to Tran, among men, Asian men and black men have statistically the worst experience when it comes to online dating and there is a clear market for such a product.\n\nTo date (so to speak), the app has done well and been downloaded 60,000 times since its release earlier this year and the message seems to be getting through. More than 50% of women using Color Dating are African-American and 30% of men are Asian.\n\n\"Race/ethnicity is an area we're starting largely because it's a problem I've experienced. But I believe an app that promotes more individuality will lead to better long lasting matches for our users, and for us, more data for targeted ads.\n\n\"I can see us not only in the racial/ethnical space, but also expanding into building communities of people of different religions, socio-economic standing, hobbies, jobs,\" concludes Tran.\n\nWhile Tran dreams of migrating his product into other areas, other earlier migrations define humanity. Data this week from the Harvard Medical School reports all non-Africans today descended from a single migration out of Africa 50,000 years ago, something only underscores the previous comment from Ethiopia's Haile Selassie.\n\nSkin color, indeed should be of no more significant that the color of somebody's eyes and Tran's plan for the dating people of the world to unite is one that Selassie, and Bob Marley, would undoubtedly endorse."

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThis year marks the 54th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court decision that struck down U.S. laws against interracial marriage. Richard and Mildred Loving, whose marriage we celebrate every year on June 12, were an interracial marriage that changed America, whose love forced a court to rule that \"distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry\" are \"odious to a free people.\"\n\nThe Loving case is personal for me. I am from China and my husband is American. We met online when I came here as a student. I remember eagerly checking my email every day waiting to see what Andrew would say in his next email. Two years later, we were married in North Carolina, the wedding decorations a mixture of Chinese and American styles, just like our marriage.\n\nSixty years ago, our love would have been a crime in some parts of America, like the marriage of General Claire Lee Chennault, a white American military aviator best known for his leadership of the \"Flying Tigers'' in World War II, to Chen Xiangmei, a Chinese war correspondent. The couple lived in Louisiana, where their marriage was illegal under the state's anti-miscegenation law.\n\nEvery interracial union writes another page in the book of Loving's legacy. And yet, I start to worry this victory could be undermined.\n\nIt's not due to any racist malintent that I worry these crucial gains are being undermined. Quite the opposite in fact. In 2020, American had a great racial awakening, after George Floyd 's horrifying murder was caught on tape. More and more people started to confront racism, which was of course a very positive change. Yet as the movement progressed, the necessary correction began to take a troubling turn.\n\nI learned that some activists claim all white people are oppressors, while people of other racial groups are oppressed victims. I learned that they think that a racial power dynamic exists in every interaction between white and nonwhite people, and thus oppression is present in every activity of life. Acknowledging and fighting against white people's oppressive role, I learned, is essential for \"anti-racism.\" And refusing to acknowledge it is \" White Fragility .\"\n\nAs the people around me became more deeply mired in this worldview, I wondered, where does interracial marriage belong in these narratives? Why would oppressed persons want to marry oppressors? And if these activists are right, wouldn't we have to conclude that no authentic relationship could exist between white and nonwhite people?\n\nWhen we got married, my husband promised \"to be my wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.\" Is an oppressor capable of fulfilling this promise?\n\nAs someone who is deeply in love with a white person, I strongly disagree with this \"oppressor/victim\" narrative. It erases my love for my husband. It erases my humanity.\n\nThis is why I believe that to be truly anti-racist, we must uphold common humanity first.\n\nIt is counterproductive to fight racism with labels like \"oppressor\" and \"fragility.\" It only shuts down heartfelt conversations. It builds walls rather than breaking them down.\n\nThis view is one I developed over time. Along with my academic research, I have worked on various Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committees for years, where I became convinced of my human-centered view. But many of my fellow academics were moving in the opposite direction. After realizing that the anti-racist narrative of oppressor and oppressed had become the dominant view, I became afraid to speak up. I chose instead to wait. I told myself that people would soon realize this method is self-defeating and change course.\n\nThen I saw K-12 schools quietly insert the \"oppressor/victim\" narrative into ethnic studies and social-emotional learning and I started to be truly afraid.\n\nI thought of course of the children of interracial marriages. This misguided narrative could make these children doubt the authenticity of their parents' marriage. They may lose faith in their parents' love when the marriage is going through tough times. I do not want children to interpret a heated argument between my husband and me as a racial struggle between a white man and a Chinese woman, an epic battle between the oppressor and the oppressed.\n\nIn a country with an ugly history of slavery and racial segregation, interracial families have been the ground zero of fighting against prejudice and building bridges. We have spent time educating people about racism, including within our own families. Many white parents deeply feel the racism their mixed-race children face and take a more active role in fighting against interpersonal and structural racism.\n\nAnd yet, if you believe the most extreme anti-racist activists, children born to interracial couples are not created by the love of two free and equal human beings, but the results of a relationship between an oppressor and a victim. How do you think this would impact how they see themselves?\n\nI believed I had the right to be angry hearing this language take over, but I stayed quiet. There is so much fear going around when it comes to criticizing any aspect of the current anti-racist movement for fear being called a racist.\n\nIt was the movie Loving , based on the story of that loving couple that made my marriage possible, that woke me up. Watching Mrs. Mildred Loving say, \"I will raise my family here, I do not care what they do to us,\" I teared up. I felt like this courageous woman was speaking directly to me.\n\nWe should defend our intrinsic right to be free humans and the desire to be united as humans at all costs. We should all remember what the Supreme Court concluded, that \"distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry\" are \"odious to a free people.\"\n\nI traveled half a world to settle in America. I will raise my family here. I will not allow misguided teachings to tarnish the sanctity of my marriage, invalidate my experience, and create divisions and chaos in my family.\n\nI hope the millions of Lovings in the present day, as well people who cherish interracial marriage, will push back. Otherwise, the Lovings will have been effectively defeated by Virginia in the 2020s.\n\nDr. Ye Zhang Pogue lives in the Greater Boston area with her husband and two cats.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFifty years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled miscegenation laws-or laws preventing people of different races and ethnicities from getting married-unconstitutional. Decades later, interracial marriage is now the highest it has ever been in the United States, up 14 percent compared with what it was in 1967 when the courts ruled in favor of Richard and Mildred Loving , an interracial couple who were thrown in jail in Virginia for violating the state's rules against multicultural love.\n\nOnly 3 percent of couples in the country had intermarried at the time of the ruling, but by 2015, 17 percent of newlyweds in the U.S. had a spouse from a different racial background, according to U.S. Census Bureau data reviewed by the Pew Research Center in a report released Wednesday.  The increase is the highest it has ever been, with interracial marriages of black people nearly tripling from 5 percent to 18 percent since 1980. White newlyweds with spouses of a different ethnicity have also increased, from 4 percent to 11 percent since 1980.\n\nRichard & Mildred Loving, of Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court case that made laws against interracial marriage illegal. True Americans. pic.twitter.com/NNl4OdfoCZ\n\nInterracial marriages aren't just up for black and white love birds. About three in 10, or 29 percent, of Asian newlyweds living in the U.S. entered an interracial marriage in 2015, according to the report. Of those marriages, 27 percent included spouses from Hispanic or Latino decent. As for American-born Asians, 46 percent married someone from a different race in 2015, while 39 percent of American-born Hispanics tied the knot with a person of a different ethnicity in 2015.\n\nPersonal views toward interracial relationships and marriage have changed even more dramatically in the U.S. A separate Pew survey recently found 39 percent of adults viewed intermarriage as a \"good\" thing for society, compared with just 24 percent who advocated for intermarriage in 2010.\n\nAttitudes toward mixed marriages have shifted even more drastically when considering American views on the matter back in 1990, when 63 percent of non-black adults said they would be completely or somewhat opposed to a family member marrying a black person. In 2015, only 14 percent of non-black adults surveyed said they wouldn't agree with a relative marrying a black person.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, many states, particularly ones located in the South, still had regulations that made it illegal for a white person to marry anyone other than a white person. Virginia law also prohibited residents from traveling to other states to avoid miscegenation laws, which is exactly what Richard Loving, a white man, and Mildred Loving, a black and Native American woman, did when they exchanged vows in Washington in 1958.\n\nWhen the couple was found out by the local sheriff of Central Point, Virginia, where they lived, they chose to move to the country's capital and later had three children. It wasn't until they returned to Virginia for a visit in 1967 that they were imprisoned for engaging in an interracial marriage.\n\nTheir case made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously ruled miscegenation laws violated the Constitution, most evidently the 14th Amendment. And on June 12, 1967, marriage across racial and ethnic lines was deemed federally legal in the U.S.\n\nSome states took longer than others to adapt to the ruling. Alabama was the last state to completely lift bans against interracial marriage in 2000.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court 's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade ,Whoopi Goldberg warned Justice Clarence Thomas about his marriage to his wife Ginni, suggesting that conservatives could soon come for his interracial marriage by overturning Loving v. Virginia .\n\n\"You better hope that they don't come for you, Clarence, and say you should not be married to your wife, who happens to be white, because they will move back,\" Goldberg said on Monday's episode of The View . \"And you better hope that nobody says, you know, well, you're not in the Constitution. You're back to being a quarter of a person.\"\n\nThomas, who is widely held as the most conservative justice on the high court, joined the majority opinion released Friday that struck down the landmark 1973 ruling in Roe , which established the constitutional right to obtaining an abortion.\n\nThe 74-year-old justice faced widespread backlash for his concurring opinion, in which he suggested he would also be prepared to reconsider the decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States, saying the court has \"a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents.\"\n\nA number of critics have accused Thomas of being hypocritical in his position, pointing out that while Obergerfell was decided on the same grounds as Loving v. Virginia , he has remained quiet about overturning the 1967 decision that ruled laws banning interracial marriage to be unconstitutional.\n\nThomas married his wife, who is a right-wing activist, in 1987. The justice has recently faced calls to recuse himself from any cases related to the Capitol riot and the 2020 presidential election after publicized texts showed his wife repeatedly urging former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to overturn the election results.\n\nGoldberg isn't the only notable figure to slam Thomas for staying mum on Loving . Actor Samuel L. Jackson tweeted on Friday, \"How's Uncle Clarence feeling about Overturning Loving v Virginia??!!\"\n\nJim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the 2015 Supreme Court ruling, also spoke out against Thomas , saying that he failed to mention Loving because it \"affects him personally.\"\n\n\"That affects him personally, but he doesn't care about the LGBTQ+ community,\" Obergefell told MSNBC 's The Reid Out on Friday. \"He is opposed to our equality. He is opposed to our ability to actually be a part of 'we the people.'\"\n\n\"For Justice Thomas to completely omit Loving v. Virginia , in my mind, is quite telling,\" he added.\n\nBoth Loving and Obergerfell concerned the equal protection and due process clauses guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn Loving , the court issued a unanimous decision ending all race-based legal restrictions on marriage across the nation after Mildred Loving, a woman of color, and her husband Richard Loving, who was white, appealed their convictions in Virginia for marrying each other. Justices said that Virginia violated the equal protection clause because the law was based solely on \"distinctions drawn according to race.\"\n\nSimilarly, in Obergerfell , the court decided in a 5-4 ruling that the due process clause would \"extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs.\"\n\nCiting Loving and other decisions, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion that for the petitioners in Obergerfell , \"Their plea is that they do respect [marriage], respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves.\"\n\n\"Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right,\" Kennedy concluded.\n\nKatherine Fung is a Newsweek senior reporter based in New York City.

But instead of ignoring the remarks, he is using humor to highlight their absurdity.\n\nAn Instagram reel posted by Bouchard (@koltertalks) has gone viral after he responded to a comment condemning him for not being able to \"attract a white woman.\" Bouchard's biting response to the comment-and to racist comments as a whole on his account-struck a chord with over 156,000 viewers who liked the video. He told Newsweek why it is important for him to tackle these comments head-on.\n\n\"I think about this unserious, unseasoned comment and the guy who made it every single day,\" Bouchard began in the video. \"First off, hilarious coming from a guy who couldn't attract wind in a hurricane, and second, imagine seeing a couple this fine and aligned and thinking, 'I better wipe my Cheeto-dusted fingers on my shirt, so I can type this foolishness.'\"\n\nHe continued: \"I get comments like this every single day, and it's like, what is the point?

He describes his online community of 1.5 million as \"funny, kind and supportive,\" often rallying against negativity before he even has to step in.\n\n\"When I spot racist comments, I typically see multiple responses condemning them-my community often beats me to the proverbial punch,\" Bouchard said.\n\nHis content is rooted in love, but also in advocacy .\n\n\"My wife, Dominique, is Black, and she experiences racism and sexism-and the intersection of the two-inside and outside the comment section,\" Bouchard said. \"I use that platform-and my privilege as a white man-to show people how hair-pullingly stupid these comments are.\"\n\nA post shared by Kolter Bouchard (@koltertalks)\n\n\"I use humor to conduct these conversations because first, I'm very funny, and second, it's a far more engaging tactic than sternly wagging a finger at folks,\" he said.\n\nBouchard and Dominique met as 18-year-old freshmen in broadcasting school and recently celebrated 10 years of marriage. Their journey together has taken them across the world, from living and working in Dubai to launching their own marketing and production company. But not all of it has been easy, and they have been through more than online hate.\n\n\"We've weathered COVID and cancer-I've been in remission from Hodgkin's for almost four years-quit our jobs to launch our marketing and production company, and just celebrated our daughter's fifth birthday,\" Bouchard said.\n\nThe couple also cohost a podcast, Playing House , where they discuss keeping relationships \"sexy and secure.\"\n\nThrough humor and candid conversations, Bouchard continues to challenge stereotypes while uplifting his wife and their love story. And, as he made clear in his video, no amount of negativity will change that.\n\n\"The reality is I do not care about anybody's opinion but hers.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThirty-six Republicans on Tuesday voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would protect same-sex and interracial marriages in the United States.\n\nTwelve Republicans voted in favor of the bill, which passed the Senate by a vote of 61-36. Among those who backed the measure was GOP Senator Rob Portman , whose views on gay marriage changed after his son came out as gay in 2013. The bill is now one step closer to becoming law as Democrats face their final few weeks as the dominant party in the House of Representatives after Republicans secured a majority in the midterm elections this month.\n\nThe 36 Republicans who voted against the bill are: Senators John Barrasso; Marsha Blackburn ; John Boozman; Mike Braun; Bill Cassidy ; John Cornyn; Tom Cotton; Kevin Cramer; Mike Crapo; Ted Cruz ; Steve Daines; Deb Fischer; Lindsey Graham ; Chuck Grassley ; Bill Hagerty; Josh Hawley ; John Hoeven; Cindy Hyde-Smith; Jim Inhofe ; Ron Johnson ; John Neely Kennedy; James Lankford ; Mike Lee ; Roger Marshall ; Mitch McConnell ; Jerry Moran; Rand Paul ; Jim Risch; Mike Rounds; Marco Rubio ; Rick Scott; Tim Scott; Richard Shelby; John Thune; Tommy Tuberville ; and Roger Wicker.\n\nSeveral of these senators have provided insight on why they opposed the legislation.\n\nGraham tweeted Tuesday evening that his \"chief objection\" was what he described as \"lackluster provisions in the bill protecting religious liberties.\" He said that an amendment that was proposed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, which the Senate struck down on Tuesday, \"would have clearly achieved religious liberty protection.\"\n\nLee described his amendment as barring the federal government from \"retaliating against any person or group for adhering to sincerely held religious beliefs and moral convictions about marriage.\"\n\nCruz and Cornyn, both Texas lawmakers, have also cited religious liberty in their reasons for objecting to the bill by suggesting that it could pave the way for lawsuits against religious institutions that are against same-sex marriage, The Texas Tribune reported.\n\nAn Associated Press fact check determined that the Respect for Marriage Act would not allow churches or other organizations to be sued for their marriage stances. The act would also not pave the way for churches to be denied their tax-exempt status if they don't support same-sex marriages, the AP found.\n\nThe bill does not require religious organizations to perform same-sex marriages, and religious groups' tax status will not be impacted by what kinds of marriages they do or don't officiate.\n\nThe bill's advancement came amid fears that same-sex marriages in the U.S. could be in danger after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, rolling back federal abortion rights nearly 50 years after the landmark decision.\n\nConservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas issued a concurring opinion at the time suggesting that the court should \"reconsider\" several other cases, including Obergefell v. Hodges , the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act does not ensure that same-sex marriages will remain legal in all U.S. states, but it would require states that ban same-sex marriages to recognize legal same-sex marriages from other states in the event that Obergefell is overturned.\n\nThe bill also aims to protect interracial marriages by requiring states to recognize legal marriages regardless of \"sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.\"\n\nThe bill now heads back to the House, where it is expected to pass swiftly. The House passed a version of the act in July, but it has since been amended to provide protections for religious liberties in order to secure support from GOP senators who may have opposed it otherwise. Twelve GOP senators joined Democrats in a 61-35 vote on Monday to invoke cloture, or end debate, in order to advance the legislation to the final vote on Tuesday.\n\nAfter the House, the bill goes to President Joe Biden for his final signature. The president has confirmed that he plans to sign the legislation into law if and when it arrives on his desk.\n\n\"President Biden is calling on Congress to send the Respect for Marriage Act to his desk to secure the fundamental right of Americans to marry the person they love,\" the White House tweeted on November 19.\n\nUpdate 11/30/22, 11:40 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nZoe Strozewski is a Newsweek reporter based in New Jersey.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nToday is the 53rd anniversary commemorating the landmark decision made by United States' Supreme Court in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down state laws that forbidding interracial marriage. The annual celebration is inspired by the remarkable true story of interracial couple, Richard and Mildred Loving.\n\nRichard Loving (Edgerton) was a white construction worker who fell madly in love with a local black woman, Mildred Jeter (Negga). But the Racial Integrity Law of 1924 would not grant the marriage license unless the \"applicants are of pure white race.\"\n\nIn 1958, the couple had to travel from Virginia to Washington, D.C., where their vows would be considered legal. After exchanging their wedding vows, they returned home five weeks later to unopened arms. In the middle of the night, Virginian police officers stormed into their bedroom and arrested them for breaking the law, per Biography .\n\nCan you imagine the emotional turmoil a pregnant Mildred Loving went through as she was locked up in a prison cell and branded a criminal? Charged with unlawful cohabitation, the married couple could be jailed if they were to remain in Virginia. At the time, there were about 20 states that had outlawed marriage between races. The Lovings decided to return to Washington D.C., where they raised their three children for the next five years.\n\nIn 1963 during the Civil Rights Movement, Mildred sent a letter to U.S. attorney general Robert F. Kennedy in 1963. After being referred to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Lovings were able to take their case to the Supreme Court four years later. With the Supreme Court judges ruling in unanimous favor, Chief Justice Earl Warren declared, \"Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.\"\n\nNot only did the Supreme Court decision repeal marriage bans on the basis of race, the Lovings were finally able to go back home to Virginia. Though her husband died in car accident in 1975, the widow became a prominent voice in the support for gay marriage.\n\nOne year before her death in 2008, the civil rights activist released a public statement on Loving Day's 40th Anniversary , \"I believe all Americans, no matter their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual orientation, should have that same freedom to marry.\"\n\n\"Government has no business imposing some people's religious beliefs over others. I support the freedom to marry for all. That's what Loving and loving are all about,\" added Loving.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

      "text": "No, the Supreme Court is Not Going to Reconsider the Constitutionality of Bans on Interracial Marriage\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nDavid Bernstein | 5.11.2022 4:09 PM\n\nThere's a lot of loose talk going around about the potential consequences of the Court's pending decision to overrule Roe v. Wade . Among other things, some serious people, such as several law professors in this Vox symposium , are suggesting that the Court may overrule Loving v. Virginia, which held that laws prohibiting interracial marriages are unconstitutional. After all, if abortion is not a firmly established historical right protected by the Due Process Clause, then perhaps neither is interracial marriage.\n\nThere are three reasons why Loving is safe.\n\nFirst, over ninety percent of Americans approve of interracial marriage (compared to four percent in 1958!). Even more presumably think it should not be illegal, even if they disapprove of it. As a result, no state is going to ban interracial marriage, so no case will come to SCOTUS.\n\nSecond, overruling Loving would be politically unthinkable. The Supreme Court does not just follow the election returns, but it also does not go out of its way to overturn firm precedent that has the support of over ninety percent of the public and the demise of which would cause mass bipartisan public outrage.\n\nThird, and most important, the Loving decision invalidated bans on miscegenation first and foremost on equal protection grounds, as an illegal racial classification, with the due process right to marriage only a secondary rationale. In the very unlikely event the Court were inclined to revisit the due process right to marry, Loving would be safe because of its equal protection holding.\n\nHere's the Court:\n\nWhile the state court is no doubt correct in asserting that marriage is a social relation subject to the State's police power, Maynard v. Hill, 125 U. S. 190 (1888), the State does not contend in its argument before this Court that its powers to regulate marriage are unlimited notwithstanding the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nor could it do so in light of Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923), and Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535 (1942). Instead, the State argues that the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause, as illuminated by the statements of the Framers, is only that state penal laws containing an interracial element as part of the definition of the offense must apply equally to whites and Negroes in the sense that members of each race are punished to the same degree. Thus, the State contends that, because its miscegenation statutes punish equally both the white and the Negro participants in an interracial marriage, these statutes, despite their reliance on racial classifications, do not constitute an invidious discrimination based upon race. The second argument advanced by the State assumes the validity of its equal application theory. The argument is that, if the Equal Protection Clause does not outlaw miscegenation statutes because of their reliance on racial classifications, the question of constitutionality would thus become whether there was any rational basis for a State to treat interracial marriages differently from other marriages. On this question, the State argues, the scientific evidence is substantially in doubt and, consequently, this Court should defer to the wisdom of the state legislature in adopting its policy of discouraging interracial marriages.\n\nBecause we reject the notion that the mere \"equal application\" of a statute containing racial classifications is enough to remove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment's proscription of all invidious racial discriminations , we do not accept the State's contention that these statutes should be upheld if there is any possible basis for concluding that they serve a rational purpose. The mere fact of equal application does not mean that our analysis of these statutes should follow the approach we have taken in cases involving no racial discrimination where the Equal Protection Clause has been arrayed against a statute discriminating between the kinds of advertising which may be displayed on trucks in New York City, Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. New York, 336 U. S. 106 (1949), or an exemption in Ohio's ad valorem tax for merchandise owned by a nonresident in a storage warehouse, Allied Stores of Ohio , Inc. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522 (1959). In these cases, involving distinctions not drawn according to race, the Court has merely asked whether there is any rational foundation for the discriminations, and has deferred to the wisdom of the state legislatures. In the case at bar, however, we deal with statutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race.\n\nThe State argues that statements in the Thirty-ninth Congress about the time of the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment indicate that the Framers did not intend the Amendment to make unconstitutional state miscegenation laws. Many of the statements alluded to by the State concern the debates over the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, which President Johnson vetoed, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, enacted over his veto. While these statements have some relevance to the intention of Congress in submitting the Fourteenth Amendment, it must be understood that they pertained to the passage of specific statutes, and not to the broader, organic purpose of a constitutional amendment. As for the various statements directly concerning the Fourteenth Amendment, we have said in connection with a related problem that, although these historical sources \"cast some light\" they are not sufficient to resolve the problem; \"[a]t best, they are inconclusive. The most avid proponents of the post-War Amendments undoubtedly intended them to remove all legal distinctions among 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States.' Their opponents, just as certainly, were antagonistic to both the letter and the spirit of the Amendments, and wished them to have the most limited effect.\"\n\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 , 347 U. S. 489 (1954). See also Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 , 100 U. S. 310 (1880). We have rejected the proposition that the debates in the Thirty-ninth Congress or in the state legislatures which ratified the Fourteenth Amendment supported the theory advanced by the State, that the requirement of equal protection of the laws is satisfied by penal laws defining offenses based on racial classifications so long as white and Negro participants in the offense were similarly punished. McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184 (1964).\n\nThe State finds support for its \"equal application\" theory in the decision of the Court in Pace v. Alabama, 106 U. S. 583 (1883). In that case, the Court upheld a conviction under an Alabama statute forbidding adultery or fornication between a white person and a Negro which imposed a greater penalty than that of a statute proscribing similar conduct by members of the same race. The Court reasoned that the statute could not be said to discriminate against Negroes because the punishment for each participant in the offense was the same. However, as recently as the 1964 Term, in rejecting the reasoning of that case, we stated \" Pace represents a limited view of the Equal Protection Clause which has not withstood analysis in the subsequent decisions of this Court.\" McLaughlin v. Florida, supra, at 379 U. S. 188 . As we there demonstrated, the Equal Protection Clause requires the consideration of whether the classifications drawn by any statute constitute an arbitrary and invidious discrimination. The clear and central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate all official state sources of invidious racial discrimination in the States. Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 83 U. S. 71 (1873); Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 , 100 U. S. 307 -308 (1880); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339 , 100 U. S. 334 -335 (1880); Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1 (1948); Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U. S. 715 (1961).\n\nThere can be no question but that Virginia's miscegenation statutes rest solely upon distinctions drawn according to race. The statutes proscribe generally accepted conduct if engaged in by members of different races. Over the years, this Court has consistently repudiated \"[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry\" as being \"odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\" Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81 , 320 U. S. 100 (1943). At the very least, the Equal Protection Clause demands that racial classifications, especially suspect in criminal statutes, be subjected to the \"most rigid scrutiny,\" Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 , 323 U. S. 216 (1944), and, if they are ever to be upheld, they must be shown to be necessary to the accomplishment of some permissible state objective, independent of the racial discrimination which it was the object of the Fourteenth Amendment to eliminate. Indeed, two members of this Court have already stated that they \"cannot conceive of a valid legislative purpose . . . which makes the color of a person's skin the test of whether his conduct is a criminal offense.\"\n\nMcLaughlin v. Florida, supra, at 379 U. S. 198 (STEWART, J., joined by DOUGLAS, J., concurring).\n\nThere is patently no legitimate overriding purpose independent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy. [ Footnote 11 ] We have consistently denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens on account of race. There can be no doubt that restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nII\n\nThese statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\n\nMarriage is one of the \"basic civil rights of man,\" fundamental to our very existence and survival. Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535 , 316 U. S. 541 (1942). See also Maynard v. Hill, 125 U. S. 190 (1888). To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.\n\nThese convictions must be reversed.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

The Washington Post reports :\n\nAccording to the Pew study, about 15 percent of new marriages in 2010 crossed racial or ethnic lines, double the rate from three decades ago. Intermarriages comprise 8 percent of all marriages now, up from just 3 percent in 1980. And most Americans tell pollsters they are untroubled at the prospect of intermarriage in their own family.\n\nAt one point 41 states outlawed interracial marriages. Back in 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in the case Loving v. Virginia that banning interracial marriage violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Virginia judge who had upheld the ban repugnantly argued [PDf]:\n\n\"Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\"\n\nAs a resident of the Commonwealth, I happily note, 45 years after Loving v. Virginia, that the Post reports this wonderful historical irony:\n\nVirginia leads the nation in the percentage of marriages between blacks and whites....\n\nGo here to see the full Pew report.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "There's No Constitutional Right to Interracial (or Same-Sex) Marriage, Says the Architect of the Texas \"Heartbeat Bill\"\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nLGBT\n\nDale Carpenter | 9.22.2021 12:58 PM\n\nIn an earlier post , I noted that the vast majority of the 81 briefs in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health supporting Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban were mum about Obergefell v. Hodges , which held same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry under the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause. My review also indicates that most of them have relatively little to say explicitly about any of the other substantive due process precedents--preferring to treat Roe and Casey like tumors that can be excised without affecting the rest of the body. This silence may be strategic, but it's nonetheless notable.\n\nThe main exception is the amicus brief filed on behalf of Texas Right to Life (TRL), written by Jonathan Mitchell and Adam Mortara. Mitchell was \" the conceptual force behind \" SB8, the Texas \"Heartbeat Bill,\" which effectively bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy and authorizes \"any person\" to seek an injunction and award of at least $10,000 against those who assist women obtaining such abortions. Mitchell was a clerk for the late Justice Scalia and is a former Solicitor General of Texas.  Mortara was a clerk for Justice Thomas and is a lead lawyer in the challenge against Harvard's affirmative action program, seeking to have the Court overrule its landmark 2003 decision upholding race-conscious admissions policies. Both have sterling credentials within the conservative legal movement. Their brief will be closely read in the Justices' chambers.\n\nThe TRL brief maintains that the constitutional right to abortion declared in Roe and reaffirmed in Casey has no basis in constitutional text or history and that stare decisis should not prevent them from being overruled. So far, so expected.\n\nBut there are many other decisions that similarly lack any constitutional grounding, the brief says. Among these is Loving v. Virginia , which struck down a state anti-miscegenation law in part on substantive due process grounds.\n\nSupporters of Roe have correctly observed that this Court has recognized and enforced other supposed constitutional \"rights\" that have no basis in constitutional text or historical practice. The Casey plurality opinion, for example, noted that right [sic] to interracial marriage from Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967), has no textual or historical pedigree, much like the right to abortion that this Court invented in Roe v. Wade . . .  To be sure, the rationale of Loving purported to invoke the doctrine of substantive due process and a supposed constitutional \"freedom to marry,\" which is nowhere to be found in the language of the Constitution.  (pp. 22-23)\n\nThe conclusion that the constitutional right to marry is baseless follows from a larger critique of substantive due process common within conservative legal circles, including among some Justices. But few publicly acknowledge the full implications of the argument for the unenumerated substantive-due-process right to marry, much less specifically for the right to marry a person of a different race. Give Mitchell and Mortara credit for candor.\n\nStill, a Supreme Court advocate cannot be heard to question the outcome in Loving . So while rejecting the substantive due process holding, the TRL brief attempts to reach the same result by asserting that \"the Civil Rights Act of 1866 provides all the authority needed to set aside a state's anti-miscegenation law.\" That's because the 1866 Act prohibits racial discrimination under state law in making and enforcing contracts and, the authors assert, marriage is a contract subject to this statute. \"So Loving remains good law regardless of whether the Constitution's text or historical practice can support a right to interracial marriage,\" the brief concludes.\n\nThis analysis is curious in several ways. First, the TRL brief is essentially saying that marriage rights for interracial couples are secure only by congressional grace, not by fundamental constitutional law. Congress would be free to revoke that protection (though it assuredly would not do so these days). Second, the argument suggests that in 1967 bans on interracial marriage had already been illegal under federal law for more than a century. That certainly would have been news to the 16 states that still had such laws. Indeed, historically, all but nine states enacted anti-miscegenation laws at some point. Third, the TRL brief ignores the independent holding of Loving that bans on interracial marriages are unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. Is there no textual or historical basis for that holding? Fourth, the TRL brief characterizes the issue as involving \"a right to interracial marriage\" rather than as involving \"a right to marriage\" that interracial couples must be allowed to exercise .\n\nIn places, the brief reads like a progressive parody of the conservative critique of unenumerated constitutional rights--conceiving rights in the narrowest way and then, so conceived, finding no constitutional support for them. But at least TRL finds a way to conclude that states must allow interracial marriages.\n\nAccording to TRL, however, \"the news is not as good for those who hope to preserve the court-invented rights to homosexual behavior and same-sex marriage.\" The rights announced in Lawrence and Obergefell \"are judicial concoctions, and there is no other source of law that can be invoked to salvage their existence.\" While \"far less hazardous to human life,\" they are just \"as lawless as Roe .\"\n\nHere the brief specifically rejects Mississippi's view that Obergefell might survive in a post- Roe world .\n\nMississippi suggests that Obergefell could be defended by invoking the \"fundamental right to marry\" which is \"'fundamental as a matter of history and tradition.'\" Pet. Br. at 13 (quoting Obergefell , 576 U.S. at 671). But a \"fundamental right\" must be defined with specificity before assessing whether that right is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\" See Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997) (requiring federal courts to employ a \"careful description\" of conduct or behavior that a litigant alleges to be protected by the Constitution, and forbidding resort to generalizations and abstractions). Otherwise long-prohibited conduct can be made into a \"fundamental right\" that is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition,\" so long as a litigant is creative enough to define the \"right\" at a high enough level of abstraction. The right to marry an opposite-sex spouse spouse is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition\"; the right to marry a same-sex spouse obviously is not.\n\nLike the \"right to interracial marriage,\" according to TRL, the \"right to same-sex marriage\" is nowhere to be found in the Constitution. There is no right to marriage in the text, so there is of course no right to marriage that same-sex couples must be allowed to exercise . Further, TRL says, states must even be allowed to criminalize sexual intimacy in the privacy of gay couples' homes .\n\nWhat's notable about this line of argument is how unremarkable it is in mainstream conservative legal critiques of substantive due process, Obergefell , and Lawrence. It's a critique some of the Justices endorse. No doubt many of Mississippi's amici also share it, although they are not as forthcoming.\n\nIn the end, Mitchell and Mortara say they are not necessarily asking the Court to overrule Obergefell and Lawrence right now, but they believe it would be nice if the Court wrote \"an opinion that leaves those decisions hanging by a thread.\"\n\nThere are many ways to distinguish abortion from gay marriage, some of which are relevant to constitutional law. Among other things, both equal protection and stare decisis will figure differently in these contexts. But if the influential architect of SB8 and his widely respected co-author somehow persuade a majority of the Justices to write an opinion eviscerating substantive due process, one thread supporting Obergefell will be a lot easier to cut.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Virginia\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nJosh Blackman | 6.28.2022 12:37 AM\n\nJustice Thomas is married to a white woman. And the couple lives in Virginia. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Loving v. Virginia , the law of the Commonwealth criminalized interracial marriage. In the wake of Dobbs , critics have tried to hoist Justice Thomas on his own petard: Oh yeah, you would overrule Obergefell , but what about Loving ? Indeed, Justice McDonald of the Connecticut Supreme Court , who is in a same-sex marriage, got in on the fun with some wordplay:\n\n\"Mr. Justice Thomas had much to say today about my loving marriage. Oddly he didn't have much to say about his 'Loving' marriage.\"\n\nThis argument was predictable, and flawed.\n\nFirst, Justice Thomas already addressed the status of Loving in his Obergefell dissent. And he expressly distinguished Loving from Obergefell .\n\nPetitioners' misconception of liberty carries over into their discussion of our precedents identifying a right to marry, not one of which has expanded the concept of \"liberty\" beyond the concept of negative liberty. Those precedents all involved absolute prohibitions on private actions associated with marriage. Loving v. Virginia , 388 U. S. 1 (1967), for example, involved a couple who was criminally prosecutedfor marrying in the District of Columbia and cohabiting in Virginia, id., at 2-3. [FN5] They were each sentenced to a year of imprisonment, suspended for a term of 25 years on the condition that they not reenter the Commonwealth together during that time. Id., at 3. [FN6]\n\n[FN5] The suggestion of petitioners and their amici that antimiscegenation laws are akin to laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman is both offensive and inaccurate. \"America's earliest laws against interracial sex and marriage were spawned by slavery.\" P. Pascoe, What Comes Naturally: Miscegenation Law and the Making of Race in America 19 (2009). For instance, Maryland's 1664 law prohibiting marriages between \" 'freeborne English women' \" and \" 'Negro Sla[v]es' \" was passed as part of the very act that authorized lifelong slavery in the colony. Id., at 19-20 . Virginia's antimiscegenation laws likewise were passed in a 1691 resolution entitled \"An act for suppressing outlying Slaves.\" Act of Apr. 1691, Ch. XVI, 3 Va. Stat. 86 (W. Hening ed. 1823) (reprint 1969) (italics deleted). \"It was not until the Civil War threw the future of slavery into doubt that lawyers, legislators, and judges began to develop the elaborate justifications that signified the emergence of miscegenation law and made restrictions on interracial marriage the foundation of post-Civil War white supremacy.\" Pascoe, supra , at 27-28. Laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman do not share this sordid history. The traditional definition of marriage has prevailed in every society that has recognized marriage throughout history. Brief for Scholars of History and Related Disciplines as Amici Curiae 1. It arose not out of a desire to shore up an invidious institution like slavery, but out of a desire \"to increase the likelihood that children will be born and raised in stable and enduring family units by both the mothers and the fathers who brought them into this world.\" Id., at 8. And it has existed in civilizations containing all manner of views on homosexuality. See Brief for Ryan T. Anderson as Amicus Curiae 11-12 (explaining that several famous ancient Greeks wrote approvingly of the traditional definition of marriage, though same-sex sexual relations were common in Greece at the time).\n\n[FN6] The prohibition extended so far as to forbid even religious ceremonies, thus raising a serious question under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause, as at least one amicus brief at the time pointed out. Brief for John J. Russell et al. as Amici Curiae in Loving v. Virginia , O.T. 1966, No. 395, pp. 12-16.\n\nI hope that distinction will suffice. And I trust Justice McDonald can read the Obergefell dissent to learn Justice Thomas's views on Loving .\n\nSecond, Loving was premised on both the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause. Even if you reject substantive due process, you could still find that Loving reached the correct result on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause. After all, the law literally treats people differently on the basis of their race. Two white people can get married, but a white person and a black person cannot. Even the most conservative jurists would deem such a law unconstitutional.\n\nThird, there is an insinuation lurking in the background of the claim: Justice Thomas did not talk about Loving because doing so would undermine his own marriage. Or, stated differently, Justice Thomas cannot be neutral on the topic of interracial marriage, so he simply ignored the case; thus he is a hypocrite. This charge is perhaps the most pernicious. And it is not new. During the Prop 8 litigation, there was an effort to disqualify Judge Vaughn Walker because he was a gay man who was in a long-term relationship with another man. The defenders of Prop 8 claimed that Judge Walker could not possibly handle the case objectively because he stood to benefit personally from a ruling that Prop 8 was unconstitutional. Ultimately, Walker did not recuse. And he based his decision on a long line of cases involving black judges, who likewise refused to recuse in racial discrimination cases. I like to think that Judge Walker, like Justice Thomas, could objectively assess cases that could affect their personal relationships.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Does the unconstitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws tell us whether federal law bans anti-gay discrimination in employment?\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nVolokh Conspiracy\n\n| 4.8.2017 6:52 PM\n\nLast week, in Hively v. Ivy Tech Community College , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, sitting en banc, held that Title VII's prohibition of discrimination based on sex should be interpreted to include a prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation. The court essentially argued that if you treat someone differently because she is a woman who has romantic relationships with women, as opposed to a man who has romantic relationships with women, that is literally discrimination based on sex. This is true, the court, adds, even if Congress didn't recognize this implication of banning discrimination based on sex in 1964.\n\nI find Judge Diane Sykes's dissent very persuasive, but I thought it was worth addressing one point raised by the majority in some detail, its analogy between Hively and Loving v. Virginia . In Loving , the Supreme Court departed from an almost 100-year-old precedent and held that a state prohibition on interracial marriage violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause.\n\nHere is the relevance of Loving , according to the majority:\n\nAs we noted earlier, Hively also has argued that action based on sexual orientation is sex discrimination under the associational theory. It is now accepted that a person who is discriminated against because of the protected characteristic of one with whom she associates is actually being disadvantaged because of her own traits. This line of cases began with Loving, in which the Supreme Court held that \"restricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifications violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection Clause.\" 388 U.S. at 12. The Court rejected the argument that miscegenation statutes do not violate equal protection because they \"punish equally both the white and the Negro participants in an interracial marriage.\" Id. at 8. When dealing with a statute containing racial classifications, it wrote, \"the fact of equal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden of justification\" required by the Fourteenth Amendment for lines drawn by race. Id. at 9. In effect, both parties to the interracial marriage were being denied important rights by the state solely on the basis of their race....\n\nThe dissent implies that we are adopting an anachronistic view of Title VII, enacted just three years before Loving, but it is the dissent's understanding of Loving and the miscegenation laws that is an anachronism. Thanks to Loving and the later cases we mentioned, society understands now that such laws are (and always were) inherently racist. But as of 1967 (and thus as of 1964), Virginia and 15 other states had anti-miscegenation laws on the books. Loving, 388 U.S. at 6. These laws were long defended and understood as non-discriminatory because the legal obstacle affected both partners. The Court in Loving recognized that equal application of a law that prohibited conduct only between members of different races did not save it. Changing the race of one partner made a difference in determining the legality of the conduct, and so the law rested on \"distinctions drawn according to race,\" which were unjustifiable and racially discriminatory. 4 Loving, 388 U.S. at 11. So too, here. If we were to change the sex of one partner in a lesbian relationship, the outcome would be different. This reveals that the discrimination rests on distinctions drawn according to sex.\n\nI don't think this analogy quite works. The equal protection clause doesn't prohibit \"race discrimination,\" as such, by the states; rather, it prohibits the states from denying any individual \"equal protection of the law.\" As understood in the late 19th century (and I think as properly understood today), a court faced with an equal protection challenge identified the relevant classification made by the law. If the classification was arbitrary or oppressive, then the law was unconstitutional. If the classification was not arbitrary or oppressive, then the law was constitutional.\n\nWhen anti-miscegenation laws were initially upheld in the late 19th century, racial classifications, likely contrary to the framer's intent, received no more scrutiny than any other classification. Moreover, as witnessed by the majority opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson , most judges thought that racial classifications were generally non-arbitrary, but instead reflected both real racial differences and natural antipathy among the races.\n\nBy the time Loving was decided, by contrast, the Supreme Court had created rules of construction under which the vast majority of classifications enjoy a very strong presumption of constitutionality, while classifications based on race suffer a very strong presumption of unconstitutionality. The court's jurisprudence makes sense if we see it as a modern take on the \"anti-arbitrariness\" principle; we now believe that race is an almost inherently arbitrary classification, while we don't want courts second-guessing \"ordinary\" classifications which are likely to be at least arguably non-arbitrary for fear of judicial overreach a la the (mythical version of the) Lochner era.\n\nIn short, the underlying principle, that the 14th Amendment protects individuals from arbitrary and oppressive discrimination by the government, hasn't changed. What's changed is our collective understanding that race is generally an arbitrary classification. Once one has a strong presumption that racial classifications are arbitrary, it becomes clear that enforcing a ban an interracial marriage cannot be squared with the equal protection clause.\n\nTitle VII, by contrast, didn't incorporate a general principle, like a ban an arbitrary discrimination, that would invite judges to figure out how to apply that principle in such a way as to include the evolution of social understandings. Rather, Title VII banned specific types of discrimination by legislative fiat, while leaving most types of discrimination - including height, weight, looks, age, political viewpoint, wealth, education and, yes, sexual orientation - untouched. To enforce Title VII against private employers, we don't ask, \"has an employer classified its employees in an arbitrary manner\" but \"has an employers discriminated against an employee based on one of Title VII's prohibited criteria?\" (Such discrimination need not even be arbitrary; an employer not only has to treat religious employees fairly, for example, but must provide reasonable accommodations for their religious obligations).\n\nIn other words, to figure out what sort of discrimination the 14th Amendment bans, we look to the original understanding of equal protection of the laws as a ban on arbitrary classification. The 14th Amendment contains no limiting interpretive principle beyond \"don't allow arbitrary discrimination.\" To figure out what sort of discrimination based on sex Title VII bans, we look to the original understanding of what discrimination based on sex means, which was, as the 7th Circuit had previously held, \"that it is unlawful to discriminate against women because they are women and against men because they are men,\" and that \"Congress had nothing more than the traditional notion of 'sex' in mind when it voted to outlaw sex discrimination.\"\n\nSo while I don't find the 7th Circuit's opinion absurd, and I'm far from troubled by the practical result, I don't think it's wise for judges to interpret a carefully constructed statute aimed at very specific, enumerated types of discrimination the same way they would interpret a constitutional provision that sets forth a general overarching principle - and that's not even taking into consideration another possible distinction, which is the argument that statutes, much more easily amended by Congress, should be construed more strictly than constitutional provisions that are nearly unamendable.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Virginia Legislature to Repeal the Racial Integrity Act of 1924\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nCrime\n\nJosh Blackman | 12.6.2019 8:30 PM\n\nIn Loving v. Virginia (1967), the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of criminal convictions of Richard and Mildred Loving for violating the Racial Integrity Act of 1924. The penultimate sentence of the opinion stated, \"These convictions must be reversed.\" This landmark decision did not purport to \"strike down\" Virginia's ban on interracial marriage. Nor could it. Courts lack a writ of erasure .\n\nTo this day, the Racial Integrity Act remains on the books in Virginia. Of course, it would be unthinkable for any governmental official to enforce the law. He would immediately be sued, and the courts could hold him in contempt for disregarding clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\nYet the statute remains--hopefully not for long.\n\nVirginia Governor Ralph Northam commissioned a panel to recommend repealing racially discriminatory provisions in the Commonwealth's laws. The press release states:\n\nThe Commission's interim report identified dozens of instances of overtly discriminatory language still on our books, including laws banning school integration, prohibiting black and white Virginians from living in the same neighborhoods, and prohibiting interracial marriage. While many of these Acts have been overturned by court decisions or subsequent legislation, they remain enshrined in law.\n\nTo be precise, the Acts were not \"overturned.\" They were merely declared unconstitutional, and state officials were barred from enforcing those laws. But to be sure, these statutes do remain enshrined in law. And they should be repealed.\n\nThe thorough report lists the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 for repeal. The report also identifies a flurry of massive resistance legislation enacted after Brown v. Board of Education (1955). Many of these laws authorized the establishment of private, segregated schools, that would receive public funding. One of the laws actually divested localities of authorities over their schools if they favored integration. Here are the laws passed in 1956:\n\nLater, the Governor was given authority to seize control of the schools, which could then subsequently be closed.\n\nThe report recommends repealing certain laws regarding \"feeble-minded\" individuals. But it does not (as far as I can tell) recommend the repeal of the Sterilization Act of 1924. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of this provision in Buck v. Bell (1927).\n\nThe Sterilization Act of 1924 should be repealed.\n\nVirginia should also repeal its prohibition on sodomy, V A . C ODE A NN . § 18.2-361(A) (West 2014). This statute cannot withstanding constitutional scrutiny after Lawrence v. Texas (2003), and the Fourth Circuit's decision in MacDonald v. Moose (2013) . It should be scrubbed from the statute books.\n\nUpdate : A commenter below writes that Virginia in fact repealed the sodomy provision in 2014:\n\nVirginia repealed its prohibition on sodomy five years ago. See, e.g., Toghill v. Commonwealth, 768 S.E.2d 674, 682 n.1 (Va. 2015) (\"The General Assembly amended Code § 182-361(A) to remove the general provisions forbidding sodomy.\").

      "text": "The Legacy of Loving v. Virginia Lives On in Gay Marriage Rulings\n\nPolitics\n\nA. Barton Hinkle | 3.5.2014 10:30 AM\n\nOpponents of same-sex marriage object, often strenuously, to comparisons with interracial marriage. Homosexuality is a behavior rather than a trait, they contend, and men and women of different races are sexually compatible in a way that same-gender couples are not.\n\nAll analogies are inexact. But for practical purposes, whether the comparison holds up in every possible regard matters less than whether it holds up in legal terms. And from that perspective, the comparison is proving powerful indeed. So far six federal judges have ruled against state restrictions on gay marriage, and every one of them has invoked Loving v. Virginia - the 1967 case in which the Supreme Court struck down Virginia's ban on interracial marriage.\n\nDefenders of bans on same-sex marriage have appealed to tradition - i.e., old habit. That's an awfully weak argument, given our history. Slavery was traditional. Denying women the vote was traditional. So was a lot of gun control.\n\nFederal Judge Arenda Wright Allen certainly didn't buy the argument when she ruled against Virginia's ban.\n\nWright Allen noted that \"other profound infringements upon our citizens' rights have been explained as a consequence of heritage, and those explanations have been found wanting.\" Quoting another Supreme Court case ( Casey ), she said interracial marriage \"was illegal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected against state interference by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause in Loving v. Virginia .\" Elsewhere, she points out that \"nearly identical concerns about the significance of tradition were presented to, and resolved by, the Supreme Court in its Loving decision.\"\n\nLast week a federal judge struck down Texas' ban on gay marriage. Judge Orlando Garcia quotes the same passage from Casey as the one above. He goes on to say that Texas claims the debate is merely definitional: In the state's view, \"plaintiffs are seeking recognition of a 'new right to same-sex marriage' as opposed to the existing 'right to marry.' This Court finds this argument fails, as the Supreme Court did not adopt this line of reasoning in the analogous Loving v. Virginia . Instead of declaring a new right to interracial marriage, the Court held that individuals could not be restricted from exercising their 'existing' right to marry on account of their chosen partner. . . . That is, an interracial marriage was considered to be a subset of 'marriage,' in the same way that same-sex marriage is included within the fundamental right to marry.\"\n\nMoreover, \"this fundamental right to marry also entails the ability to marry the partner of one's choosing. See generally Loving. . . .\"\n\nThe question in Kentucky was slightly different: Whether that state was obliged to recognize the same-sex unions validated by other states. Nevertheless, it also referred to Loving as the basis for concluding that \"marriage is a fundamental right.\" And that state \"laws are subject to the guarantees of individual liberty contained within the United States Constitution.\" And that \"the Supreme Court has refused to allow mere tradition to justify marriage statutes that violate individual liberties.\"\n\nA similar ruling requiring Ohio to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages also cited Loving more than a half-dozen times. And when he struck down Oklahoma's ban on gay marriage, federal judge Terence C. Kern noted that \"in discussing [the] traditional state authority over marriage, the Supreme Court repeatedly used the disclaimer 'subject to constitutional guarantees.' . . . (citing Loving v. Virginia . . . .) A citation to Loving is a disclaimer of enormous proportion.\"\n\nApparently so.\n\nCourts - including the Supreme Court - can be wrong. Sometimes egregiously so. But there is a reason so many courts have referred to Loving again and again: The arguments for laws banning gay marriage and the arguments for laws banning interracial marriage are nearly identical: Tradition. States' rights. Government's presumed interest in the ordering of private relationships for the sake of an ostensible public good.\n\nThose arguments did not hold up in 1967, and they don't hold up now. Government's core purpose consists of protecting people from harm they don't consent to. The trouble confronting opponents of gay marriage, like opponents of interracial marriage before them, is that they can produce nobody whose rights have been violated by somebody else's marriage. The only things ostensibly harmed by gay marriage are inchoate entities such as \"society\" and \"tradition\" and \"the institution of marriage.\" And those simply are not sufficient reasons to infringe on someone else's fundamental liberty.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Richmond Times-Dispatch.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Five Thoughts About The Respect for Marriage Act\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nJosh Blackman | 7.20.2022 10:37 PM\n\nToday the Respect for Marriage Act passed the House by an unexpectedly large margin. And there is movement afoot to see if the bill will garner ten Republican votes to break a Senate filibuster. Ilya addressed the bill here . I'd like to add five more thoughts.\n\nFirst, one of the most effective and pervasive criticisms of Dobbs is that Obergefell is next. If this bill passes, that argument largely goes away. Granted, the bill does not actually require a state to issue a gay marriage license--only that a state must recognize a gay marriage performed out of state. As a result, gay couples might have to obtain licenses from other states. But that burden is minimal. Indeed, it would be fairly simple to apply for a marriage license out of state, and the ceremony can be performed over Zoom.\n\nSecond, the fact that this bill passed the House by such a wide margin illustrates why the Obergefell -is-next argument never worked: there is no national movement to reverse gay marriage. Unlike Roe and Casey , Obergefell was largely accepted without a backlash. Now, there is more than 70% support for gay marriage. There is no march on Washington to reverse Obergefell , like there has been for abortion. Justice Alito was correct in saying this issue has been settled. Obergefell has proven workable in every regard. On the plus side for conservatives, enacting this bill would undermine the non-stop attacks on Dobbs . I'm sure leader McConnell recognizes this fact: passing this bill reduces the need for  Court \"reform.\"\n\nThird, so far I've presumed that Section 3 of the bill is constitutional. Is it? The bill provides, in part:\n\n\"(a) In General .-No person acting under color of State law may deny-\n\n\"(1) full faith and credit to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other State pertaining to a marriage between 2 individuals, on the basis of the sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin of those individuals; or\n\n\"(2) a right or claim arising from such a marriage on the basis that such marriage would not be recognized under the law of that State on the basis of the sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin of those individuals.\n\nThis provision can be tested in one of two ways. First, a state actor could decline to give recognition to a marriage license issued from out of state. That action would trigger a suit by the couple whose marriage was not recognized, or by the United States Attorney General. But that state official would be going rogue. He would not receive qualified immunity--his actions violate clearly established law. And a judge could hold him in contempt if he flouts a court order. The second path is more likely, a state would sue the United States, arguing that Section 3 is unconstitutional. Ring up one more United States v. Texas . Still, at present, every state is required to recognize same-sex marriage licenses under Obergefell . Standing would have to be creative. That is, the federal law inflicts some injury on the state that goes above and beyond what the Supreme Court required.\n\nI have no interest in weighing in on the Full Faith and Credit debate, with Steve Sachs on one side and Steve Sanders on the other side. The Full Faith and Credit Clause is like the right to travel: an aspect on the Constitution on which there are few actual experts, but on which many people will suddenly profess expertise. I have no clue what the answer is here.\n\nInstead, fourth, I want to turn to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Now, the bill did not invoke Congress's enforcement powers. The bill is expressly couched in terms of the Full Faith & Credit Clause. But could Congress have relied on Section 5 here? The analysis is a bit involved. Walk with me.\n\nI agree with Ilya that the bill would be valid with regard to interracial marriage. Here, Congress could claim that it is enforcing Loving v. Virginia --and to be on the safe side, the Equal Protection component of that case, as Dobbs cast doubt on the substantive due process component. But the bill also refers to denying recognition on the \"basis of the sex,\" not on the \"basis of sexual orientation.\" Hello Bostock . According to Justice Gorsuch, as well as Chief Justice Roberts, it is impossible to discriminate against a person on the basis of sexual orientation without also discriminating against that person on the basis of sex. Now, Bostock was not a constitutional ruling. Here, Justice Gorsuch was interpreting a statute based on decades of non-textualist precedents by Justice Brennan and his ilk.\n\nIt is possible that Gorsuch and the Chief Justice would view the Equal Protection Clause in the same fashion as Title VII. If so, Justice O'Connor's Equal Protection in Lawrence v. Texas would be correct, albeit for very different reasons. Indeed, all discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and presumably gender identity, would be subject to the same heightened intermediate scrutiny employed in United States v. Virginia . To date, the Court has not gone along with that analysis. And I'm not sure that a text-and-history analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment could bear such a conclusion. But that argument is viable.\n\nFifth, is the Respect for Marriage Act an intrusion on federalism? Or, stated differently, is it a \"proper\" exercise of federal power? I'll take Windsor as the starting point of the analysis. Think way, way back to 2013 when we still cared what Justice Kennedy thought. (Those were confusing times.) The Windsor decision explained that the Defense of Marriage Act was infected by unconstitutional animus (remember animus!?). And those who enacted the bill sought to deny dignity (remember dignity?!) to gay and lesbian couples. Here, Justice Kennedy invoked the line of cases that stretched from Romer to Cleburne to Moreno (remember Moreno !?). That dignity-denying-animus violated the Equal Protection component of the Fifth Amendment, or something like that. The specifics were never very important to Justice Kennedy. (Randy and I removed Windsor from the 4th edition of the casebook, and the 2nd edition of 100 Cases, as its vitality is quite low.)\n\nBack to the Future. The Respect for Marriage Act would (under the Kennedy guise) not be infected by unconstitutional animus. Rather, the bill would preserve the dignity afforded by marriage licenses for same-sex couples. Thus, I do not see any animus-problems here. But there are real federalism issues at play. Still, the bill critically does not require states to issue the licenses, it only concerns recognition.\n\nMy thoughts here, as always, are tentative.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Among the data collected is \"race.\"\n\nLet's see if you can figure out what the rule was before 1989. If a child had an Asian father and and a black mother, the child was tabulated as being Asian. So let's say a child had a white father and a black mother. Well, the rule must be it goes by the father's race, right? Wrong.\n\nUntil 1989, it did go by the father's race, but only if both parents were not white. If one parent was white and the other non-white, the child was tabulated by the race of the non-white parent. I can't think of any good reason for this rule other than the racist assumption that the product of interracial marriage may not be deemed white, but is automatically a member of his non-white parent's group.\n\nSince 1989, the rule has been that a baby's race is tabulated according to the mother's race, regardless of the father's race. This information is retained by the government, but modern birth certificates do not list the child's race. A proposal to do so was shot down a while back, primarily on the theory that the parents may tell authorities that their child is race \"X\", but as an adult the child might choose to identify otherwise.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "No, Tennessee Has Not Banned Interracial or Same-Sex Marriage\n\nThe state's law was amended to allow officiants to refuse to perform a marriage ceremony.\n\nSeveral viral social media posts claim that Tennessee has banned same-sex and interracial marriages.\n\n\"Tennessee just passed a bill banning same sex marriage and interracial marriages. Hope you're proud of yourselves MAGA women and white women who couldn't be bothered,\" reads one Threads post . \"Here goes the United States into a Christo-fascist Taliban abyss.\"\n\nA similar post trended this week on Reddit. \"The TN house just passed a bill designed to start a ban on same sex and inter-racial marriages,\" it reads.\n\nThe claim is false. Earlier this year, Tennessee lawmakers passed legislation that allows individuals to decline to perform marriage ceremonies, but it does not ban same-sex or interracial marriage. Existing Supreme Court precedent protects the right to same-sex and interracial marriage nationwide, and in 2022 President Joe Biden signed a bill codifying the right to same-sex marriage into federal law.\n\nIn February 2024, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signed House Bill 878, which amended a section of the Tennessee legal code specifying who can legally perform a marriage ceremony in the state. The bill added a single sentence to the section: \"A person shall not be required to solemnize a marriage.\" Under the updated language, no individual-including religious officials, state judges, and county clerks-can be forced to administer a marriage against their will. The bill does not explicitly address same-sex marriage, however, the clause allows officials to refuse to perform a marriage for any reason, including religious objections.\n\nWhile the updated Tennessee law would allow a public or religious official to refuse to personally participate in a marriage ceremony for any reason, states cannot universally deny the right to marry to same-sex or interracial couples. The court ruled in the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia that restrictions on interracial marriage violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\nIn 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects marriage as a fundamental liberty, including the right to same-sex marriage. In December 2022, President Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act , which further engrained broad protections for same-sex and interracial marriage into federal law.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Why I Changed My Mind About Law and Marriage, Again\n\nWalking through my flip, flop, flip on one of the toughest issues of our time.\n\nOne of the most important obligations of my job is transparency. It's not my job to be right all the time. After all, who can be? But it is important to explain not just what I believe and why, but also why I change my mind. When a person I respect changes political parties, I want to know why. When a person changes their mind on, say, the wisdom and righteousness of the Iraq War, I want to know why.\n\nAnd so I've tried to explain when I change my views as well. Sometimes-when the political and cultural winds shift enough-I'll also feel obligated to explain why I haven't changed. For example, it's now a virtual article of faith on both right and left that the Iraq War was wrong. I strongly disagree. I continue to believe the war was just and right, and I've tried to explain why .\n\nWhere have I changed? To take a few notable examples, I definitely changed my views of Donald Trump. I used to believe I could support him-that he was the worst Republican in the primary, but still worthy of my vote. But that was wrong . I changed my mind in 2016 and never looked back.\n\nI used to be far more trusting of the police and far less willing to credit critiques of cops. I grew up in the \"law and order\" tradition of the Republican Party, and it took me a long time before I could see what was plain to countless Americans who experience the criminal justice system up close: Racism and improper pro-police biases are far more prevalent in American law and culture than I wanted to believe .\n\nOne of the most viral pieces I've ever written chronicled my own journey on race issues more broadly , one that was deeply personal and painful, full of shame and regret. In that piece, I asked readers to \"be better than me.\" Don't wait for racism to touch your own family before you believe the testimony of your American brothers and sisters.\n\nAnd that brings me to another topic-my flip, flop, and flip back again on civil marriage. I emphasize the word civil because my view on the religious nature of marriage has not changed. It is a lifelong covenant between a man and a woman, sealed before God, and breakable only on the limited conditions God has outlined in his Word.\n\nBut declaring that religious belief is not the same thing as declaring civil law. Outside of the most hard-core integralists or dominionists, there is broad and wise consensus that importing divine standards whole cloth into civil law can be a recipe for division, oppression, and ultimate harm to the church itself. Our nation possesses an Establishment Clause for a reason.\n\nThus, we often have to wrestle with a series of difficult questions. When should we import our religious values into civil law, and how should we choose between competing religious and moral values when deciding that law? Even prior to same-sex marriage, the law governing civil marriage differed substantially from my religious beliefs. No-fault divorce, for example, is a standard far more permissive than my faith requires.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, here's my trajectory. First, in 2004, shortly after the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court legalized gay marriage in that state, I wrote one of my first-ever op-eds. I was a lawyer in private practice in Lexington, Kentucky, and put a piece in our local newspaper, the Lexington Herald-Leader . I can't seem to find the whole thing online, but here was a key paragraph:\n\nFor those who believe gay marriage is morally wrong for Biblical or other religious reasons, this decision changes nothing. Churches can still speak out against sexual immorality and can still choose not to perform gay weddings. The gay couple down the street in no way makes our own straight marriage more difficult or challenging, nor can any decision of any court of law change the definition of marriage in the eyes of God.\n\nMy reasoning tracked my lifelong lifelong civil libertarian beliefs. In a diverse, pluralistic republic, granting the same rights to others that we'd like to exercise ourselves should be the default posture of public advocacy and public policy. It's why, for example, I fiercely supported the rights to free speech and free association even in the face of deep and profound disagreements. I applied that same reasoning to civil marriage.\n\nBut then I changed course-in part because I became concerned that the movement for same-sex marriage would be ultimately ruinous for religious liberty. And I had real reasons to be concerned. To take just one example, at the Obergefell oral argument Justice Samuel Alito and President Obama's solicitor general Donald B. Verilli Jr. had the following exchange:\n\nAlito: Well, in the Bob Jones case, the Court held that a college was not entitled to tax-exempt status if it opposed interracial marriage or interracial dating. So would the same apply to a university or a college if it opposed same­-sex marriage?\n\nVerrilli: You know, I-I don't  think I can answer that question without knowing more specifics, but it's certainly going to be an issue. I don't deny that. I don't deny that, Justice Alito. It is-it is going to be an issue.\n\nIn 2004, I argued, \"For those who believe gay marriage is morally wrong for Biblical or other religious reasons, this decision changes nothing.\" By 2015 , I had reason to fear this statement was seriously wrong. I had reason to believe that Christian believers who shared my views of marriage would be treated as the equivalent of white supremacists. The very existence of our religious schools and institutions was at stake.\n\nIn other words, as I wrote on Friday in The Atlantic , when someone asked, \"What does my marriage have to do with your life?\" there was now a response: \"Changing the law could strip me of my religious freedom. It could destroy the school where I educate my kids, and it could damage the institutions that represent and advance my core values and deepest beliefs.\"\n\nSo I wanted to square the circle. I wanted gay couples to enjoy marriage-equivalent legal protections but without changing the legal definition of marriage. I wanted gay couples to enjoy the legally protected right to build a life together without creating a legal superstructure that ripped apart religious freedoms that are indispensable to the health of the republic and to the flourishing of countless millions of American lives.\n\nThen came Obergefell v. Hodges . In that decision it was clear that Justice Anthony Kennedy was trying to square the same circle as well. My eyebrows raised at this key passage:\n\nFinally, it must be emphasized that religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned. The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered. The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other reasons. In turn, those who believe allowing same-sex marriage is proper or indeed essential, whether as a matter of religious conviction or secular belief, may engage those who disagree with their view in an open and searching debate.\n\nGood words , I thought. We'll see if they survive the test of time .\n\nIn the years since Obergefell , three things have become quite clear. First, it's plain that there are progressive Americans who most assuredly do not believe there are good faith objections to same-sex marriage, even on religious grounds. They view any objection to same-sex marriage as inherently and purely bigoted, and want the law and culture to punish orthodox Christians for upholding the teachings of their churches.\n\nThe examples are legion, and they've led to multiple confrontations at the Supreme Court. In Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission , a Christian baker faced state sanction for refusing to design a custom cake for a same-sex wedding.\n\nIn Fulton v. City of Philadelphia , the city refused to contract with Catholic Social Services (CSS) because it would not certify same-sex couples as foster parents. (No same-sex couples had sought certification through CSS, and same-sex couples could get certified through other agencies.)\n\nIn 303 Creative v. Elenis , the state of Colorado asserts that a public accommodations law can be used to compel a web designer to use her artistic talents to design websites for same-sex marriages. Oral arguments in that case are set for December 5. (I filed an amicus brief in the case arguing in favor of the graphic designer's right to be protected from compelled speech.)\n\nWe also can't forget that the Democratic Party has advanced a version of its Equality Act that specifically took aim at religious freedom by stating that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \"cannot provide a basis\" for challenging the \"application or enforcement\" of the law.\n\nBut this brings us to a second reality that's emerged since Obergefell . Even as attacks on religious liberty escalated, the legal response was stronger still. Constitutional protections for religious freedom are more robust than they were in 2015. Masterpiece Cakeshop won its case 7-2. Catholic Social Services won its case against Philadelphia 9-0. The current version of the Equality Act can't make it past a Senate filibuster. And while we can't yet know the outcome of 303 Creative , most court observers would be surprised (perhaps even shocked) if the Christian web designer lost.\n\nMoving beyond the direct conflicts between religious liberty and LGBT rights, the record for religious freedom since Obergefell is extraordinary. The Court has expanded the autonomy of religious organizations to hire and fire employees. It has protected churches time and again from discriminatory regulations (including discriminatory COVID regulations), and it has expanded the ability of religious institutions to receive state funds.\n\nIn other words, since Obergefell , both LGBT Americans and people who uphold orthodox Christian teachings on marriage enjoy expanded individual and institutional liberty. That doesn't mean there aren't issues left to resolve-and it certainly doesn't mean that parts of the left aren't keen to reverse religious liberty's legal advance-but the bottom line is that the legal environment post- Obergefell is far better than I dared to hope in June 2015 when the case was decided.\n\nThen there's the third key factor. Millions of Americans have formed families and live their lives in deep reliance on Obergefell being good law. It would be profoundly disruptive and unjust to rip out the legal superstructure around which they've ordered their lives. One senses the Supreme Court feels the same way. In fact, in his majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Whole Women's Health , Justice Alito went out of his way to state that the court's decision reversing Roe did not undermine Obergefell (and a number of similar 14th Amendment precedents) \"in any way.\"\n\nSo here I am in 2022 trying to square the same circle that I was trying to square in 2004 and in 2015. I want Americans of different faiths and no faith at all to be able to live together, work together, form families, and live with peace, security, and dignity. I don't want my gay friends and neighbors to live in fear that the law might tear their families apart.\n\nI also don't want the law to treat me as a threat. I don't want the law to discriminate against those Americans who sincerely hold different views of sexual morality, sexuality, and marriage and organize their lives and their institutions accordingly. I want aggressive secular culture warriors to stand down, and if they choose not to, then I want the law to block their efforts to roll back the First Amendment.\n\nThat's why I wrote Friday in The Atlantic in support of the Senate's version of the Respect for Marriage Act . Not because I'm backing down one inch from Christian orthodoxy, but rather because it represents the best compromise I've seen yet that protects the rights and dignity of all Americans.\n\nI agree with University of Virginia professor Douglas Laycock. The act contains \" important protections \" for religious liberty, including \"an explicit statement by Congress that 'diverse beliefs about the role of gender in marriage'-including the belief that marriage is between a man and woman rather than between persons of the same sex-'are held by reasonable and sincere people based on decent and honorable philosophical premises' and that such beliefs 'are due proper respect.'\"\n\nOther provisions provide protections for the tax exemptions for religious organizations, hold that religious organizations don't have to participate in the solemnization of same-sex marriages, and specifically reject the approach of the Equality Act, which sought to undermine the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThe act doesn't provide complete protection for religious freedom, but it's an advance. At the same time, it provides a legal backstop for LGBT families in the unlikely event the Supreme Court overturns Obergefell . It holds that marriages recognized in one jurisdiction are entitled to \"full faith and credit\" in other American jurisdictions on the basis of \"sex, race, ethnicity, and national origin.\"\n\nThe Senate bill passed cloture last week, with the support of 50 Democrats and 12 Republicans. A final vote is expected soon. I don't expect the vote to end America's cultural and legal conflict over religious freedom, gay rights, and religious orthodoxy.\n\nIn fact, the struggle over American pluralism never truly ends, and people of good will can draw different lines in different places. But after almost 20 years of thought, debate, elections, and litigation, we just might be inching closer to protecting all sides of our cultural divide-even when they disagree about the most profound matters of family and faith.\n\nAnother thing ...\n\nMany readers may remember that my wife Nancy and I last year published the results of a months-long investigation into Kanakuk Kamps in Missouri, the location of a dreadful Christian sexual abuse scandal. Since that first report, we've published a number of additional reports, and Nancy has done heroic work documenting decades of abuse (and cover-ups) at the camp.\n\nOn Friday there was a significant new development. A victim of abuse at the camp sued Kanakuk claiming that it induced him to sign a settlement agreement and nondisclosure agreement through lies and deception. You can read the tweet and tweet thread below for the details. The Christianity Today report I link in the tweet is excellent and comprehensive. Please give it a read:\n\nPlease read this excellent, comprehensive report by @kateshellnutt about a new lawsuit filed against Kanakuk Kamps. A survivor of sex abuse his challenging his settlement agreement claiming fraud-He says the camp lied to gain his agreement: /1 https://t.co/HvkUbJKxkp\n\n- David French (@DavidAFrench) November 18, 2022\n\nOne more thing ...\n\nWhy am I always talking about the most contentious subjects? Perhaps one week I'll dedicate my writing and podcasting to the most uncontroversial of subjects. Perhaps one week will just be \"puppy week,\" and I'll share my love for dogs. But that's not this week, and this week I'm writing about same-sex marriage, reporting about the latest developments in a horrific abuse scandal, and podcasting about immigration .\n\nCurtis and I hosted Eric Costanzo, a Southern Baptist pastor in Tulsa, to talk about refugees, asylum seekers, and how the church talks about immigrants. Eric was fantastic. I think you'll enjoy his thoughts .\n\nOne last thing ...\n\nThis is just a great, great song. It's a profoundly humble statement of our utter dependence on God's love and grace.

      "text": "One-Armed Shadowboxing\n\nIn making everything about race, the left is fighting only the enemies it wants to fight. And it's losing.\n\nDear Reader (Including those of you who found Madison Cawthorn's transformation into comedic soft-porn character so gradual you didn't even notice),\n\nSo I've spent the week talking about abortion, and frankly I'm exhausted. Discussing such an emotionally radioactive issue can be exhausting. So let's take a break from that and talk about race instead.\n\nIn Rocky II , Mickey comes up with a strategy to beat Apollo Creed in their rematch: Rocky should fight right-handed. The strategy has three advantages to it. First, it'll surprise Creed because Rocky is a southpaw. Second, changing his stance will help protect Rocky's bad eye. And third, they had to come up with something to make the movie different from the first one.\n\nSo Rocky trains with his left arm tied at his side, to build up his right arm.\n\nAnd with that, I have introduced this week's Official G-File Outdated Pop Culture Metaphor®-tune in next week to learn how the video game in The Last Starfighter is like the Gutenberg Bible.\n\nIn Wednesday's \"news\"letter , I wrote about the Roe leak and abortion. Again, don't worry, I'm done with that for now. But while writing that, I came across an interesting statistic. Last September, American support for interracial marriage hit an all-time high. Ninety-four percent of Americans approve not merely of interracial marriage, but specifically of marriages between white people and black people.\n\nI'm not sure it's necessary for my purposes, but I'm happy to concede that the \"real\" number might be a bit lower. Polling on such questions is always open to \" social desirability bias \"-people say what they think they're supposed to say. But even if there's some of that at work-and there probably is-that too is a good thing . In 1958, when Gallup first asked the question, only 4 percent of Americans said they approved of interracial marriage. I'm sure some of those people were lying, too. In other words, what is considered socially acceptable to say-even to a stranger on a phone-has moved massively against racism.\n\nRacial progress, a good news story.\n\nAs I've written many times, this is hardly the only data point about how America has become less racist since the 1964 Civil Rights Act. For starters, we had a two-term black president and currently have a black vice president. In 1965, there were no black senators or governors and only five black members of the House of Representatives. In 2021, there were 57 black members of the House of Representatives, a statistically proportionate number to the black population (13 percent). State legislatures are somewhat below that benchmark-about 9 percent in 2015-but even so, there are hundreds of them, most notably in the Old South. Georgia has 66, Mississippi 51, South Carolina 44, North Carolina 37, Alabama 31, etc.\n\n\"In 1942,\" Marian Tupy, who runs the invaluable HumanProgress.org, wrote a few years ago, \"some 68 percent of white Americans surveyed thought that blacks and whites should go to separate schools . By 1995, only 4 percent held that view. In 1958, 45 percent of white Americans would 'maybe' or 'definitely' move if a black family moved in next door. By 1997, that fell to 2 percent.\" In surveys asking whether you would be opposed to a neighbor of a different race moving next door, America doesn't come out as the least racist country in the world, but we do far better than many countries. We beat Germany and France (3.7 percent), Spain (12), Italy (11.7), Mexico (11.4), Russia (14.7), China (18), Turkey (41.21!), and even Finland (6.8).\n\nAnyway, you get the point. Or maybe you don't. So let me be clear: We have not solved the problems with racism in this country. Even though black Americans themselves report that race relations have improved , they also report that they run into significant levels of racism in their lives, and as a general proposition, I believe them. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is real, and even though we can have good faith disagreements about the scope and nature of that legacy or how to redress it, it would be foolish and to some significant extent immoral to pretend racism is no longer a real problem. My only point is that America has made monumental and, to a significant degree, historically unprecedented racial progress.\n\nThe unified field theory of racism.\n\nAnd yet, for many progressives, racism and \"white supremacy\" have become if not bigger problems then at least more powerful and exhaustive explanations for America's woes. Put another way, as racism has shrunk in American life and politics, racism as an explanatory theory for American life and politics has expanded.\n\nEddie Glaude Jr., a very nice and smart guy, is a fixture on MSNBC and a go-to explainer of America's racial crisis. Glaude is a tenured professor at Princeton University, a once thoroughly racist institution, particularly under Woodrow Wilson's leadership. Indeed, not only did Wilson refuse to admit African American students, he adopted a policy of airbrushing past black students from the historical alumni record. Anyway, here's what he writes in his book Begin Again about James Baldwin. In the wake of Donald Trump's election, he writes:\n\nI asked myself: What do you do when you have lost faith in the place you call home ? That wasn't quite the right way to put it. I never really had faith in the United States in the strongest sense of the word. I hoped that one day white people here would finally leave behind the belief that they mattered more. But what do you do when this glimmer of hope fades, and you are left with the belief that white people will never change-that the country, no matter what we do, will remain basically the same?\n\nNow, it's always fraught and a little uncomfortable to say that a black person is wrong in their understanding of race in America. It's a deeply personal and highly subjective matter, loaded with opportunities for both insensitivity and accusations of insensitivity. But as an empirical matter, Glaude is simply wrong. As an objective matter, even when accounting for lamentable backsliding, various controversies, and enduring problems, the idea that \"white people\" have not changed and \"will never change\" is simply untrue. Unless, of course, all notions of objective measurement are meaningless.\n\nAnd that's basically what some people argue. Ibram X. Kendi has gotten rich explaining to guilty white liberals that they are on the numinous side of the Manichean struggle against white supremacy .\n\nThis version of America is very close to a religious dogma among many progressive elites. Melanie D'Arrigo, a (white) congressional candidate in New York, said yesterday that Republicans \"are only out to reinforce systems of white supremacy at the expense of everyone else. This is the lens through which every Republican statement should be viewed.\"\n\n\"Every Republican statement\"-really? Support for military aid to Ukraine should be viewed through the lens of reinforcing white supremacy?\n\n\"[O]ne must acknowledge that the GOP is not a political party anymore,\" the Washington Post 's Jen Rubin recently insisted . \"It is a movement dedicated to imposing White Christian nationalism.\"\n\nNow, I hold no brief for the GOP these days. In fact, I agree that the GOP has become immorally accommodationist of racist and racially insensitive arguments. Paul Gosar and his ilk should have no place in the party of Lincoln. Speaking to neo-Nazi groups the way Marjorie Taylor Greene did should be a far more egregious litmus test violation than, say, voting for a bipartisan infrastructure bill, never mind supporting the impeachment of Donald Trump.\n\nI think Nick Confessore's epic length investigation of Tucker Carlson was something of a missed opportunity and I have any number of substantive and editorial quibbles with it. But on its own terms, I think Confessore makes a persuasive or at least plausible case that Carlson makes racist appeals and that Fox News has made a series of indefensible choices for the sake of ratings and profit. I can think of no high-minded reason why Rupert Murdoch would put VDARE's Peter Brimelow (who just called for the Supreme Court to undo Brown v. Board of Education next) on his payroll. There are colorable defenses of Carlson that can be made, even if I'm not inclined to make them. But the refusal or inability of so many on the right to even concede that Confessore revealed some troubling facts is a sign of the tribal wagon-circling that passes for argumentation on the right.\n\nBut the simple fact remains that white supremacy and racism aren't the monolithic, all-explanatory problems the left thinks they are.\n\nWhich brings me back to Rocky's southpaw switcheroo.\n\nAs both a thought experiment and a messaging strategy, Democrats would be well-advised to pretend that racism has nothing to do with their current problems. The left wing-or left arm, for the purposes of this analogy-wants to fight only racism. They should tie that arm down and build up their right arm to punch on other fronts.\n\nConsider perhaps the biggest driver of Democrats' electoral challenges: the massive migration of rural and white working class voters into the Republican fold. Trump's election in 2016 was a direct result of this trend. And it was Trump's election that drove Glaude and countless others to despair that America was irredeemably and enduringly racist.\n\nI'm not saying that race didn't play a part in that. I'm saying focusing on race to the exclusion of all other factors is not in their interests, in no small part because it's not the most important part of the story. Again, rural and working-class whites-the former the backbone of the FDR coalition-have been moving into the GOP fold even as they have become less racist . When only 4 percent of Americans approved of racial intermarriage, those voters were overwhelmingly Democrats. It's fine-and probably right-that race plays some role in their migration. But the role race plays in American life has both shrunk and changed. And telling people they don't understand their own motives and that their \"real\" motives are evil is a really stupid form of politics.\n\nThe Democrats' story about racism does nothing to reverse this trend and a good deal to accelerate it. Because when you tell people who don't believe-for good reason-that they are racist and that their opposition to Democratic policies is racist, you not only insult those voters, you shout in their faces that you don't understand them as they understand themselves.\n\nFor instance, I get the ubiquitous argument that \" abortion restrictions are racist \" because they disproportionately fall on poor black women in certain states the hardest. But show me someone who thinks your average committed pro-lifer is motivated by racism and I'll show you someone who doesn't know a lot of pro-lifers (or racists). I mean, do you think so many pro-life activists make the argument that abortion is racist because they consciously believe they are racist themselves?\n\nIf you think, a la Jen Rubin, that opposition to introducing trans ideology and gender theory to school kids has a lot to do with white supremacy, you will have no chance of talking constructively to parents who oppose such things, particularly non-white parents who share such concerns.\n\nThis is even true about explicitly racial matters. Opponents of critical race theory-or what passes for it-are a diverse lot. But the reason why most non-ideological parents don't like this stuff isn't because they're racists, it's because they don't like being told they are racists . That's particularly true of the Biden-Youngkin voters that should be gettable for Democrats. I know of only two groups that believe in the maximalist 1619 Project thesis that this country was founded by, and for, white racists: hyper-woke progressives and stone-cold alt-right racists. Everyone else is troubled by the argument to one extent or another, either because it's factually flawed or because it's a grotesque insult to this country. I'm amazed this counts for an edgy political insight: Voters don't like to be told they live in a bad country.\n\nNow, I'm not saying Democrats should give up caring about racism-no one should. But the America-is-racist Unified Field Theory persuades almost no one not already in the fold. Both rhetorically and when translated into policy, it tends to repulse more than it attracts, which is why Asian Americans and Hispanics are starting to follow (though admittedly in smaller numbers) the white working class out of the Democratic Party. It also comes across as self-righteous. When Beto O'Rourke goes on stemwinders about how racist white America is, he comes across as the secular equivalent of a holier-than-thou preacher. When MSNBC panels take turns congratulating themselves for opposing the racism of anti-mask protesters, they sound like the self-exiled woke kids at their own table in the high school cafeteria.\n\nIf Democrats could build up their right arms punching at problems or arguments that aren't all about \"white supremacy,\" they'd have a fighting chance. And by protecting their bad eye, they'd save it for opportunities to see the racial problems that matter. But too many would rather fight the enemies they want to fight and see the problems they want to see, because that makes them feel better about themselves.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nCanine update: Yesterday, Pippa rolled in goose poop, three times.

The effulgent foulness of the fowl poop-or the effulgent fowlness of the foul poop-was its own reward. She did think the bath she got was entirely unfair. Meanwhile, Zoë was a very good girl the other day, even if discretion probably outweighed valor.

He got away from his owner and charged the Fair Jessica while she was walking the dogs. Jess knows how to deal with dogs and stood her ground. And amazingly, Zoë didn't take the bait. She too stood her ground, but didn't engage. Again, Zoë is a bit of a kiss up, kick down type. If it had been a chihuahua, her response might have been less dignified. Still, we're proud of her.

      "text": "Explaining the Right's Debate Over the Senate's Gay Marriage Bill\n\nReligious freedom advocates don't all agree on the Respect for Marriage Act.\n\nDoes the Senate's gay marriage bill safeguard religious liberty or erode it? Different people give different answers, even if they're both Republicans and both firmly support religious freedom.\n\nA dozen Republican senators voted with Democrats last week to move forward with the bill-aimed at protecting same-sex and interracial marriages-after winning language explicitly addressing religious liberty and religious institutions. An earlier version of the bill passed the House over the summer, with 47 Republicans joining Democrats in supporting it. Now that the Senate bill has new provisions, the House will have to consider it again. The Senate is set to continue debate on the measure when the chamber returns from Thanksgiving recess, and it is poised to pass.\n\nSupporters of the bill say its religious freedom provisions are robust. But another set of Republican senators and conservative organizations have slammed it, calling for a farther-reaching amendment blocking the government from discriminating against people based on their beliefs about marriage.\n\nLimited Approach\n\nMuch of the disagreement centers on how far the bill should go. On all fronts, the bill is limited, which is why some progressives have criticized it too.\n\nThe legislation doesn't create a national right to gay marriage. Rather, it requires state governments to recognize marriages legally performed in other states. The bill came about because of speculation that the Supreme Court-after dismantling Roe v. Wade this year-could unwind the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision that made gay marriage legal nationwide. In such a scenario, the Respect for Marriage Act would require states to recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in other states or at a time when it was legal, even if they were to ban performing same-sex marriages within their own jurisdictions. Despite the limited scope, proponents argue the bill is essential to protect existing gay marriages and give those couples peace of mind.\n\n\"It's better for Congress to clarify these issues than for federal judges to make these decisions,\" Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt said of his support for the bill last week.\n\nThe bill's religious liberty provisions are also limited: They don't affirmatively and comprehensively ban the government from ever revoking an organization's tax-exempt status based on beliefs about marriage, for example, but they do ban the government from using this bill to do that. That section of the bill also prohibits the government from using the legislation to deny or alter educational funding, grants, contracts, loans, scholarships, licenses, certification, accreditation, and other benefits based on an organization or person's beliefs about marriage.\n\n\"The bill is really very narrow,\" said Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who is backing the measure. \"It's constitutional and it does not infringe on state sovereignty.\"\n\nSen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, has introduced a more sweeping amendment to ban discriminatory behavior by the government based on marriage views. Senate leadership hasn't granted a vote on his measure yet, though he is still pressing for one.\n\nWhere the Respect for Marriage Act says nothing within it can be used to take away or alter government and tax benefits from a person or entity, Lee's amendment would forbid the federal government from taking away or changing those benefits due to beliefs about marriage.\n\n\"His amendment covers all federal action and all federal law; the bill just covers this federal law,\" Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Virginia and a prominent scholar of religious freedom law, told The Dispatch .\n\nLee's changes \"are not necessarily bad ideas,\" Laycock added, but because they weren't hammered out with Democrats he thinks they'll be difficult to pass. Laycock supports the negotiated bipartisan version of the bill, arguing with other scholars in a letter last week that the religious liberty safeguards in the legislation are \"meaningful and important even if not comprehensive.\"\n\nReasonable and Sincere People\n\nOne of the most important new sections of the bill, according to Laycock and other religious liberty experts, is a statement that diverse beliefs about the role of gender in marriage are held by \"reasonable and sincere people based on decent and honorable philosophical premises.\"\n\nIt further affirms that \"such people and their diverse beliefs are due proper respect.\"\n\nLaycock and the religious freedom scholars wrote in their letter that this statement from Congress \"would be a legitimate, and powerful, statement of national policy-one favoring respect for (among other things) religious organizations that adhere to traditional views of marriage.\"\n\nIt also distinguishes belief in male-female marriage from opposition to interracial marriage. This, supporters say, is an important line to draw. Some groups have argued past judicial decisions to revoke tax-exempt status for religious institutions based on racial discrimination should apply to organizations holding a traditional view of same-sex marriage. The religious scholars said this bill would weaken those attempts.\n\nStill, other religious liberty proponents argue the language is too vague to be meaningful. Roger Severino of the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote that the bill does not include any terms specific to male-female marriage, but it does actively affirm that interracial and same-sex couples \"deserve to have the dignity, stability, and ongoing protection that marriage affords to families and children.\" That language, he argued, may be potent in courts in the opposite direction.\n\nOther experts take issue with the phrasing but suggest the language still marks a step forward for religious institutions. Matthew Lee Anderson, an assistant research professor of ethics and theology at Baylor University, wrote Monday that the language is \"vague, to be sure.\" But, he added, it \"also lends statutory support to the notion that disagreement about what constitutes marriage is reasonable and so not reducible to animus.\"\n\nFor that reason, among others, Anderson said he is \"not persuaded that it is the disaster conservatives have claimed it is.\"\n\nThe Solemnization or Celebration of Marriage\n\nThe bill also specifies that churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, religious schools, and a whole host of other nonprofit religious organizations and agencies \"shall not be required to provide services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges for the solemnization or celebration of a marriage.\"\n\nConservative groups have criticized this: That the government is not able to compel churches to perform marriages should be obvious under the Constitution. They would like this section to go further, not just addressing the solemnization or celebration of marriage but also recognition of it.\n\nOpponents broadly fear that the bill could spark \"more litigation against those institutions and individuals trying to live according to their sincerely held religious beliefs and moral convictions,\" as Lee wrote in a letter to his colleagues.\n\nConcerns about litigation are real: Religious schools , nonprofits , business owners , and others have faced costly litigation related to their beliefs about marriage and sexuality for years. Many of those are based on state-level anti-discrimination laws, though, outside the scope of the Senate bill as written.\n\nThe group of religious freedom scholars who wrote the letter last week in support of the bill pointed out that this section bars \"any civil claim or cause of action\" based on a religious organization's refusal to participate in the solemnization or celebration of a marriage.\n\n\"Although courts might provide such protection under the First Amendment, this provision makes the right more secure and avoids lengthy constitutional litigation,\" they wrote.\n\nMy colleague David French summarized that the bill's \"provisions, taken together, roughly preserve the legal status quo.\"\n\nIt does not purport to address every religious-liberty issue related to same-sex marriage. For example, it doesn't address the conflict between the First Amendment rights of for-profit businesses and state nondiscrimination laws-a conflict that SCOTUS will partially address this very term when it decides 303 Creative v. Elenis , a case involving a clash between a Christian web designer's free-speech rights and Colorado's public-accommodations statute. The question is simple: Whether \"applying a public-accommodation law to compel an artist to speak or stay silent violates the free speech clause of the First Amendment.\"\n\nWhile some conservative critiques of the legislation focus on the substance of the text, like those who worry the language is too vague, others say it fails to address all current and potential future threats to religious liberty.\n\nStill others, like the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, share those concerns but ultimately oppose the bill primarily because of their beliefs about traditional marriage.\n\nAnd some seem open to the idea that it is a net-gain for religious freedom.\n\n\"The bill does not give comprehensive protections because it isn't trying to solve every religious liberty question in one go,\" Anderson, the Baylor professor, wrote . \"It also allows other legislative solutions to those questions.\"\n\n\"These are not the only religious liberty protections we need, at all,\" he added. \"Yet the gains here are not negligible, either, and what is lost is-well, the answer to that depends on how realistic it is to think that Obergefell will be overturned within the next 10 years.\"\n\nHaley Wilt is a former associate editor for The Dispatch.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Calvinball in Ohio\n\nChanging the rules on abortion in the middle of the game.\n\nImagine what this country might look like if amendments to the U.S. Constitution could be enacted by simple majorities in national referendums.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education desegregating public schools might have been overturned. Support for that ruling after it was issued was stronger than you might assume given the era, but at one point in the mid-1950s the public was split as narrowly as 52-44 in favor . A referendum held at the time to undo the decision could have gone either way.\n\nInterracial marriage has been constitutionally protected since 1967, when the court decided Loving v. Virginia , but public support for the practice lagged for years afterward. As recently as the mid-1990s-no typo-a minority of Americans approved of marriages between whites and blacks. Loving too might have been undone at the polls.\n\nIn 1942, the court infamously upheld the federal government's power to intern Japanese-Americans during wartime. But had that decision gone the other way, it's a cinch that a national referendum would have overruled it. A poll taken that year found 59 percent of Americans supported forcibly removing U.S. citizens of Japanese descent from the West Coast.\n\nThe point of the Constitution is to limit the power of the federal government to encroach on the rights of the states and the power of all levels of government to encroach on the rights of the individual. Allowing the document to be amended directly by the voters who elected those governments in the first place would be perverse, permitting the sort of tyranny of the majority that it otherwise aims to prevent by cutting out the legislative middleman.\n\nIf we're going to change the supreme law of the land, the document that safeguards the fundamental balance of power between state and citizen, we should logically require an unusually strong consensus to do so. A simple majority that would make the Constitution subject to popular whim is too meager. A supermajority, whether of the public or their elected representatives, is more sensible. Which is how we ended up with Article V .\n\nAll of this is a preface to saying that, in the abstract, I like what Republicans in Ohio are up to in seeking to raise the threshold for amending their state constitution . Currently that document can be amended by a 50-percent-plus-one vote in a ballot initiative, inviting a tyrannical majority to alter the supreme law of the state at the polls. Republican legislators want to raise the bar to 60 percent, more in line with the U.S. Constitution's supermajority requirements.\n\nBut they're not doing so for abstract philosophical beliefs about majority rule and minority rights. They have a particular outcome in mind. And in a post-liberal GOP, outcomes are everything.\n\nSome Ohio Republicans have been coy about their sudden interest in raising the threshold for constitutional amendments. But not all.\n\nThe push began last November , a few months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade . Ohio had a six-week abortion ban on the books but Republicans could look across the border and guess what might soon become of that law. On Election Night, amid sweeping Democratic victories in Michigan, voters there passed a referendum amending their own constitution in order to guarantee abortion rights. The share voting in favor was 56.7 percent .\n\nPro-choicers prevailed in other abortion-related ballot initiatives that day, including in red states. In Kentucky, their side won with 52.4 percent . But the most noteworthy referendum on the subject happened a few months earlier, in Kansas, when pro-choicers prevailed with 59 percent .\n\nGo figure that Republicans in Ohio digested those results and concluded that, after 111 years of allowing simple majorities to pass new constitutional amendments at the polls, a 60 percent majority was suddenly necessary.\n\nA few Republican legislators have gamely insisted that the timing is a coincidence and that the higher threshold is needed to prevent out-of-state \"special interests\" from meddling with Ohio's constitution. But state Rep. Brian Stewart was candid in an email he sent to colleagues last December endorsing the 60 percent threshold: \"After decades of Republicans' work to make Ohio a pro-life state, the Left intends to write abortion on demand into Ohio's Constitution. If they succeed, all the work we accomplished by multiple Republican majorities will be undone.\"\n\nHe's not wrong. Pro-choicers in Ohio are in fact gathering signatures for a new ballot referendum this November that would amend the state constitution to permit abortion until a fetus is viable, at around 24 weeks.\n\nTo head them off at the pass, the GOP's own 60 percent amendment would go before voters for approval in August. The Ohio legislature had recently voted to eliminate special elections in August , a sleepy time of year with low turnout traditionally, but they're making a special exception for this one at a cost of some $20 million . They have no choice: Obviously, the 60 percent amendment needs to be enacted before the pro-choice amendment is voted on in November.\n\nIf everything works out for Republicans, the 60 percent amendment might pass with 50.1 percent of the vote while the subsequent pro-choice amendment will fail with 59.9 percent.\n\nThe 60 percent amendment wouldn't just raise the threshold for constitutional amendments. It would require activists seeking to add an issue to the ballot to gather a certain number of signatures in all 88 of Ohio's counties instead of 44, as the law currently provides, which will make things tricky for progressives in deep-red rural areas. That signature provision won't take effect until 2024 for legal reasons but it's still tied to the long-term effort to keep abortion out of the state constitution. In case pro-choicers fall short in November, their next bite of the apple to enact abortion rights via a ballot initiative will be more difficult procedurally.\n\nA bill supporting the 60 percent amendment passed the state Senate last week , with the House soon to take it up. On Wednesday Ohio's Republican secretary of state warned house legislators of \"consequences\" from their voters if they fail to pass it.\n\nThey're playing Calvinball, in short, tweaking the rules of the amendment process after it's already begun to avert a policy outcome on abortion that they abhor.\n\nHow should someone who supports supermajority requirements for constitutional amendments in principle feel about this?\n\nDespite the fact that I share the goal of reducing abortions, I don't feel great. The move reeks of an attempt by the state representatives to protect their personal policy preferences from being overridden by ... their own constituents. Voters.\n\nRepresentatives are supposed to represent the will of the people. The effort underway in Ohio to raise the threshold for constitutional amendments is a product of Republican legislators deducing what a majority of the electorate wants on abortion and, instead of conceiving of ways to deliver it, contriving procedural roadblocks to thwart it. That's not the way democracy is supposed to work.\n\nThe reason we typically require a supermajority to change a constitution is to make it harder for the majority, through its elected representatives, to target the rights of a vulnerable minority. In this case, though, the majority is pitted against its own representatives. They can't convince the state legislature to enact a policy that a (likely) majority of residents prefers, so they're taking matters into their own hands-only to find their own leaders trying to foil them by upending an amendment process that's been good law for more than 100 years.\n\n\"Well, then the people should vote them out of office,\" you might say, and I agree. If a representative won't do what his constituents desire, the solution is to oust him in the next election. That's how democracies ensure accountability.\n\nBut in an age of ruthless gerrymandering on both sides, accountability is easier said than done. Ohio broke 53-45 for Trump in the last presidential election yet the state Senate tilts 26-7 Republican and the state House leans 65-32 toward the GOP. The party enjoys supermajority power in both chambers. The only way to enact policies that a majority of voters support but which Republican lawmakers oppose is, therefore, a ballot initiative.\n\nAnd soon that might carry a supermajority requirement too.\n\nPut simply, the GOP's ballot initiative seems designed less to protect minority rights than to facilitate minority rule in a hotly contested policy dispute which the minority is losing.\n\n\"They're trying to protect the rights of the unborn minority,\" you might counter, and I sympathize. But that's the point of this debate, isn't it? To decide which rights the unborn should have?\n\nThe end of Roe was supposed to return that question to the democratic process. Instead of embracing that process and offering their own amendment to enshrine unborn rights, Republicans in Ohio have undertaken to make the democratic process a bit less democratic than it was before.\n\nRelatedly, there's an important distinction between amending the U.S. Constitution and what's happening in Ohio. The federal Constitution has an unusual degree of public legitimacy partly for procedural reasons: Its components were ratified by a supermajority of the states, reflecting a strong national consensus supporting each. We don't allow simple legislative statutes to override that strong consensus. If you want to change the U.S. Constitution, you need to generate an unusually strong consensus of your own.\n\nIn Ohio, the six-week ban on abortion that passed there in 2019 was a simple statute , requiring only a bare majority to pass. Ohio voters now seeking to override that law via ballot initiative aren't trying to substitute a weak consensus for a particularly strong one. They're attempting to substitute one expression of simple majority will for another.\n\nAnd in an America where federal constitutional rights protect citizens from state governments, there's less to fear from a state majority abusing its power to amend its state constitution via simple majority. If Ohioans passed an amendment with 50.1 percent of the vote banning all religions but Christianity, that amendment would be headed down the toilet in federal court before close of business that day.\n\nAll in all, how I feel about what Ohio Republicans are doing is how I felt about Ron DeSantis seeking to eliminate Disney's special improvement district in Florida. In the abstract I can see sound policy reasons to do it. It's weird, frankly, for a private corporation to enact its own land-use rules through a government cut-out that it controls.\n\nBut DeSantis didn't try to quash Disney's district as a matter of good government. He did it to retaliate against the company for expressing a political opinion he disliked. Intentions matter. To endorse a defensible policy enacted for indefensible reasons is to encourage further indefensible reasoning.\n\nIf Ohio's state legislature gets away with playing Calvinball on abortion, on which other subjects might legislatures begin playing Calvinball?\n\nThis, by the way, is what it looks like when a party gives up on persuasion.\n\nIn a state as red as Ohio has become, it's not unthinkable that pro-lifers might win a ballot initiative on whether the constitution should protect abortion rights. Republicans there could have focused their energy not on raising procedural thresholds for amendments but on convincing undecided voters to support the six-week ban. Even if they failed, having the simple-majority threshold for amendments in place would allow them to repeal any newly enacted abortion rights in some future amendment after they've persuaded a majority of Ohioans to ban the practice.\n\nThey don't think they can win, though. For all the populist blather about the \"silent majority,\" the right's unspoken fear that they've lost the country and will continue to lose ground over time explains much Republican behavior in the Trump era. They lost the presidential popular vote twice, lost the House in 2018, lost the Senate in 2020, lost a bunch of winnable statewide races in 2022, and lost a series of state referendums on abortion post- Roe . A party that still believed itself capable of persuading voters wouldn't be en route to renominating the guy who led them through those many disasters. A party that believes its only option is to brute-force its way to power, whether by ginning up base turnout on Election Day to overwhelm swing voters or through less legitimate means if it can't, might understandably triple down on Trump.\n\nThat logic is at work in Ohio. \"Republicans had three choices: make the case to voters that tough abortion restrictions were worthwhile; compromise and bend to public opinion; or change the rules so that their opponents could not protect abortion rights against the will of a legislature that wants to ban the procedure,\" wrote liberal commentator Jamelle Bouie of the GOP's dilemma there. There was never a doubt which one they would choose. When democracy and right-wing policy preferences conflict, democracy must give.\n\nThe irony is that it'll probably all be for naught. Democracy will win in the end.\n\nAfter all, it's not a given that Republicans' 60 percent amendment will pass in August. Other red states have offered ballot initiatives recently to raise the threshold for amending their constitutions to 60 percent and have failed spectacularly. Last November a similar referendum went down in flames in Arkansas to the tune of 41-59. In June 2022, a referendum in South Dakota that would have required 60 percent to pass any ballot measure involving tax hikes crashed at a 33-67 margin.\n\nVoters aren't eager to limit their own power to make the law that governs them, it turns out. Once pro-choicers in Ohio put the word out about the stakes of the August special election, I imagine they'll be heavily favored to win it.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans will endure more bad national press about the unusual lengths to which they're willing to go to restrict abortion. After two of the so-called \"Tennessee 3\" were expelled from the House in that state, I and others wondered if such heavy-handed tactics would backfire on the GOP by inflaming opponents while doing little to advance Republican interests. 'The irony,\" I wrote , citing a piece by Greg Sargent, \"is that this series of red-state power plays has a national audience, and the more alienated that audience becomes, the more insecure Republicans will feel about their hold on power. We've ended up in a sort of vicious circle in which, rather than moderate in ways that would grow their coalition, the GOP continues to crack down ever harder on liberals to protect its cultural turf in ways that are ultimately self-destructive.\"\n\nIsn't that how the Ohio saga is apt to end? The 60 percent amendment will fail in August, the pro-choice amendment will pass in November, and Republicans will have put the rest of the country on notice that they're not above trying to play constitutional Calvinball to keep their unpopular abortion laws in place. Do they end up gaining or losing votes on balance nationally when they smoke clears?\n\nFrankly, I think the GOP should seize the opportunity provided by ballot initiatives on abortion. The party's been left in an impossible position politically in needing to somehow appease the ardent pro-lifers in their base and the pro-choice swing voters who decide general elections. They're tying themselves in knots trying to do both. The only way to arrive at an outcome that's viewed with maximum legitimacy by the public on an issue as morally contentious as abortion is to let the public itself decide it at the polls. Republicans should do all they can to organize pro-life voters to defeat pro-choice ballot measures, but if they end up failing, they can at least get pro-life activists to back off by reminding them that the people have spoken.\n\nThere's no broadly satisfying resolution to a debate this bitter in a country as divided as ours. Democracy is the best we can do.\n\nNick Catoggio is a staff writer at The Dispatch and is based in Texas.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nThis undated illustration provided by Tinder/Emojination shows new variations of interracial emoji couples. In the world of emojis, interracial couples had virtually no options in terms of skin tone. But the emoji gods, otherwise known as the Unicode Consortium, recently rectified that, approving 71 new variations. Using six skin tones already available for one-person emojis, vendors such as Apple, Google and Microsoft will now be able to offer couples of color. Additions are expected later this year. (Tinder/Emojination via AP)\n\nIn 1664, Maryland passed the first British colonial law banning marriage between whites and slaves. An 1883 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that state prohibitions on interracial marriage don't violate the Fourteenth Amendment held for more than 80 years.\n\nWhile such impediments to marriage were dismantled over time, there are still hurdles, however small, to overcome. Here, in 2019, interracial couples have a small victory to celebrate: The approval of 71 new variations of emoji for couples of color.\n\nCapping a yearlong project by, of all people, the folks at the swipe-right dating app Tinder and tech activist group Emojination, the emoji gods (known as the Unicode Consortium) recently approved the additions in characters technically referred to as people \"holding hands.\" A new \"gender-inclusive\" couple emoji was also approved among 230 new characters.\n\nUntil now, emoji of two or more people on various platforms and devices have been available only in the default yellow. While the Unicode Consortium, where Google, Microsoft and Apple have voting seats and Lee is vice-chair of the emoji subcommittee, signed off on the skin-tone additions, user companies will decide for themselves starting later this year whether to add them and how they will look.\n\nJenny Campbell, the chief marketing officer for Tinder, isn't worried about distribution after the company mounted a campaign and petition drive in support of the technical proposal it submitted to Unicode.\n\n\"Ultimately, we wanted to get the interracial emoji couple on people's keyboards not only for equality, but also to spread acceptance for all couples no matter what their race,\" she told The Associated Press on Thursday. \"Our users are craving a way to express themselves visually and see themselves reflected in our everyday tech language.\"\n\nSo are lots of other emoji enthusiasts of color left in the wings for years. More than 50,000 people signed Tinder's online petition at Change.org.\n\n\"Unicode is taking user demand for more skin tones across emoji very seriously,\" said Lee, the co-founder of the grassroots Emojination. \"The additional of skin tones, gender variations, hijab and hair styles are part of users around the world demanding to see themselves represented on the emoji keyboard. Diverse couples and families are part of that.\"\n\nWhile facial features and hair textures are yet to be determined by some vendors, Tinder said the use of six existing skin tones already available for one-person emoji and various others is a step in the right direction at a time when the text- and chat-friendly characters remain a readily accessible way for the world to express itself. The lack of color options in couples, the company said, felt like a slight.\n\n\"Even as our social behaviors have evolved and interracial dating and marriage has become more prevalent, visual representation of these relationships in technology has lagged far behind,\" Campbell said.\n\nEmoji of single people of color and same-sex couples were added in the last several years, but not in mixed-tone combinations. In real life, the rate of interracial marriage has increased over the years, especially since the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia that struck down all anti-miscegenation laws remaining in 16 states. But such marriages remain a small portion of marriages overall.\n\nTinder is taking credit for its industry in pushing interracial dating along, citing data that indicates couples who meet online are more likely to be interracial than those who don't.\n\n\"We know that equal forms of representation are important to our users,\" Campbell said, \"and important to us.\"\n\nSkin tones for limited use were added to the Unicode Standard for emoji in 2015. More representation of women in 2016, some \"gender-inclusive\" people in 2017 and hair color options last year.\n\nAlso approved this year: A waffle, a much-requested white heart, a guide dog and people in wheelchairs.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nAmerica's top court convened on Tuesday to take up the delicate and divisive issue of gay marriage, with the nine Supreme Court justices set to consider the legality of a California ballot initiative that limits marriage to opposite-sex couples.\n\nAs sign-carrying demonstrators from both sides gathered peacefully in front of the Supreme Court building on a brisk morning in Washington, the first of two days of oral arguments on the issue got under way inside.\n\nOn Wednesday, the court will consider the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which limits the definition of marriage to opposite-sex couples. Rulings in both cases are expected by the end of June.\n\nIn what were scheduled to be about three hours of deliberations with lawyers over the two days, the justices will have their say on what gay activists see as a civil rights issue reminiscent of famous Supreme Court cases of the past, including Loving v. Virginia, a 1967 case in which the court invalidated bans on interracial marriage.\n\nThe cases come before the high court at a time when more states have legalized gay marriage. Last year three more - Maryland, Maine and Washington - did so, bringing the total to nine plus the District of Columbia.\n\n\"Never before in our history has a major civil rights issue landed on the doorstep of the Supreme Court with this wave of public support,\" said Theodore Boutrous, a lawyer for opponents of the California initiative, which is known as Proposition 8.\n\nStrong opposition to gay marriage still exists, however, both among Republicans in Congress and in many states. A total of 30 states, including California, have constitutional amendments that ban gay marriage. Nine states, including California, recognize civil unions or domestic partnerships among same-sex couples. Outside the courthouse, about 1,000 protesters waved signs, danced to music and traded arguments. The crowd was largely pro-gay marriage, though a large group of opponents was expected to arrive later in the morning.\n\nWashington resident Matthew Brawn-Dexter said he and his husband, a federal employee, want the same benefits as heterosexual couples. \"Civil rights are civil rights,\" said Brawn-Dexter, 28. \"Separate but equal is not equality.\"\n\nA few feet away, Arthur Boisse, 70, said he drove overnight from Rhode Island to protest against gay marriage.\n\n\"Marriage should be between a man and a woman,\" he said. \"That's what it says in the Bible. If the homosexual lifestyle becomes predominant, it's a step backwards.\"\n\nAmong others who planned to demonstrate outside was Chief Justice John Roberts' cousin Jean Podrasky, a lesbian from California who would like to marry her partner.\n\nSome experts said that, with the issue unsettled in the states, a majority of the justices might be disinclined to make sweeping pronouncements as the democratic process plays out.\n\nMULTIPLE OPTIONS\n\nThere are various ways they could do that in June - when a ruling is expected - as the Proposition 8 case presents multiple options for the justices.\n\nFor instance, they could proclaim that gay marriage bans are constitutionally unsound. They could uphold Proposition 8 as a law with a legitimate purpose approved by a majority of voters in California. They could also plot a middle path by striking down the law without making broad pronouncements about whether gay marriage bans in other states should be struck down.\n\nAnother way the court could rule later this year might be viewed as an anticlimax of sorts: The justices could simply decide that they cannot rule on the merits because of the procedural complexities that brought the case to the high court.\n\nThe state of California declined to support Proposition 8 when the plaintiffs filed suit in 2009 in a federal District Court in San Francisco, meaning there was no party defending the law until its proponents entered the case. The federal judge struck the law down, a ruling that was upheld by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nA Supreme Court decision concluding that the law's backers do not have legal standing to defend the law would wipe out the Appeals Court decision, but leave the District Court decision that struck down Proposition 8 on the books.\n\nThe way the justices rule could depend in large part on the likely swing voter, Justice Anthony Kennedy. Although a conservative appointed by President Ronald Reagan, Kennedy has in the past authored two opinions that expanded gay rights.\n\nLawyers representing two same-sex couples in California who want to marry are hoping the justices will go big and are making the most sweeping arguments.\n\nThe counsel for Kris Perry and Sandy Stier and Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo will argue that under the U.S. Constitution's equal protection guarantee, there is a fundamental right for people to marry someone of the same sex. Perry, who has raised four children with her partner Stier, was hopeful and optimistic.\n\n\"We have been waiting for a long time to get married,\" she said last week. \"We are very excited to have the end in sight.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nFOX Business host Larry Kudlow gives his take on the Supreme Court's decision to overturn abortion case Roe v. Wade on 'Kudlow.'\n\nSo, the Supremes finally went ahead and overturned Roe v. Wade , with a five-justice majority and affirmed states' authority to regulate abortion.\n\nAbortions will still be available in numerous states and the Alito text expressly ruled out overturning other precedents such as contraception, interracial marriage and same-sex marriage.\n\nThough I greatly admire Justice Clarence Thomas, I think he is completely wrong about overturning these particular precedents, stare decisis, and there's no indication that this court will go in that direction.\n\nAs I have in the past, I will put my cards face-up on the table: I am a strong pro-life advocate of the rights of the unborn. I appreciate that many disagree with me, and I respect their views, but that is what I believe.\n\nSTOCK MARKET NEWS: DOW JUMPS 825+POINTS, COMPANIES REACT TO ROE V. WADE\n\nBrian Kilmeade, Katie Pavlich and Guy Benson reflect on the Supreme Court's decision to overturn abortion case Roe v. Wade on 'Kudlow.'\n\nPeople talk about the woman's right to choose. I understand the importance of that, but who will speak for the unborn? They are God's creation. I am one of the many, many millions of people who will defend their right to live. We have lost 63.5 million human beings since 1973, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nIn recent years, the volume of abortions has come down significantly per year, but it's lately hovering over 600,000. That's an awful number. Lives lost. God's creatures. Of course, the issue of abortion is a moral issue, one of the most important we ever face in policy discussions, but it is also an economic issue.\n\nI repeat what I said a couple months ago, when Roe first emerged from the leaked memo. Think of what a boon and a blessing it would've been to the economy if all those babies had come to term and grown up to avail themselves of America's great opportunities.\n\nCountries with rising populations are countries with rapid growth rates, provided they practice free market principles. To me, every baby lost is tragic. I'm not ashamed to say it. It's my viewpoint, I respect disagreements.\n\nI want to give a hat-tip to President Trump for his successful court nominees: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nOf course, Joe Biden is attacking the Dobbs decision, arguing that the health and life of women are now at risk, arguing for an extreme bill floating around Congress called the \"Women's Health Protection Act,\" which among its many tragedies would even allow for late-term, partial birth abortions - a horrid thought.\n\nSUPREME COURT OVERTURNS ROE V. WADE IN LANDMARK ABORTION DECISION\n\nTennessee Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn reacts to the historic Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade on 'Making Money with Charles Payne.'\n\nFortunately, while the majority of Americans regard themselves as pro-choice , 55% according to the Gallup poll, inside that number, 67% support first trimester abortions, but only 36% second trimester and only 20% third trimester.\n\nThat is why the far-left position of unrestricted abortions represented by Mr. Biden and his allies will never be popular throughout the country. Biden is trying to scare people that the world is coming to an end. It's a familiar tactic of his, but it won't work. When the dust clears, folks will see this court decision changes very little, if anything.\n\nExcept, it upholds the originalist constitutional view and re-empowers state legislatures and the voters who elected them. This is how it should be.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden delivers a speech during the state dinner hosted by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol at the National Museum of Korea, in Seoul, South Korea, Saturday, May 21, 2022. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man, Pool / AP Newsroom)\n\nMr. Biden may seek to use Roe as a distraction from what is really America's number one political issue, and that is record inflation and gas prices. I believe this will not be a Roe election. This will be an inflation election and Mr. Biden's self-inflicted mistakes, his war against fossil fuels, his war against business in general, his free spending and borrowing policies, all of which were the true causes of inflation - not Vladimir Putin, or other villains like oil companies.\n\nThese self-inflicted mistakes will cost Mr. Biden and his progressive friends that have taken over the Democratic Party enormously at the polls in November when the cavalry comes.\n\nThis article is adapted from Larry Kudlow's opening commentary on the June 24, 2022, edition of \"Kudlow.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Jerry Nadler, D-NY, on July 18 and passed by a vote of 267-157 the next day. The U.S. Senate took it up on Nov. 14.\n\nIt would provide \"statutory authority for same-sex and interracial marriages\" and repeal several provisions of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The 1996 law received bipartisan support including from then U.S. Sen. Joe Biden and U.S. Rep. Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and from Democratic President Bill Clinton, who signed it.\n\nWhen a constitutional amendment was proposed to ban same-sex marriage in 2006, Sen. Biden told Meet the Press' Tim Russert, \"I can't believe the American people can't see through this. We already have a law, the Defense of Marriage Act ... where I voted and others ... that marriage is between a man and a woman and states must respect that. ... Why do we need a constitutional amendment? Marriage is between a man and a woman.\"\n\nSixteen years later, President Biden now supports replacing DOMA provisions, which \"define, for purposes of federal law, marriage as between a man and a woman and spouse as a person of the opposite sex,\" with ROMA provisions \"that recognize any marriage that is valid under state law,\" according to the bill summary.\n\nThe summary also notes that the Supreme Court ruled three marriage-related laws as unconstitutional: DOMA (U.S. v. Windsor, 2013) and state laws banning same-sex marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015) and interracial marriage (Loving v. Virginia 1967).\n\nThe bill would also allow \"the Department of Justice to bring a civil action and establishes a private right of action for violations,\" its summary states.\n\nWhen filing a cloture motion on a substitute amendment on Nov. 17, now Senate Majority Leader Schumer said the Senate would vote on ROMA when it returned on Monday after Thanksgiving. He said, \"Let me be clear,\" passing it \"is not a matter of if but only when.\" He also thanked his colleagues from both sides of the aisle \"who led this bill.\"\n\nTwelve Republicans voted with Democrats to allow it to move forward, eliminating a filibuster threat: Sens. Roy Blunt, Richard Burr, Shelley Capito, Susan Collins, Cynthia Lummis, Rob Portman, Mitt Romney, Dan Sullivan, Thom Tillis, Joni Ernst, Lisa Murkowski, and Todd Young.\n\nAfter their vote, Biden said, \"Love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person they love,\" adding their vote made \"the United States one step closer to protecting that right in law.\"\n\nSchumer also said he had \"zero doubt\" the bill \"will soon be law of the land.\"\n\nBut multiple groups disagree, arguing it's unconstitutional for the same reasons the Supreme Court struck down DOMA. Because the court already ruled Congress doesn't have the constitutional authority to define marriage under Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution, and because ROMA is nearly identical to DOMA, they argue it will also likely be struck down.\n\nIn a letter to Congress, the nonprofit religious freedom organization Liberty Counsel argues the court ruled in Windsor, \"DOMA, because of its reach and extent, departs from this history and tradition of reliance on state law to define marriage.\" It also ruled, \"[b]y history and tradition the definition and regulation of marriage . . . has been treated as being within the authority and realm of the separate States.\"\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver, said, \"The Constitution cannot be said to prohibit the exercise of power to define marriage in one manner yet authorize the opposite definition of that same unconstitutional exercise of power. If Windsor noted that Congress lacked authority in this realm, then it necessarily lacks the power here.\"\n\nWhile a bipartisan amendment was introduced claiming to protect religious liberty, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, argues it really doesn't.\n\n\"Religious Americans will be subject to potentially ruinous litigation, while the tax-exempt status of certain charitable organizations, educational institutions, and non-profits will be threatened. My amendment would have shored up these vulnerabilities,\" he said.\n\nHeritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said, \"Conservatives are deeply disappointed by the betrayal of Senate Republicans to protect Americans' religious freedom and won't soon forget the votes of the 12 Republican senators who cast aside an essential right in a bill that will weaponize the federal government against believers of nearly every major religion.\"\n\nGregory Baylor, senior counsel with Alliance for Defending Freedom, also said the law is \"unnecessary and could have a disastrous effect on religious freedom. While proponents of the bill claim that it simply codifies the 2015 Obergefell decision, in reality it is an intentional attack on the religious freedom of millions of Americans with sincerely held beliefs about marriage.\"\n\nIt also \"threatens religious freedom and the institution of marriage\" by codifying a \"false definition of marriage in the American legal fabric,\" ADF argues. It also \"opens the door to federal recognition of polygamous relationships, jeopardizes the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that exercise their belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, and endangers faith-based social-service organizations by threatening litigation and liability risk if they follow their views on marriage when working with the government.\""

The lawsuit is preemptive.\n\nTwo of the court's conservative members, Associate Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh, both Trump appointees, were skeptical of Colorado's arguments against Smith's suit.\n\nBarrett, per The Hill, posed a hypothetical scenario to the state in which a business chose to exclusively promote same-sex marriages.\n\n\"Let's just say that [The New York Times] for Gay Pride Month decides that it's going to run - to promote and recognize same sex marriage - only same sex marriage announcements, turns away heterosexual announcements, not because it disparages or disagrees with opposite-sex unions but because it's trying to promote something else...

Or about people who don't believe that disabled people should get married? Where's the line? ...I choose to serve whom I want,\" she said. \"If I disagree with their personal characteristics like race, or disability, I can choose not to sell to those people this website because it's my speech?\"\n\nSmith attorney Kristen Waggoner retorted that Supreme Court precedent asked the justices to consider whether her client was \"otherwise serving those in the protected class in expressing other messages.\" Smith is willing to serve gay customers outside of providing them with online wedding services.\n\nThe case is 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis. A decision from the court is expected by this summer."

Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Thom Tillis (R-NC) collaborated on the bill, which proponents believe will pass the Senate when it comes up for a vote on Wednesday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) had agreed in September to postpone the vote until after the Nov. 8 midterm elections.\n\n\"Through bipartisan collaboration, we've crafted commonsense language to confirm that this legislation fully respects and protects Americans' religious liberties and diverse beliefs, while leaving intact the core mission of the legislation to protect marriage equality,\" the group said in a statement late Monday.\n\n\"The Respect for Marriage Act is a needed step to provide millions of loving couples in same-sex and interracial marriages the certainty that they will continue to enjoy the freedoms, rights, and responsibilities afforded to all other marriages,\" the senators said in a statement.\n\nWhile the bill would require the federal government to recognize legal marriages, it does not require states to issue marriage licenses that are contrary to their state laws.\n\nSign up to get the best stories straight to your inbox.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nThat means that should the Supreme Court overturn Obergefell v.

Virginia, which made interracial marriage a constitutional right, states would not be required to marry same-sex or interracial couples.\n\nHowever, states would still be required to recognize any marriage legally granted by another state, according to the bill.\n\nSome Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, have called the legislation superfluous because the Supreme Court decisions in Obergefell and Loving already made the right to same-sex and interracial marriage the law of the land.\n\nRubio went so far as to tell a CNN reporter that the House passing its version of the Respect for Marriage Act on July 19 was a \"stupid waste of time.\"\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court's June decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, which overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion led some legislators to believe codifying the right to same-sex and interracial marriage was necessary in case challenges to Obergefell or Loving come before the court.\n\nThat urge was strengthened by Justice Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion in Dobbs that suggested the Supreme Court \"should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedent, including ... Obergefell.\"\n\n\"Because any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous' ... we have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents,\" he wrote.\n\nSubstantive due process is a legal principle that allows courts to establish certain fundamental rights not enumerated in the Constitution without congressional approval.\n\nDemocrats had promised to also codify the right to abortion if Americans voted to preserve their majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nHowever, President Biden said Monday he didn't \"think there's enough votes to codify\" the right to abortion following the midterm election results, \"unless something happens unusual in the House.\""

      "text": "Dear Abby: I feel disconnected from my son after his interracial marriage\n\nDEAR ABBY: I've always been close to my children, but now that they are adults, it seems I'm losing my connection with one of them. He married a girl of a different race, and while that doesn't bother me, I have a strong hunch she's the reason he has distanced himself from not only me, but also the rest of the family.\n\nWhen I recently shared with him that I felt his wife is a bit of a busybody and had overstepped some boundaries, he told me he no longer wants a relationship with me. I don't think I said anything so bad that he'd totally remove himself from my or our lives, but I'm no longer going to try to force him to be a part of this family.\n\nAfter I blocked his wife from social media (because she doesn't interact, but stalks and then reports back to him), he has blocked me. I'm usually good at dealing with conflict, but he's steadily drawing further and further away. I love all my children, but he needs to realize it's not ALL about his wife - we're his family, too. I really need help with this one. - ADULTS' MOM\n\nDEAR ADULTS' MOM: Leaving your daughter-in-law and her race out of this for a moment, the situation you have described is one that sometimes happens when a son gets married. When that happens, the young man's allegiance switches from mom and family to his wife.\n\nSign up to get the best stories straight to your inbox.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nYour daughter-in-law reviewing your posts and discussing them with your son isn't outrageous, particularly if he isn't viewing them himself. Were you posting something she found hurtful or offensive? If the answer is no, you may have to accept that, for whatever reason, your son has decided to move in a different direction. If the answer is yes, offer an apology and see if it's possible to bury the hatchet.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband of 30 years and I are in-house separated. We sleep in separate bedrooms. I want a divorce, but he refuses to leave, even though he could afford another house. Our grown son came to visit recently and was staying in our camper in our backyard. The camper is next to our swimming pool.\n\nLast Sunday, I looked out the kitchen window and saw my husband standing in the pool naked. Our son was in the camper at the time and came out to see his father standing there. When I asked my husband why he did this, my question was met with rage and yelling that he didn't want to get his bathing suit wet. Don't you think this is the behavior of a depraved person? - FINISHED IN FLORIDA\n\nDEAR FINISHED: For your son to have seen his father naked in the swimming pool isn't what is cause for concern. More alarming is that a change in his usual behavior may indicate a mental or emotional problem and calls for a medical evaluation. (He might be more open to it if your son suggests it.)\n\nPlease consult an attorney and ask what would be involved if you were to go through with that divorce. Get those answers now, before a crisis happens.\n\nDEAR READERS: On this day that celebrates love, I want you to know how much I value the relationship I have with you.

The bill must now go back to the House for final approval, which is likely to come next week.\n\nPresident Biden intends to sign the law, which was pitched by a bipartisan group of legislators after the Supreme Court in June overturned Roe v. Wade and returned abortion policy to the states, some of which all but banned the procedure.\n\nThe Supreme Court scrapped state bans on interracial marriage in the 1967 case Loving v. Virginia and legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in the 2015 case Obergefell v. Hodges - but the abortion ruling stoked concern that those precedents were at risk.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), the only openly gay or lesbian person currently serving in the Senate, said, \"I want to recognize the millions of same-sex and interracial couples who have truly made this moment possible by living their true selves and changing the hearts and minds of people around this country.\"\n\nThe legislation passed after the Senate defeated three amendments intended to bolster legal protections for people who disapprove of same-sex relationships.\n\nSen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) argued that religious Americans already have sufficient defences.\n\n\"This protects everything from the tax status of religious nonprofits to the accreditation of religious schools to the contracts between faith-based adoption providers and the government from being attacked using this bill,\" Portman said.\n\n\"It ensures that nonprofit religious organizations - including churches, mosques, synagogues, religious schools, and others - can not be required to provide facilities, goods or services for marriage ceremonies or celebrations against their will.\"\n\nBut Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) predicted that \"countless numbers of lawsuits\" will soon be filed \"testing out the new limits of this law.\"\n\nWhile the bill requires states to recognize any marriage legally granted by another state, it still leaves room for states to choose whether they want to issue same-sex or interracial marriage licenses should the Supreme Court precedent be overturned.\n\nThe bill does not allow federal recognition of polygamous marriage and does not require nonprofit religious organizations to provide any ceremonial marriage services.\n\nSome Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, criticized the legislation as superfluous because the US already has the right to same-sex and interracial marriage in law through the Supreme Court decisions.\n\nRubio went so far as to tell a CNN reporter on July 19 that the House passing its version of the Respect for Marriage Act was a \"stupid waste of time.\"\n\nSenate Republicans who voted for the bill included Portman, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Todd Young of Indiana.\n\nOne Democrat, Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia, missed the vote, as did Republicans Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion in the June 24 ruling that rescinded federal abortion rights - Dobbs v. Jackson County Women's Heath - accused dissenting justices of attempting to \"stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil\" other rulings that legalized the use of contraceptives, as well as gay and interracial marriage.\n\nThe majority opinion said , \"to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\"\n\nHowever, one conservative justice voting in the majority, Clarence Thomas, submitted a concurring opinion that said \"in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.\" Thomas, who currently is in an interracial marriage to conservative activist Ginni Thomas, did not call on the court to reconsider the Loving ruling.\n\nSame-sex marriage currently has overwhelming public support - with 71% of US adults being in favor, according to a Gallup survey released in June. However, there are significant regional differences and support for the policy was considered politically toxic just a decade ago.\n\nBiden, as a senator, voted in 1996 to ban federal recognition of same-sex marriage and to allow states to reject marriage licenses from other jurisdictions. But as vice president in 2012, Biden abandoned his opposition in what was seen as a possible gaffe that forced then-President Barack Obama to also drop his own \"evolving\" stance and support the practice.\n\nMassachusetts in 2004 became the first state to allow same-sex marriage and the Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in Obergefell ended a protracted struggle that included state and federal lawsuits, voter initiatives and state legislation. Former President Donald Trump, a Republican, was \"the first president to start as president approving of gay marriage,\" his adviser Kellyanne Conway said in 2019 .\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "House passes bill protecting gay and interracial marriage, sends to Biden for signature\n\nWASHINGTON - The House of Representatives gave final approval Thursday to a bill that reaffirms the legality of same-sex and interracial marriage - sending it to President Biden for his expected signature.\n\nThe legislation passed 258-169 with 39 House Republicans voting in favor, fewer than in a prior vote in July. The Senate passed the bill 61-36 in late November.\n\nSame-sex and interracial marriage were legalized nationwide by the Supreme Court - in 2015 and 1967, respectively - and the bill was drafted due to concern that the court could reverse itself after it ended federal abortion rights in June.\n\nThere wasn't a full House debate Tuesday, but outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought to frame the moment by saying that \"since the Supreme Court's monstrous decision overturning Roe v. Wade, right-wing forces have set their sights on this basic personal freedom.\"\n\n\"The Respect for Marriage Act will help prevent right-wing extremists from upending the lives of loving couples, traumatizing kids across the country and turning back the clock on hard-won progress,\" Pelosi said, adding, \"it tears the bigoted, unconstitutional Defense of Marriage off the books for good.\"\n\nIn 1996, then-Senator Joe Biden backed the Defense of Marriage Act banning federal recognition of relationships between gays and lesbians. That law let states reject marriage licenses issued in other states and denied healthcare, tax, immigration and inheritance rights to same-sex couples. It cleared the Senate 85-14 and the House 342-67 , with Pelosi among those voting against it, before it was signed by President Bill Clinton.\n\nIn 2012, as vice president, Biden abandoned his opposition to same-sex marriage as public support for the reform grew - one year after New York joined five other states and legislatively expanded marriage rights . President Barack Obama dropped his opposition to legal recognition of same-sex marriages shortly after Biden did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGallup polling first showed majority support for same-sex marriage in 2011 and as of May, 71% of US adults said the government should recognize their validity.\n\nThe Senate passed the legislation with 12 Republicans in support, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who helped lead the charge to end the military's ban on gay and lesbian members in 2010.\n\nConservatives who opposed the bill said they anticipated a wave of lawsuits targeting religious groups and individuals.\n\nSen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) predicted that \"countless numbers of lawsuits\" would soon be filed \"testing out the new limits of this law.\"\n\nBackers of the bill insisted it would not increase the liability of people who disapprove of such unions.\n\nSen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said during the Senate debate that the bill \"protects everything from the tax status of religious nonprofits to the accreditation of religious schools to the contracts between faith-based adoption providers and the government from being attacked.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added, \"It ensures that nonprofit religious organizations - including churches, mosques, synagogues, religious schools, and others - can not be required to provide facilities, goods or services for marriage ceremonies or celebrations against their will.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court majority opinion in the June 24 ruling overturning Roe v.

Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\"\n\nA concurring opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas, however, said \"in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.\" Thomas, who currently is in an interracial marriage, did not call on the court to reconsider the 1967 ruling in Loving v. Virginia.\n\nSome Republicans who support legal same-sex marriage opposed the legislation as unnecessary.\n\n\"In a fit of hysteria triggered by one sentence in a concurring opinion by Justice Thomas, Democrats have moved to introduce a bill codifying Obergefell v. Hodges,\" Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) tweeted during full House debate in July. \"This holding is not in jeopardy. Gay marriage doesn't offend me nearly as much as offending federalism does through this legislation.\"\n\nThe final version of the legislation requires states to recognize any marriage legally granted by another state, but leaves room for states to choose whether they want to issue same-sex or interracial marriage licenses should the Supreme Court precedent be overturned.\n\nRep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), who attended his son's gay wedding in July just days after voting against the earlier version of the bill, said he would vote \"no\" again over religious liberties concerns, despite releasing a statement that he was \"very happy to welcome\" his \"new son-in-law\" into his own family.\n\n\"Individuals have the freedom and the right to choose who to grow old with in life,\" Thompson said Thursday . \"However, the bill lacks the appropriate constitutional protections for religious liberties enshrined in the First Amendment.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "What is Loving Day and how did it become a symbol for interracial couples?\n\nFifty-three years ago Friday, the Supreme Court struck down 16 state bans on interracial marriage, paving the way for black and white couples to get married in the aftermath of the vicious Jim Crow era.\n\nJune 12 is now known as Loving Day - which is a play on the last name of the plaintiffs in the landmark case - and has become a celebration of a decision that would forever change matrimony in America.\n\nThe story behind Loving Day is detailed in author Peter Wallenstein's book, \" Race, Sex, and the Freedom to Marry: Loving v. Virginia ,\" said USA Today , which added that the story was later depicted in a 2016 movie and 2011 documentary.\n\nIt all began in 1958 when Mildred Loving got pregnant and traveled with her soon-to-be husband Richard Loving to Washington D.C. to get married, Wallenstein said.\n\nSoon after they returned to their home in Caroline County, Virginia, they were roused in the middle of the night by cops who arrested them for breaking a law against interracial couples.\n\nThe Loving couple was thrown in jail on \"unlawful cohabitation\" charges and were given two options - they could either stay in jail, or leave the state for 25 years.\n\nThe Loving's chose to leave, but they didn't give up without a fight.\n\nMildred petitioned then Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who told her to enlist the American Civil Liberties Union for help.\n\nThe ACLU took the case and brought it all the way to the Supreme Court where all sitting justices ruled the case should be overturned on June 12, 1967.\n\nOver 30 years after the Loving v. Virginia landmark ruling, designer Ken Tanabe made it the subject of his graduate thesis project at Parsons School of Design, which eventually grew into Loving Day.\n\nTanabe said the holiday is now celebrated around the world and told USA Today the name isn't \"just a reference to a real couple who fought racial injustices.\"\n\n\"It also represents the love that we give to each other,\" Tanabe said.\n\nTypically, volunteers coordinate a flagship event in New York City but in 2020, at the height of Black Lives Matter movement, Tanabe said the day should be celebrated with \"a meaningful pause\" in honor of the modern fight for racial justice.\n\n\"We've been asking folks to continue that tradition of observing Loving Day in meaningful and personal ways but also by joining us in coming together in support of black lives and justice,\" Tanabe told the outlet.\n\nAmid nationwide protests against racism and police brutality after George Floyd's murder at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer , Wallenstein said the Loving case epitomizes \"the toxic residue of Jim Crow\" and how it \"continues to make its way down the streets and into people's lives.\"\n\n\"It really is quite remarkable how much can change,\" Wallenstein said.\n\n\"And it's just as remarkable how little does.\""

      "text": "Intermarriage: a real measure of race relations\n\nWill we look back on the early 2000s as the pinnacle of racial harmony in this country?\n\nIt seems an odd question, but a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found that only 40 percent of Americans think race relations in this country are good, the lowest level since 1995.\n\nCharles Blow, for one, isn't worried. The New York Times columnist looks at the figure \"optimistically.\" He writes, \"I see the result of vociferous truth-telling and justice-calling, in the face of which fairy-tale obliviousness is reduced to ashes.\"\n\nIn other words, we've spent so much time in the past year ripping the bandages off that we can finally expose our racial wounds and let them begin to air out and heal.\n\nWhat a load of malarkey.\n\nAs depressing as that poll is, it's only about Americans' perceptions. The reality is far different.\n\nThe miniscule number of blacks shot by white police officers has only declined further in recent decades. Meanwhile, our educational institutions are almost single-mindedly devoted to producing racial diversity. The KKK is not on the march.\n\nTo understand the real state of race relations in this country, consider this: In 1960, multiracial marriages were only 0.4 percent of all marriages. By 2010, that figure had jumped to 8.4 and was at 15 percent for recent newlyweds.\n\nOf all marriages by blacks in this country, 1.7 percent were to whites in 1960. Today, it's 12 percent.\n\nIn a recent New Republic article, Brookings scholar William H. Frey writes, \"Sociologists have traditionally viewed multiracial marriage as a benchmark for the ultimate stage of assimilation of a particular group into society.\n\n\"For that to occur, members of the group will have already reached other milestones . . . similar levels of education, regular interaction in the workplace and community and, especially, some level of residential integration.\"\n\nInterracial marriage is booming, so America plainly has closed in on those benchmarks. Yet you'd never know it from most media accounts of blacks and whites in this country. What gives?\n\nOur liberal elites have plainly decided it's better if we're all convinced that our country had made no progress on race since 1960, that lying just beneath the surface of every white person is a gurgling volcano of racial epithets ready to spew forth at the slightest provocation.\n\nThe current trend toward chronicling \"microaggressions\" (bits of racism so small you might not even see them as racism) is, if anything, evidence of the lack of a problem.\n\nThe first lady recently cited an incident she'd previously used as a joke - two years ago, someone at Target asked her to reach something on a high shelf - as (in her new telling) a sign of prejudice that shows she's still the victim of racism.\n\nSimilarly, the critically acclaimed poet Claudia Rankine in a new book cites this: \"The real-estate woman, who didn't fathom she could have made an appointment to show her house to you, spends much of the walk-through telling your friend, repeatedly, how comfortable she feels around her.\"\n\nAs the Times review glowingly notes, \"Rankine wants us to know that no American citizen is ever really free of race and racism. The potential to say a racist thing or think a racist thought resides in all of us like an unearthed mine in a forgotten war.\"\n\nThat may or may not be true, but dwelling upon these \"potential\" slights could reverse the racial progress we have in fact made.\n\nIn recent months, we've heard endlessly about \"the talk\" black parents must have with their sons - the one where they warn boys about the dangers police officers pose to them. Never mind that the danger to black boys is far more likely to come from their peers.\n\nWe've heard from the media, the politicians and the professoriate about how difficult it is to bring up children with dark skin in our society today because of all the injustice they face. We're bombarded with the message that white people could never possibly understand because of, well, privilege.\n\nAnd plenty of well-meaning whites have bought into all of it. On Facebook, my middle-class white friends now advertise talks with their white kids about how different their lives would be if their skin were black.\n\nAnd Jen Hatamaker, the wife of an evangelical pastor who has adopted a son from Ethiopia, told the Religion News Service: \"A couple years ago, I would've said we're moving to a post-racial society because I was so under-exposed to people of color and the issues they deal with on a daily basis.\"\n\nHer 600-strong congregation includes two or three dozen adoptive families, many interracial. But she somehow doesn't see that, in and of itself, as proof of progress. Instead, she keeps telling her son about Michael Brown: \"Every time we talk about it, there are tears, there's confusion.\"\n\nWho's really the confused one there? Even if not a single black person were shot by a cop this year, it wouldn't make a dent in the black homicide rate.\n\nBut what matters now is perception - and it may start pushing us backward. Will people considering dating, marrying or having children with people of other races start reconsidering, thanks to all this handwringing? Maybe adopting across racial lines is just a bridge too far? Being married and having children are hard enough. Why do it with someone you could never hope to understand?\n\nSounds like the kind of thing you might think in 1960."

      "text": "Why more black women should consider marrying white men\n\nTwo of the most powerful positions in the United States government will soon be held - for the first time - by black women: Kamala Harris and Ketanji Brown-Jackson. Harris, as we all know, is the vice president of the United States and Brown-Jackson could soon become a Supreme Court justice.\n\nBut Harris and Brown-Jackson also share a personal attribute that is equally noteworthy: Each has a white husband.\n\nThis fact is significant. The effects of racism have left well-educated black women with a paucity of black male partners: According to Brookings Institute data, black men are less likely than black women to have completed high school and 50 percent less likely to have attained a four-year college degree . Yet despite the shortage of suitable black partners, black women have also been the least likely of any minority group to marry outside of their race, according to data from the Pew Research Center.\n\nRather than partner with men of other races, many heterosexual black women either don't marry or marry black men with whom they are not especially well matched . And these mismatched relationships contribute to African Americans having the highest divorce rate of any racial group (in fact, black women are the only demographic to have a higher divorce rate than marriage rate).\n\nA bit more than a decade ago I published a book, \" Is Marriage for White People? \" that examined the decline in marriage across American society and especially among African-Americans, and focused in particular on the predicament of black women. The book raises the possibility that black women - like Harris and Brown-Jackson - would do well to open themselves to partnering with men who are not black. After all, black men appear to have no problem marrying out: That same Pew report revealed they are twice as likely as black women to have a non-black spouse.\n\nMy book generated considerable controversy and exposed fissures within black America. While younger people appeared more open to interracial relationships, a black woman old enough to be my mother made a point of telling me that I was \"a disgrace to my race.\"\n\nBut the most significant fissure was between black men and women. While some black women were made uncomfortable by the book, and the way it put them in the spotlight, many others embraced its message of empowerment. That was a message that not all black men wanted to hear. At one of my book talks in Washington DC, I worried a fight would break out between a young black woman who asserted her right to choose whatever type of man she wanted and an older black man who condemned such sentiments as betraying the race.\n\nOther critics, including some black women, contended that white racism precluded black women from finding non-black partners. And this convinced many black women that they cannot (or should not) partner with a non-black man, even if the alternative was remaining unpartnered or in a bad relationship. As a result, many black women feel that they should \"marry down\" before they \"marry out.\"\n\nI explained in the book why black women should not be pressured to sacrifice their own chances for happiness out of some misplaced loyalty to black men. Nor should black women feel beholden to black men under the guise of advancing the race. If the price of racial solidarity is a bad intimate relationship, then the cost is too high. Black women should not be held hostage to the struggles of black men.\n\nTrue, race can provide a basis of compatibility, but race itself cannot solely sustain a relationship. And there are many bases of compatibility other than race. Black women's increased rate of interracial marriage - from a mere three percent in 1980 to 12 percent in 2017, according to the Pew Research Center - also reflects their increasing autonomy to choose partners that best serve them. They should not have to apologize or feel guilty for doing so.\n\nThere has been little discussion in the media or culture about the white partners of prominent black women like Harris or Brown-Jackson and I hope this reflects the increasing social acceptance of such unions. If so, then black women will be able to enjoy the relationship freedom they deserve.\n\nRalph Richard Banks is the Jackson Eli Reynolds Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and Co-Founder & Faculty Director of the Stanford Center for Racial Justice .\n\nAdvertisement"

Todd Young (R-Ind.)\n\nThe vote came after a bipartisan group of senators on Monday agreed on changes to the bill that would guarantee federal recognition of same-sex and interracial marriages while protecting religious liberties.\n\nThe bill would require the federal government to recognize all marriages - regardless of a couple's race or gender - that were conducted legally under state law, but does not authorize federal recognition of polygamous marriage.\n\nIt does not, however, require states to issue marriage licenses that are contrary to their state laws and prevents nonprofit religious organizations from being required to provide any ceremonial marriage services.\n\nStill, states would still be required to recognize any marriage legally granted by another state should the bill pass.\n\nThe push to codify same-sex and interracial marriage rights comes after the Supreme Court in June overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion with its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson.\n\nSimilar to abortion, the right to same-sex marriage and interracial marriage were also made federal law through Supreme Court cases. Passing a law to protect those rights against any future Court decisions.\n\nIt remains unclear when the Senate will vote whether to pass or strike down the bill. The House passed its version of the Respect for Marriage Act on July 19.\n\nAfter Wednesday's vote, President Joe Biden urged Congress to promptly pass the bill and thanked them for sending \"a strong message that Republicans and Democrats can work together to secure the fundamental right of Americans to marry the person they love.\"\n\n\"Love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person they love,\" Biden said. \"The Respect for Marriage Act will ensure that LGBTQI+ couples and interracial couples are respected and protected equally under federal law, and provide more certainty to these families since the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs.\""

Mike Braun criticized the 1967 Supreme Court decision that legalized interracial marriage throughout the country - then quickly walked back his comments.\n\nBraun (R-Ind.) made the incendiary comments during a press conference Tuesday with reporters from his home state. Braun began by first criticizing the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which he decried as \"judicial activism.\"\n\nBraun said overturning Roe would bring the country \"back to a neutral point.\"\n\n\"This should be something where the expression of individual states are able to weigh in on these issues, through their own legislation, through their own court systems,\" he told reporters on the conference call.\n\nBraun said he would similarly support overturning the landmark case of Loving v. Virginia - a legal decision from the same era that made laws against interracial marriage unconstitutional.\n\nBraun immediately responded, \"when it comes to issues, you can't have it both ways.\"\n\n\"When you want that diversity to shine within our federal system, there are going to be rules and proceedings. They're going to be out of sync with maybe what other states would do,\" said Braun, who was elected to Senate in 2018. \"That's the beauty of the system.\"\n\nBraun, 67, said he'd support the Supreme Court leaving the issue of interracial marriage up to the states.\n\n\"You're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too. I think that's hypocritical.\"\n\nAfter receiving criticism for his statements regarding interracial marriage, Braun issued a clarifying statement to The Hill , saying he \"misunderstood the question\" and seemingly walking back the criticism.\n\n\"Let me be clear on that issue - there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race, that is not something that is even up for debate, and I condemn racism in any form, at all levels and by any states, entities, or individuals,\" Braun said.\n\nA spokesperson for Braun also confirmed to The Hill that the senator does not believe Loving v. Virginia should be overturned."

      "text": "Jim Obergefell blasts Justice Thomas for Roe ruling, omitting interracial marriage\n\nJim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the 2015 landmark Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage, blasted Justice Clarence Thomas for not including Loving v. Virginia on his list of cases that the nation's highest court should \"reconsider.\"\n\nObergefell accused Thomas of protecting himself in his ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade , in which he urged his colleagues to re-evaluate other constitutional rights - but omitted the 1967 Loving v. Virginia ruling that declared it unconstitutional to ban interracial marriage.\n\n\"It's a clear indication that if it's a case that impacts him directly, it's safe,\" Obergefell told \" CNN Newsroom\" on Sunday of Thomas, who has been in an interracial marriage with his wife, Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, since 1987.\n\n\"But if it's a case that protects other people, other people who are unlike him, then we're not very safe.\"\n\nThomas joined the 6-3 majority opinion on Friday overturning Roe v. Wade, citing the landmark abortion ruling's lack of constitutionality.\n\nIn his concurring opinion , Thomas indicated that Friday's decision should also be applied to other cases regarding gay marriage and access to birth control, since they were also decided on the legal theory of \"substantive due process\" - which refers to fundamental rights not explicitly established in the Constitution.\n\n\"In future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nIn the 1965 ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court allowed married couples to access birth control. In 2003, in Lawrence v. Texas, the court forbade states from outlawing consensual gay sex, and in 2015, Obergefell v. Hodges established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.\n\nThomas noted that Friday's decision only affected federal abortion access and not other rights, but urged his colleagues to apply the same \"Due Process Clause\" logic to the other landmark rulings.\n\n\"Because any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous,' we have a duty to 'correct the error' established in those precedents,\" he wrote.\n\nObergefell singled out Thomas for his concurring opinion, saying it \"put a target on the back\" of other constitutional rights - yet protected ones that impact the justice.\n\n\"The right to interracial marriage is only six years older than a woman's right to abortion,\"  told \"CNN Newsroom\" on Sunday. \"Half of your country lost the right to control their own body, and that should terrify everyone in this nation who believes in our ability.\n\n\"Our nation has a much longer history of denying interracial marriage. Do we want to go back to the late 18th century, the originalist who's saying we can only interpret the Constitution as of the time it was written? When that Constitution was written, 'We, the People' did not include blacks, indigenous people, it did not include women, it did not include queer people. That is not a more perfect union,\" he continued.\n\nSign up to get the best stories straight to your inbox.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\n\"We should be moving forward, not backwards,\" he added. \"And this court is taking us backwards, this extreme court is taking us backwards.\"\n\nDespite Thomas' call to reconsider the other cases, his fellow conservative justices don't appear as convinced.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito - who wrote the majority opinion - stressed Friday that the ruling should not be applied to any issue besides abortion.\n\n\"To ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right,\" he wrote.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh echoed that sentiment in another concurring opinion: \"Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Interracial Marriage and the Liberal Mind\n\n\" F irst Black Bachelorette shines in debut, but is America ready for interracial love?\" When NBC executives tweeted that question last week, what exactly did they expect the answer to be? Were they hoping for some racial unrest to boost their primetime ratings? Have they noticed Kanye West and Kim Kardashian together recently? And what year is it at Rockefeller Center anyway?\n\nFor the rest of us it's 2017, a half-century since Loving v. Virginia , the Supreme Court decision that invalidated state laws prohibiting interracial marriage. The notion that we still need to ask whether Americans are ready to accept interracial relationships seems patently absurd.\n\nLast week Pew released a poll showing that one in six newlyweds are married to someone of a different race. And it will be no surprise if the Bachelorette, Texas lawyer Rachel Lindsay, winds up with someone white or Asian or Hispanic since \"the most dramatic increases in intermarriage have occurred among black newlyweds.\" According to Pew, \"Since 1980, the share who married someone of a different race or ethnicity has more than tripled from 5% to 18%.\"\n\nDespite the obvious fact that romantic relationships between people of different races are simply a fact of life in this country, a number of articles about the study zeroed in on differences in attitudes toward interracial marriage that Pew researchers found in a survey earlier this spring. The New York Times , for instance, noted that \"Roughly half ... of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents see intermarriage as a good thing for society. For Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, less than 1 in 3 ... saw marriages between races and ethnicities as a good thing for society.\" A story on NPR also reported on this this \"stark split\" along political lines. The San Francisco Chronicle pointed out the disparity with a piece titled, \" As Intermarriage Spreads, Fault Lines Exposed .\"\n\nIt is easy to imagine liberal elites shaking their heads and sighing at these numbers. And no doubt their worst fears were confirmed when they saw that \"Among Americans who live in urban areas, 45% say [interracial marriage] is a good thing for society, as do 38% of those in the suburbs; lower shares among those living in rural areas share this view (24%).\" Yes, those folks in middle America, once again clinging to their guns, their religion, and their outdated racial views.\n\nBut the truth is that most Americans (52 percent) simply believe that intermarriage \"doesn't make much difference for our society.\" (That's true of 60 percent of Republicans and 63 percent of people who live in rural areas.) In other words, more than half of Americans couldn't care less who you marry. While liberals think we should run out and congratulate every interracial couple we see (and tell them their children are beautiful), most Americans think you should marry whomever you want. Which is probably how we ended up with a president whose third wife is a Slovenian supermodel.\n\nIt's correct that in order for intermarriage to be made legal, Americans did have to recognize the humanity of other races, but at this point, their attitude is much more \"live and let live.\" Sure, it's nice to think that Americans have come to fully embrace the idea that people who look different from them are worthy of finding marital happiness, but the truth may be slightly less noble.\n\nThe reason that interracial marriage became common, that no-fault divorce became ubiquitous, that gay marriage was legalized, and that we will probably get state-recognized polygamy and various other romantic arrangements is because Americans increasingly think what goes on in your bedroom is your own damn business.\n\nThere are plenty of conservatives who will argue that this attitude is problematic-not because they oppose interracial marriage, but because they believe that the public has an interest in stable, two-parent families. They think reasonably enough that we absolutely should care who it is our neighbors are marrying if we care about the welfare of families in our community. But frankly for most Americans, that horse has left the barn.\n\nLiberals, on the other hand will not be satisfied until every American praises people who marry outside their race and encourages their children to do the same. Indeed, if Republicans or folks from rural areas do not see the interracial marriages of their neighbors as something that is benefiting the country as a whole, they might as well be racists in this formulation.\n\nOf course there are reasons to think that interracial marriage, like any kind of racial or ethnic assimilation, might improve the fabric of our country. But the truth is that these marriages will happen anyway. Once the legal barriers to racial mixing came down, interracial marriage became mostly a matter of opportunity. As any marriage expert will tell you, we date and wed the people with whom we go to school and work. Or perhaps the people who appear on reality shows with us."

Eric Swalwell (D-CA) slid into Texas Republican congressional candidate Wesley Hunt's direct messages to continue a social media debate over the implications of Roe v. Wade for interracial marriage, the two men confirmed to the Washington Examiner .\n\nIn response to a bombshell leak from the Supreme Court suggesting that a reversal of Roe may be imminent, some proponents of the decision that legalized abortion nationwide argued its reversal may lead to states banning birth control or same-sex and interracial marriage.\n\nFACING LOOMING ROE REVERSAL, SENATE GOP TRIES TO STAY ON MESSAGE ABOUT ECONOMY\n\nSwalwell made that argument in a recent tweet.\n\nThe Republicans won't stop with banning abortion. They want to ban interracial marriage. Do you want to save that? Well, then you should probably vote. https://t.co/MRytdsjUBP\n\n- Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) May 3, 2022\n\nHunt, who is black, replied that the Texas district that nominated him is predominantly white, and he has an interracial marriage and family.\n\n\"Republicans are celebrating diversity while white liberals like yourself race-bait,\" Hunt wrote.\n\nHi Eric, my name is Wesley Hunt, I'm a Republican nominee in a Congressional District that is 70% white. I'm black, I'm in an interracial marriage, and my wife and I have two biracial daughters. Republicans are celebrating diversity while white liberals like yourself race-bait. https://t.co/r7bSNlskVp\n\n- Wesley Hunt (@WesleyHuntTX) May 3, 2022\n\nSwalwell replied that Hunt's problem should lie with a Republican senator who said that \"states should be able to ban interracial marriages like yours.\"\n\nHey Wesley, your problem isn't with me. It's with @SenatorBraun who said states should be able to ban interracial marriages like yours. He's a senator in YOUR party. Looks like you're just another Republican who is in denial of what your colleagues say. Party over country, right? https://t.co/mfH8tlilvg\n\n- Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) May 6, 2022\n\nHunt told the Washington Examiner , \"I saw that, and as somebody that is in an interracial marriage, that won a Republican primary in a district that is 70% white, with biracial children, I felt like that was utterly ridiculous to accuse, like, an entire party of people of being racist and against biracial marriages. And I called him out on it.\"\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram, Hunt's campaign said Swalwell's comments were \"race-baiting.\"\n\nSwalwell sent a private message in response to being tagged in the video.\n\n\"You're more pissed at me than the senator who wants to break up your marriage?\" Swalwell wrote in a screenshot of the message obtained by the Washington Examiner . \"Classic. You'll fit right in with the GOP.\"\n\nSwalwell confirmed he sent the private message in response to being tagged in the video on Instagram.\n\n\"He has not responded, and I'm not surprised,\" Swalwell told the Washington Examiner . \"How would you respond to that? Hunt is either lying to himself about what a GOP senator proposed and what it would mean for his family, or he's too afraid to confront it.\"\n\nHunt said, \"I've been black my entire life\" and that he felt he was being lectured by a white man on race.\n\n\"The first thing I would say to him is this: Be very careful with how you speak about racial issues when speaking with people of color,\" Hunt said. \"Just because you're a white man, that doesn't mean that you know more about this than me because you've never been black a day in your life. And I would like to think you would give me the benefit of the doubt as to how I can think for myself, given my own personal set of experiences.\"\n\nSwalwell said his tweet and message referenced March comments by Sen. Mike Braun (R-IN), who said in a discussion with local reporters that the Supreme Court should have left the matter of interracial marriage to the states to legislate. The high court legalized interracial marriage nationwide in Loving v. Virginia in 1967 by striking down state laws banning it.\n\n\"I think that that's something, if you're not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you're not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too,\" Braun said in March. \"I think that's hypocritical.\"\n\nBraun later walked back his comments, saying in a statement that he \"misunderstood a line of questioning\" and that \"there is no question the Constitution prohibits discrimination of any kind based on race.\"\n\nHunt argued Braun was \"put in a really bad position and articulated himself not in the best way.\"\n\n\"But his whole point was that all of these issues are states' rights issues. It should not be controlled by the federal government,\" Hunt said. \"So let's just say in a crazy world, the federal government overturned interracial marriage and sent it back to the states, no state is going to overturn interracial marriage. It's a complete farce. It's a complete joke. They're trying to gaslight the Left to think that we're racist, and we're not.\"\n\nBut Swalwell argued Braun is \"not alone,\" saying comparable arguments about interracial marriage are gaining traction in GOP circles.\n\n\"It's easy to attack me,\" Swalwell said. \"It's harder to show courage in the GOP. So, it looks like he'll fit right in with Kevin McCarthy and the other cowards.\"\n\nHunt predicted, \"We're going to have an extremely good African American turnout for the Republican Party this year,\" arguing the party is focused on issues such as unemployment and rising consumer costs."

      "text": "Senate passes landmark bill protecting same-sex marriage\n\nT he Senate passed landmark legislation on Tuesday that would provide federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriage, moving it one step closer to becoming law.\n\nThe upper chamber voted 61-36, with 12 Republicans joining all Democrats in passing the legislation. The bill will now head back to the House of Representatives , where lawmakers will need to pass an amended version before it reaches President Joe Biden's desk.\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act does not codify same-sex marriage protections. Instead, it recognizes marriage between two people regardless of their \"sex, race, ethnicity or national origin.\" The legislation does not require any state to permit same-sex couples to marry but does require all states to recognize any marriage that was legal in the state where it took place under the Constitution's full faith and credit clause. The legislation also repeals the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996, which defined \"marriage\" as between a man and a woman.\n\nWHY CONSERVATIVES ARE STAGING LAST-MINUTE PUSH TO OVERHAUL SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BILL\n\n\"We can ease the fear that millions of same-sex and interracial couples have that their freedoms and their rights could be stripped away,\" said Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), a sponsor of the bill. \"We are guaranteeing same-sex and interracial couples, regardless of where they live, that their marriage is legal.\"\n\nThe House passed a version of the legislation over the summer, with support from nearly 50 Republicans. The process in the Senate has taken more time amid GOP concerns about religious liberty. Senate Democrats held off on bringing the bill to the floor until after the midterm elections with the hope of gaining Republican support.\n\nEarlier this month, the Senate was able to clear the 60-vote procedural hurdle needed to move forward, passing it 62-37 with the support of 12 Republican members. Drafters of the bill were able to garner enough support from the GOP after Sens. Rob Portman (R-OH), Baldwin, Susan Collins (R-ME), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) crafted an amendment to address religious freedom concerns . The amendment ensures religious nonprofit groups will not be forced to violate their beliefs, affirms that right-to-conscience considerations apply to the bill, and makes clear that the bill doesn't allow for unions of more than two people. Those changes will need to be reflected in the House version before it heads to Biden.\n\nAhead of the procedural vote, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also came out in support of the amendment with the religious liberty protections.\n\n\"We believe this approach is the way forward,\" the Mormon church said in a statement. \"As we work together to preserve the principles and practices of religious freedom together with the rights of LGBTQ individuals, much can be accomplished to heal relationships and foster greater understanding.\"\n\nThree Republican amendments to address religious liberty concerns - from Sens. Mike Lee (UT), James Lankford (OK), and Marco Rubio (FL) - were voted on Tuesday as part of a time agreement, but each failed ahead of the final vote.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade prompted the legislation due to Justice Clarence Thomas's concurring opinion that the downfall of federally protected abortion access should also trigger the reconsideration of \"all of this Court's substantive due process precedents, including Griswold , Lawrence , and Obergefell ,\" with Obergefell v. Hodges being the 2015 decision that defined marriage as the union of two people, regardless of sex.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) has said the House will pass the legislation \"as soon as Tuesday\" of next week."

      "text": "Marriage is not an arbitrary institution\n\nIn the latest left-wing attack on the nuclear family , NPR suggested last week that \" marriage could look very different in the future.\"\n\nThe story noted that \"over the past few decades, cohabitation rates have nearly doubled\" and \"more children are being born outside of marriage.\" The taxpayer- subsidized organization then gleefully proclaimed that \"there's been buzz around polyamory and open relationships\" because \"younger generations [are] less set on following tradition.\"\n\nIt then quoted a \"polyamorous woman with a primary partner of 7 years\" who said, \"I definitely dreamt about getting married a lot when I was a kid, but as I got older, I realized marriage is basically just a piece of paper.\" This cynical approach to marriage is unsurprising when a secular worldview is adopted because marriage really is little more than a piece of paper if it is viewed as an earthly institution that comes with some tax benefits.\n\nA second person highlighted in the story is a gay man who said, \"I would love to be married one day. I decided that I wasn't going to wait for a man who may never come. So I started the process of surrogacy when I was around 30. Aphrodite Rose is now 4 1/2 months, so it's been wonderful.\" There is a lot to unpack there. Not only did he rent out the womb of a woman and use donated eggs to conceive a child who will be deprived of her mother forever, but he did it as a single man still actively seeking a partner.\n\nThe final vignette was of a man from Baltimore who said, \"My love life with my partner, Mae, looks like a true partnership. We are an interracial marriage, but I don't think it's ever posed an issue for us in our respective communities.\" NPR's attempt to conflate interracial marriage with polyamory or gay marriage is ridiculous because it does not fundamentally change what marriage is: the union between one man and one woman. Interracial marriage should not be controversial, nor is it controversial. According to a Gallup Poll from 2021, 94% of the public approves of interracial marriage, with even stronger support among younger people.\n\nThe story then included an interview with a \"futurist\" who said the future will \"have things that might stretch the meaning of what marriage is.\" He suggested that while \"polygamy has basically been a patriarchal institution,\" polyamory is distinct because \"younger generations are definitely more diverse, they're more tolerant of gender continuum, [they're] ideologically value-based, they're more open to that.\" He even went as far as to say, \"You know, do we need to do reproduction through the institution of marriage? I'm less inclined to say that has to be there.\"\n\nIt is abundantly clear, and has been for some time, that the nuclear family is under attack by the Left. In The Communist Manifesto , Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels explicitly called for the \"abolition of the family.\" Many communists view it as an institution that needs to be destroyed along with \"the distinction between town and country\" and \"the wage system\" for a successful revolution. More recently, the Black Lives Matter organization included on its website language encouraging the disruption of the \"Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.\"\n\nMarriage was redefined in U.S. law with the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, but that does not change the eternal nature of the institution itself, which cannot be changed by any government or any law. Despite recent polling suggesting that support for gay marriage has slightly declined , the mandate to overturn that decision will almost certainly never come. Therefore, normal people need to unite around clearly rejecting any further attempted redefinitions of marriage, particularly with respect to polyamory.\n\nMarriage, in the future, will look the exact same as it always has: one man and one woman. Marriage is not an arbitrary institution that can be reinvented simply because the sexual mores of a culture have changed."

      "text": "Four new laws taking effect in Virginia on Monday\n\nIn Virginia , various new laws passed by the General Assembly earlier this year take effect on Monday.\n\nThe laws passed by the Democratic-held state House and Senate and approved by Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) range from making to-go cocktails permanently legal to outlawing child marriage. Here are four of the laws going into effect in the Old Dominion.\n\nA pandemic-era provision was made permanent effective Monday when to-go cocktails were made legal on a permanent basis.\n\nTo-go cocktails were originally instituted via an order by then-Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) in April 2020, making the \"sale and delivery of mixed beverages and pre-mixed wine for off-premises consumption\" allowed with regulation. Youngkin signed a permanent extension into law earlier this year after signing a two-year extension into law in 2022.\n\nThe state became the 26th to make to-go cocktails legal when the bill was signed into law. Since Virginia approved the legislation, Massachusetts and Colorado have also permanently legalized to-go cocktails.\n\nLawmakers have raised the minimum age for marriage in the commonwealth in an effort to combat child marriages entirely in the Old Dominion. Earlier this year, the legislature and Youngkin approved a bill that changes the age for marriage from 16 to 18.\n\nUnder state law previously, 16- or 17-year-olds could get married if they had permission from a parent or guardian, but now, only those 18 or older may be married in the state effective Monday.\n\nAnother marriage-related bill, providing backstops to keep same-sex and interracial marriage legal in the state, will also go into effect on Monday. Both types of marriage were legalized via Supreme Court decisions.\n\nAnother piece of legislation that goes into effect on Monday bans legacy admissions at public universities within the state.\n\nPropelled by the 2023 Supreme Court decision to outlaw affirmative action, many activists cried foul that legacy admissions gave an unfair advantage to some applicants. Lawmakers in the Democratic-led chambers passed a bill outlawing legacy admissions, and Youngkin signed the bill.\n\nThe law means public institutions, such as the University of Virginia, may not consider if an applicant's family has connections to the school when deciding on admissions.\n\nAnother proposal that takes effect on Monday expands the definition of a hate crime to include ethnicity in a bid to counter rising antisemitism after the Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nThe expanded definition would protect people who are Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh, among other groups, from hate crimes, in addition to the previously held definition by the state, which protects based on race and sex, among other factors.\n\nOther changes to state law effective Monday include making it illegal to shut off utilities on homes during extreme cold or heat and allowing universities in the commonwealth to pay student-athletes through name, image, and likeness deals."

      "text": "These Republicans voted to preserve gay marriage. Here's why they're right\n\nAre gay marriage and interracial marriage really issues in 2022? Probably not, but the House did nonetheless just vote on a bill to enshrine legal recognition of both into federal law - with interesting results.\n\nDemocrats brought forth the \" Respect for Marriage Act \" in light of the Supreme Court's recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade . It would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, a voided but still-on-the-books federal law that defines marriage as between only a man and a woman. The legislation would also require states to recognize same-sex marriages legally performed in other states.\n\nHere's the context.\n\nCiting Justice Clarence Thomas's concurring opinion in the case overturning Roe , many on the Left fear that the rights to gay marriage and interracial marriage could be overturned next. For a number of reasons I explained here , including the other justices specifically saying they're not going to go there, I don't think these fears are well-founded. But they are nonetheless widespread.\n\nPassing legislation would take these fears off the table and undercut the Democrats' ability to use fearmongering about gay marriage as a political tactic heading into the 2022 midterm elections. It's also the right thing to do as a matter of limited government and individual liberty.\n\nThat's why the Respect for Marriage Act passed the House with 47 Republican votes, including \"yay\" votes from notable liberty lawmakers such as Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC), Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL), and Rep. Peter Meijer (R-MI).\n\n\"I'm a big fan of marriage, having done it a few times,\" Mace joked . \"And if gay couples want to be as happily or miserably married as straight couples, more power to them. Trust me on this.\"\n\nMeijer, for his part, explained in a video that while he doesn't actually believe either gay marriage or interracial marriage are in jeopardy, he still thought the Respect for Marriage Act made sense and deserved his support.\n\n\"I kind of expected [this bill] to be filled with poison pills,\" Meijer said. \"[Yet] it's only about 3.5 pages long, and it's pretty straightforward. It says that with regards to a marriage between two individuals regardless of sex, ethnicity, race, or national origin, if it is legally performed in one state it has to be recognized for the purposes of state-based actions, such as taxation, in another state. That's it.\"\n\n\"There's no compulsion,\" the Michigan Republican continued. \"There's no threats to religious freedom. There is just the simple of question of, in the unlikely event that [Supreme Court decisions establishing the right to gay and interracial marriage] go away, making sure that there isn't absolute chaos.\"\n\n\"I think it was the right choice from a limited government standpoint, from a liberty standpoint, and frankly from avoiding any circumstance where chaos could come down the line,\" Meijer concluded.\n\nThis is absolutely spot on.\n\nNow, to be clear, the 157 Republicans who voted against the Respect for Marriage Act had a variety of reasons for doing so. Not all of them actually oppose gay marriage - and they certainly don't oppose interracial marriage.\n\nMany argued that it was a political stunt by Democrats not worth taking seriously.\n\nThey're right that this is certainly a partisan tactic from Democratic leadership with the election on their mind. But that's not a good reason to vote against an otherwise commonsense bill - and why play into their hands?\n\nDemocrats brought this bill for a vote precisely so they could accuse Republicans of being anti-gay marriage and anti-interracial marriage and fearmonger about those rights being in jeopardy. If Republicans just vote for it, these attacks lose all credibility! Instead, dissidents decided to play right into the Democrats' hands.\n\nOther GOP opponents argued that marriage is a state's rights issue or that the government ought not to be involved in marriage at all. This is a legitimate perspective, but again, it does not justify voting against the Respect for Marriage Act.\n\nFor one thing, if you truly believe gay marriage is a state's rights issue, then you ought to support getting rid of DOMA because it imposed a traditionalist definition of marriage on to the entire country via federal law.\n\nAnd yes, federalism - leaving most things up to states - is generally a good principle. But it's not really workable as a practical matter for citizens' marriages to be recognized in one state but then, if they move, suddenly, they are no longer married. Imagine the havoc that would wreak on tax issues, property issues, medical/emergency contact powers, and even the legal parental status of adopted parents.\n\nAs far as not having the government involved in marriage at all, that's certainly a defensible position in the abstract. But it's not where we are in reality, and there's no realistic chance of getting there any time soon.\n\nAs long as the government is involved in legally recognizing marriages for both financial and legal purposes, it should do so equally for both traditional and same-sex marriages. Anything less is downright discriminatory - and inconsistent with principles of individual liberty.\n\nWhile legal recognition of gay marriage is wildly popular among the public and even a slim majority of Republican voters, the 47 Republicans who bucked the rest of their party and voted to protect gay marriage are certainly going to come under some withering criticism. But they can take solace in the fact that their vote will age well.\n\nBrad Polumbo ( @Brad_Polumbo ) is a co-founder of Based-Politics.com , a co-host of the BasedPolitics podcast , and a Washington Examiner contributor."

      "text": "No, Jezebel, interracial relationships don't \"further white supremacy\"\n\nLiberal outrage over film and cinema has reached an all-time high. Instead of focusing attention onto issues that actually matter, Aditi Natasha Kini decided to share her thoughts via Jezebel that the movie The Big Sick is bad because interracial marriage advances white supremacy.\n\nThe film, which is based on a true story, depicts how Pakistani Muslim comedy writer Kumail Nanjiani (who plays himself) met his now-wife Emily Gordon (portrayed by Zoe Kazan), a white American woman. It's a heartwarming tale, and shows the struggles that some couples go through when cultures clash and they're forced to find some common ground.\n\nKini, who had some nice things to say about the film overrall, was unimpressed with how Nanjiani's story and Aziz Ansari's Netflix show Master of None were erasing brown women in entertainment. The title of her story says it all, \"I'm Tired of Watching Brown Men Fall in Love With White Women Onscreen.\"\n\n\"They're both masturbatory fantasies that give brown men the vantage point of a white male cinephile,\" Kini wrote. \"They're similar in that they're comedians who hold white media accountable for under-representation of brown people, yet seem to be casting non-brown women in the meatiest roles.\"\n\nShe continued. \"In short: this is not good enough. Representation isn't a checklist, or an excuse for exclusion of more minoritized people. 'Representation' like this furthers white supremacy and does not engage with critiques of white allyship.\"\n\nLet me just say for the record that I am a product of a brown Pakistan Muslim man falling in love with a white American woman. And while my three siblings are all married to or engaged to brown people (Indian, Bengali, and Pakistani), I'm currently the one dissenter by dating a Jewish woman.\n\nDoes that mean I'm advancing white supremacy? Of course not.\n\nLiberals constantly preach that you should marry the person you love, especially when it comes to debates over same-sex marriage. But when it comes to marrying outside your race or ethnicity, all of sudden it's taboo.\n\nWhile Kini cites Mindy Kaling, an Indian American woman, finding plenty of white male love in The Mindy Project , she failed to recognize that in another wildly popular show, Quantico , Indian actress Priyanka Chopra is the object of affection for white men, too.\n\nDo these shows advance white supremacy? God, no. If anything, all of these shows continue to normalize the idea of interracial couples and marriage that was actually illegal in the United States 50 years ago before Loving v. Virginia .\n\nThis proves that liberals and social justice warriors are literally finding the tiniest things to be mad about and making a career out of it."

      "text": "The Loving lie: Debunking the fearmongering about overturning Roe v. Wade\n\n[ This piece has been published in Restoring America to highlight how overturning Roe v. Wade falls in line with a proper interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment .]\n\nThere's a lot of fearmongering these days about what the leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion potentially overturning Roe v. Wade would mean if it is, in fact, issued.\n\nBelieve none of it.\n\nSerious and principled legal minds like professor Akhil Reed Amar of Yale and professor Sherif Girgis of Notre Dame have already done excellent work putting most of these lies regarding the upcoming decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization to the torch.\n\nMy task here is more modest - to finish their work by dismantling the most recent and most absurd claim: That the draft Dobbs opinion would lead to overruling Loving v. Virginia , which held that governments cannot ban or criminalize interracial marriage.\n\nThis argument has no merit whatsoever. Anyone with even a passing familiarity with the Constitution knows it.\n\nThis issue strikes home for me: I'm in an interracial marriage and I could not be less worried. I am as confident that Loving will remain good law as I am that the sun will rise in the east tomorrow and every day thereafter.\n\nWhy? Because the holding in Loving was compelled by the Constitution's text. The holding in Roe v. Wade , on the other hand, was not.\n\nLoving corrected a constitutional mistake. Roe was a constitutional mistake.\n\nThe leaked Dobbs opinion says the same thing that Loving did: The court got it wrong, and it's time we interpret the Constitution as it's written and stop twisting it to mean what we want it to mean.\n\nLoving was a 14th Amendment challenge to a law banning interracial marriage. The 14th Amendment guarantees the equality of all people regardless of race. Loving held that the amendment meant what it said.\n\nFor almost a hundred years before the Loving decision in 1967, the Supreme Court disregarded that amendment. Beginning with the Slaughter-House cases and United States v. Cruikshank and culminating in the constitutional abomination that was Plessy v. Ferguson , the Supreme Court all but erased it from the Constitution. The court held that the amendment, which was ratified to make all people equal in the eyes of the law, did nothing of the sort.\n\nThe court was wrong. Egregiously, obviously, infuriatingly wrong. Loving was one of many great cases that fixed that error.\n\nThe key mistake in logic made by those who think Dobbs will pose a threat to Loving is that they think that Loving created a right to interracial marriage just as Roe created a right to abortion. It did no such thing. That right is inherent in our nature. Loving simply recognized what the 14th Amendment says: The government may not discriminate by race.\n\nThe Dobbs draft, therefore, has nothing to say about Loving . The draft says, rightly, that Roe was \"egregiously wrong\" and its reasoning \"exceptionally weak\" and \"far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation of the various constitutional provisions to which it vaguely pointed.\"\n\nIt says, rightly again, that the court \"has neither the authority nor the expertise\" to decide debates about the interrelationship of science and morality; those are debates for the democratic process.\n\nWhat the court can and should do in Dobbs is affirm that the Constitution's text means what it says, which is exactly what it did in Loving .\n\nLoving is going nowhere. Anyone who argues otherwise is wrong and is either betraying his ignorance or worse, lying to you.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in the Daily Signal and is reprinted with kind permission from the Heritage Foundation ."

The latest came via Whoopi Goldberg on The View who claimed that Trump plans to break up interracial married couples and deport the person who is not white.\n\nNot only that, but Golderberg also claimed that Trump would then \"put the white guy with someone else.\"\n\nIt's completely absurd claim that resides only in her warped reality.\n\n\"He's not gonna be - he's not gonna say, 'Oh, you're with a white guy, I'm gonna keep you from being deported,'\" Goldberg blurted.\n\n\"No, he's gonna deport you and put the white guy with someone else,\" she ridiculously asserted.\n\n\"The man is out there!\" she screamed wide eyed.\n\nWhoopi now says Trump is going to break up interracial marriages... deport the wives...

Look how crazy she is.\n\nIf this is what they're like now, imagine what's going to happen when Trump wins.\n\nThey've all been irrational all along. Now they're becoming rabid. Just watch what happens if Trump wins. They'll go completely spare. We're talkin' ballistic insanity. I want Trump to win, anyway, but I'd love him to win just for the leftist meltdown. It'll be epic🤣\n\nAs if that wasn't enough batshit crazy, The View then wheeled out \"Morning Joe\" host Mika Brzezinski who literally started crying and saying all Trump supporters are Nazis.\n\n\"These are the final hours,\" she warned, adding \"I come with such dire warnings, and I mean them from the bottom of my heart!\" asserting that we are witnessing the \"descent into fascism.\"\n\nBrzezinski sheiks that if Americans elect Trump again, it will our \"descent into fascism\" and \"normalization\" of it. \"I come with such dire warnings, and I mean them from the bottom of my heart!\" she insisted pic.twitter.com/FO5hiPgAxD\n\nThere sure were a lot of jewish, brown, black, and latino Nazis at that rally.\n\n* * *\n\nYour support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

      "text": "Supreme Court Leans Towards Upholding Tennessee Restrictions On Child Trans Treatments\n\nUpdate (1420ET): After 2.5 hours of arguments, the Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared to lean towards upholding Tennessee's ban on 'gender-affirming care' for minors.\n\nDuring arguments, several conservative justices questioned the Biden administration's claim that there's \"overwhelming\" evidence supporting supposed benefits of giving children puberty blockers and hormone treatments.\n\n\"I wonder if you would like to stand by this statement, or if you think it would now be appropriate to modify that and withdraw the statement,\" said Justice Samuel Alito, who pointed to several European nations that have banned the practice.\n\nJustice Prett Kavanaugh, meanwhile, said \"If it's evolving like that and changing, and England is pulling back and Sweden is pulling back, it strikes me as a a pretty heavy yellow light, if not red light, for this court to come in, the nine of us, and constitutionalize the whole area. \"\n\n*  *  *\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a pivotal case challenging Tennessee's 2023 law banning gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender minors . The case, brought by the Biden administration on behalf of families of trans youth, has brought the question of transgender youth and the role of state regulation of medical procedures into sharp focus.\n\nAt the heart of the case is Tennessee's 2023 prohibition on prescribing hormone therapies - such as puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy - to transgender individuals under 18. While the law does not extend to surgical interventions, which are rarely performed on minors, it represents a significant restriction on gender-affirming care. While the Biden administration is leading the charge, the law is being challenged by three transgender teenagers, their families, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who argue that the legislation violates constitutional rights.\n\nListen:\n\nWho could have seen this coming?\n\nKetanji Brown Jackson just compared bans on sex changes for kids to bans on interracial marriage. pic.twitter.com/XOOZRLOI2N\n\nOh...\n\nHuge moment at SCOTUS.

ACLU attorney Chase Strangio admits in response that there's \"no evidence\" that these procedures actually reduce suicides. pic.twitter.com/shl1PyGpS8\n\nAs Truth in Media notes further; Chase Strangio, a notable figure as the first openly transgender lawyer to argue before the Supreme Court, articulated the case's essence. \"The government of Tennessee is displacing the decision-making of loving parents,\" Strangio argued, emphasizing that such care is supported by numerous medical associations, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, for its benefits in alleviating gender dysphoria.\n\nNEW: ACLU transgender lawyer says children should be allowed to be castr*ted, stating that even two-year-olds know when it's time to transition. Nothing could prepare me for this voice. Transgender Chase Strangio will be arguing before the Supreme Court in favor of trans... pic.twitter.com/F0AswDi6M4\n\nThe state, however, defends its position , with Sen. Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, asserting that the legislation is akin to other age-based restrictions like tattoos or alcohol consumption, aimed at protecting minors from irreversible decisions. Tennessee's argument hinges on the notion that the law regulates medical practices rather than discriminates based on sex or gender identity.\n\nThis case arrives at the Supreme Court amid a broader wave of legislation across the U.S., where more than two dozen states have similar restrictions. The outcome could set a precedent not only for transgender youth but potentially for all minors seeking medical care that involves hormone treatments or puberty blockers for any condition.\n\nThe courtroom was packed on Wednesday, with observers from various advocacy groups and parents of transgender children present, highlighting the personal stakes involved. For families like that of LW, a transgender teen from Tennessee, the law has forced them to undertake long journeys out of state to continue her medical treatment, illustrating the practical implications of such bans.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision, expected by summer, could either affirm the rights of transgender youth to access gender-affirming care or uphold state authority to regulate medical treatments for minors . This ruling might also influence future cases regarding transgender rights, especially in states with pending or active litigation against similar bans.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Forcing Churches to Perform Same-Sex Marriages Would End Separation of Church and State\n\nL et me begin by restating that I am in favor of same-sex marriage . While the logic behind Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy's legal opinion which decreed same-sex marriage to be the law of the land last week is dubious, I believe nonetheless that same-sex couples who live in the United States and wish to marry ought to be able to do so.\n\nBy the same token, I do not believe churches, synagogues, mosques or other religious assemblies should be obligated to perform same-sex weddings if such unions go against their teachings. That decision must be left to the churches and their congregations to decide. If the federal government sees fit to either compel churches to perform same-sex marriages or punish them for refusing to do so then it is interfering in the internal affairs of religious congregations. Churches would cease to be autonomous organizations and become functionaries of the whims of the government. This would be a violation of the separation of church and state.\n\nAs Rich Lowry of National Review Online noted shortly after the Supreme Court's ruling, \"The gay-marriage debate isn't over; it has merely entered a new phase.\" To be specific, Lowry notes, \"Already, there are a few calls to remove the tax exemption of churches now opposed to what the Supreme Court has deemed a fundamental right.\"\n\nEnter Felix Salmon of Fusion :\n\nBecause now that the US government formally recognizes marriage equality as a fundamental right, it really shouldn't skew the tax code so as to give millions of dollars in tax breaks to groups which remain steadfastly bigoted on the subject.\n\nI'm talking, of course, about churches.\n\nSalmon argues that churches which refuse to perform same-sex marriages should have their tax exempt status revoked in the same manner that Bob Jones University did after refusing to admit students who were part of an interracial marriage or engaged in interracial dating. Citing the 1983 U.S. Supreme Court decision which upheld the IRS' removal of Bob Jones University's tax exempt status, Salmon writes:\n\nIn the Bob Jones case, the US government made a very important statement. It's not enough, they said, to support the right of interracial couples to date and get married; it's also important to register official disapproval of any organizations which fail to support that right. To be given exemption from paying taxes is a special privilege bestowed by the state on deserving organizations. But there's nothing deserving about an organization that bans interracial dating. So, the state is entirely within its powers to remove that privilege.\n\nThe same argument can and should be applied to gay marriage. If your organization does not support the right of gay men and women to marry, then the government should be very clear that you're in the wrong. And it should certainly not bend over backwards to give you the privilege of tax exemption.\n\nHowever, what Salmon conveniently omits with regard to the Bob Jones case is that it does not apply to churches . The Court stated, \"We deal here only with religious schools - not with churches or other purely religious institutions; here, the governmental interest is in denying public support to racial discrimination in education.\"\n\nContrary to Salmon's claims that the government should be very clear in telling churches they in the wrong for not supporting same-sex marriage, there is no absolutely governmental interest where it concerns the affairs of churches or purely religious institutions. Simply put, the government has no business telling churches and purely religious institutions that they are in the wrong about opposition to gay marriage or any other matter.\n\nOne such matter is war. When the Bush Administration decided to lead a coalition into Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein there were numerous churches which made their opposition known. What if the Bush Administration had saw fit to remove the tax-exempt status of these churches for having opposed the War in Iraq? What if they took it upon themselves to tell churches they were in the wrong about going into Iraq. There would have been an uproar above and beyond the uproar against the war and rightly so. It is inconceivable that those who wish to remove the tax exempt status of churches for refusing to perform same-sex marriages would have supported a similar measure against the very same churches concerning the War in Iraq.\n\nAnother such matter is the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel with regard to its alleged mistreatment of the Palestinians. Over the years, a number of churches have seen fit to boycott Israel and divest their holdings in Israeli companies or companies which do business with Israel in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. The United Church of Christ decided to do this last week to which I made my objections known .\n\nAs much I abhor the decision of the UCC to participate in a campaign which seeks to delegitimize the State of Israel and thereby increase global anti-Semitism, I believe it would be equally wrong for the IRS to revoke the tax exempt status of the UCC and its affiliates. If UCC or any other church boycotts Israel it isn't the place of the federal government to tell them they are in the wrong. While I and others are entitled to believe their decision to support the BDS movement is morally wrong and reprehensible, it is still their decision to make.\n\nWith this in mind, while I might disagree with a church for not seeing fit to perform a same-sex marriage, it is ultimately their decision to make and their decision alone. The federal government must leave churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious assemblies alone in this matter. If they do not see fit to leave them alone then the very concept of the separation of church and state will have lost all meaning. It would end the separation of church and state as we know it.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

      "text": "CATO Gay Marriage Forum: Optimism? \"Yes\"\n\nE arly Wednesday afternoon, the Cato Institute hosted a forum titled \"Law, Politics, and Same-Sex Marriage.\" The consensus among the four legal and political experts was that however the Supreme Court rules on Proposition 8 and DOMA, public opinion is steadily, generationally shifting toward support for gay marriage on the basis of legal equality, including a full 64% of evangelical millennials.\n\nCato's Walter Olson moderated a wide-ranging discussion with colleague and legal whiz Ilya Shapiro, Freedom to Marry 's Evan Wolfson, and former RNC Chair Ken Mehlman, who publicly came out in August 2010 to advocate for gay marriage. The participants were essentially united on this point, spending half the allotted time dissecting SCOTUS and splitting the rest between a broad cultural, political discussion and audience questions.\n\nShapiro predicted a 4-1-4 decision on the DOMA without a controlling opinion: \"the four so-called liberal justices would probably strike it down on equal protection grounds\" and the mercurial Justice Kennedy seems primed to reject the crucial Section 3, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, on federalism grounds. Like yesterday's Proposition 8 case, there were some questions about the respondent's standing (the State of California and Federal Government have refused to defend Prop 8 and DOMA respectively), but Prop 8 is much more likely to be sent back to federal appeals without a decision on this procedural issue.\n\nMehlman followed up with the declaration that \"history is on our side,\" saying that the best way to influence the high court is to continue winning new states and new hearts and minds. All agreed that distinctions between individuals, not the nature of the individuals themselves, was the key legal question. \"The whole reason we have a constitution and courts is that some things are not polled and some things are not put up to a vote,\" said Wolfson, offering the example of interracial marriage bans struck down in the face of staunch public support.

(AP) - One day in the 1970s, Paul Fleisher and his wife were walking through a department store parking lot when they noticed a group of people looking at them. Fleisher, who is white, and his wife, who is Black, were used to \"the look.\" But this time it was more intense.\n\n\"There was this white family who was just staring at us, just staring holes in us,\" Fleisher recalled.\n\nThat fraught moment occurred even though any legal uncertainty about the validity of interracial marriage had ended a decade earlier - in 1967, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down state laws banning marriages between people of different races.\n\nIn the more than half-century since, interracial marriage has become more common and far more accepted. So Fleisher was surprised that Congress felt the need to include an additional protection in the Respect for Marriage Act, which goes to the House for a vote expected Thursday. It would ensure that not only same-sex marriages, but also interracial marriages, are enshrined in federal law.\n\nThe 74-year-old Fleisher, a retired teacher and children's book author, attended segregated public schools in the 1950s in the then-Jim Crow South, and later saw what he called \"token desegregation\" in high school, when four Black students were in his senior class of about 400 students.\n\nHe and his wife, Debra Sims Fleisher, 73, live outside Richmond, about 50 miles from Caroline County, where Mildred Jeter, a Black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, were arrested and charged in 1958 with marrying out of state and returning to Virginia, where interracial marriage was illegal. Their challenge to the law led to Loving v. Virginia, the landmark ruling that ended bans against interracial marriages .\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act, which passed the Senate l ast week, has been picking up steam since June, when the Supreme Court overturned the federal right to an abortion . The ruling included a concurring opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas that suggested the high court should review other precedent-setting rulings, including the 2015 decision legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nWhile much of the attention has been focused on protections for same-sex marriages, interracial couples say they are glad Congress also included protections for their marriages, even though their right to marry was well-established decades ago.\n\n\"It's a little unnerving that these things where we made such obvious progress are now being challenged or that we feel we have to really beef up the bulwark to keep them in place,\" said Ana Edwards, a historian who lives in Richmond.\n\nEdwards, 62, who is Black, and her husband, Phil Wilayto, 73, who is white, have been married since 2006. Both have been community activists for years and said they didn't consider interracial marriage a potentially vulnerable institution until the Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion.\n\n\"That reminds all of us that whatever rights we have in this society are conditional - they can be taken away,\" said Wilayto. \"The fact that Congress had to take up this issue in 2022 should be a stark reminder of that fact for us.\"\n\nFor younger interracial couples, the thought that their right to marry could ever be threatened is a foreign concept.\n\n\"We never in our wildest dreams thought we would need to be protected as an interracial couple,\" said Derek Mize, a 42-year-old white attorney who lives in an Atlanta suburb with his husband, Jonathan Gregg, 41, who is Black, and their two children.\n\nAs a same-sex couple, they were at the forefront of the long struggle for acceptance and felt the elation that followed the 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage across the country.\n\nStill, they see the need for new protections for interracial marriages as well.\n\n\"We're really relieved that there is this law,\" Mize said. \"Protections through the courts and protections through the legislation certainly helps us sleep better at night.\"\n\nMize said he remembers studying Loving v. Virginia in law school and thought then that it was \"ridiculous\" that there had to be litigation over marriages between people of different races. But after he read the Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade, he said: \"Who knows where it will stop?\"\n\nGregg, a management consultant, said he sees the Respect for Marriage Act as \"an added level of safety\" for same-sex and interracial marriages - a federal law and Supreme Court rulings supporting their right to marry.\n\n\"You've got two ways to be OK,\" he said. \"They have to take down both of them in order for your marriage to fall apart.\"\n\nAngelo Villagomez, a 44-year-old senior fellow at the think tank Center for American Progress, said it was \"unthinkable\" that his marriage could become illegal. Villagomez, who is of mixed white and Indigenous Mariana Islands descent, and his wife, Eden Villagomez, 38, who is Filipina, live in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut after the overturning of Roe v. Wade, \"it feels like some of those things that have just been taken for granted ... are under threat,\" said Villagomez, whose parents, also a mixed-race couple, were married in the 1970s, not long after the Loving decision.\n\nVillagomez worries about what could come next. \"If we don't put a stop to some of this backsliding, this country is gonna go to a very dark place,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm worried about what else is on the chopping block.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Claire Savage contributed to this report from Chicago.\n\n___\n\nSavage is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

But they also say more work needs to be done.\n\nThe measure advanced due to supporters' fears that a conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court may undo rights that took decades to obtain, just as the court overturned the longstanding right to abortion earlier this year. And it does not stop states from denying these couples the right to marry in the future, should the Supreme Court ever overturn the 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nStill the broad support for the bill, which was backed by 12 GOP senators, was unexpected given the long and divisive history of the issue. Biden has said he will \"promptly and proudly sign it into law.\"\n\nWHAT'S IN THE BILL?\n\nThe legislation says that federal and state governments must recognize legally celebrated marriages regardless of the individuals' sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin, and it would allow people to sue to enforce those rights.\n\nIt also maintains current religious freedom or conscience protections, stating that nonprofit religious organizations or nonprofits that are religious in nature do not need to provide goods, services or accommodations for the celebration of the marriages. For example, a church that doesn't support same-sex marriage would not be required to rent out space for such a union.\n\nHOW DID WE GET HERE?\n\nIt was roughly 25 years ago that a bipartisan majority passed the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which defined marriage as between one woman and one man. It said the federal government did not recognize same-sex marriages for purposes such as filing taxes or receiving Social Security survivor benefits, and that states didn't have to recognize same-sex unions conducted in other states.\n\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court ruled that the part of DOMA that said the federal government wouldn't recognize same-sex marriages was unconstitutional.\n\nTwo years later, in an opinion known as Obergefell v. Hodges , the court found bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. That monumental decision legalized gay marriage nationwide, ending bans in 14 states that still had them. Since then, hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples have married.\n\nFor interracial couples in the US, the right to marry has been recognized much longer. A 1960s-era Supreme Court decision, Loving v. Virginia, invalidated state laws that banned marriages between people of different races.\n\nIn the years after Obergefell, some supporters of gay rights worried the freedom to marry could one day be revoked, and pursued versions of the Respect for Marriage Act, said Jon Davidson, senior staff attorney for the ACLU's LGBTQ & HIV Project and co-counsel on Obergefell.\n\nBut there wasn't the urgency or political will to advance it - until this summer.\n\nWHY NOW?\n\nIn June, a new conservative majority on the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established the right to an abortion and had stood for almost 50 years. The ruling gave states the power to decide whether to ban abortion, and almost immediately a patchwork of laws went into effect, including near-total bans in about a dozen states.\n\nWriting for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said \"(n)othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\" But it was the words of a fellow conservative, Justice Clarence Thomas, that alarmed gay-rights supporters.\n\n\"I agree that '(n)othing in (the Court's) opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion,'\" Thomas wrote. \"For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court's substantive due process precedents.\" That included Obergefell, Thomas wrote.\n\nThe statements \"understandably terrified a lot of people\" and gave new momentum to the Respect for Marriage Act, said Andrew Koppelman, John Paul Stevens Professor of Law at Northwestern University.\n\n\"We've got half a million same-sex couples in the United States, and Thomas essentially says to them, 'I'm coming for you next,'\" Koppelman said. \"And so that generates some urgency that was not there before.\"\n\nThere's no case on the horizon that asks the Supreme Court to undo rulings that protect same-sex and interracial marriages. But Democrats opted to act while they had control of both chambers of Congress and the White House.\n\nThe House voted on an early version of the bill in July, and the final tally caught some by surprise: 267-157, with 47 Republicans voting in favor.\n\nThe vote reflected an overall change in the public's views, Davidson said. At one point, most people in the U.S. opposed same-sex marriage. But in a June Gallup poll, 71% of U.S. adults said same-sex unions should be valid under the law.\n\nDemocrats delayed consideration of the bill in the 50-50 Senate until after the Nov. 8 election, hoping to get 10 Republicans on board and reach the 60-vote threshold necessary to overcome the filibuster.\n\nPost-election, there was a new reason for Democrats to act quickly, for fear that a new GOP majority in the House would refuse to consider the bill come January.\n\nWHAT WOULD THE BILL CHANGE?\n\n\"In many ways it freezes most of what is already the current law,\" Davidson said, describing it as \"a bulwark against the Supreme Court possibly reversing the Obergefell decision as it reversed Roe v. Wade.\"\n\nThe legislation wouldn't codify, or enshrine into law, Obergefell, which now requires states to issue same-sex marriage licenses. So if the bill is signed into law, and the Supreme Court later overturns Obergefell, some states could stop issuing those licenses. But all states would still have to recognize same-sex marriages performed legally in other states.\n\nThe practical effect of that would be that some people couldn't get married in their own states, but all same-sex marriages would continue to be recognized and eligible for the legal benefits of marriage.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions to ensure federal benefits remain for same-sex married couples, such as tax, pension and health benefits.\n\nWHAT HAS BEEN THE REACTION?\n\nMost Republicans still oppose the legislation, saying it is unnecessary and citing concerns about religious liberty. In recent weeks some conservative groups also have spoken out against it. After the Senate approved the measure Tuesday, an official from Alliance Defending Freedom criticized it as jeopardizing the religious freedom of millions of Americans.\n\n\"This dangerously cynical and completely unnecessary bill is a direct attack on the First Amendment,\" said Ryan Bangert, the organization's senior vice president of strategic initiatives.\n\nTo Davidson, the vote shows how public perception on the issue has changed. He said the public has seen over the past few years that conservatives' doomsday views of what could happen if same-sex couples were allowed was \"fear-mongering.\"\n\n\"They actually said 'Civilization as we know it will end,'\" he recalled. \"And now same-sex couples have been able to get legally married and to have those marriages recognized in the United States for seven years everywhere in the country, and nothing bad has happened.\"\n\nAt the same time, the LGBTQ community has been the target of violence, Davidson said, noting the recent murders at a gay nightclub in Colorado. He called on Congress to do more to protect the transgender community and others who have been victimized.\n\n\"Being able to have your marriage recognized and treated equally is important, but it's not as important as being able to stay alive,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Mary Clare Jalonick and Mark Sherman contributed from Washington.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

The bill received unanimous support from Democrats, plus 12 Republicans who also backed the bill in a procedural vote earlier this month.\n\n\"With today's bipartisan Senate passage of the Respect for Marriage Act, the United States is on the brink of reaffirming a fundamental truth: love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person they love,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement responding to the bill's passage Tuesday.\n\nLawmakers began voting around 3:45 p.m. on three separate amendments proposed by Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Marco Rubio of Florida and James Lankford of Oklahoma.\n\nThe amendments called for additional protections for religious freedoms after some Republicans expressed concern that other changes to the bill did not go far enough. The bill passed without Lee's amendment, which would have prevented the government from retaliating against religious individuals and institutions for their religious beliefs regarding marriage.\n\n\"This is a discouraging development in our country's storied history of protecting the free exercise of religion,\" Lee tweeted after the vote. \"While I'm disappointed that my amendment was not included, I remain committed to preserving the religious liberties enshrined in our Constitution for all Americans.\"\n\npic.twitter.com/6F0LvDWwHc- Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) November 29, 2022\n\nThe final bill, which did include a provision to ensure polygamous marriage remains illegal in the United States, repeals the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples.\n\nThe measure now goes back to the U.S. House for another vote.

      "text": "50 years after Loving: Interracial couples still face strife\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Fifty years after Mildred and Richard Loving's landmark legal challenge shattered the laws against interracial marriage in the U.S., some couples of different races still talk of facing discrimination, disapproval and sometimes outright hostility from their fellow Americans.\n\nAlthough the racist laws against mixed marriages are gone, several interracial couples said in interviews they still get nasty looks, insults and sometimes even violence when people find out about their relationships.\n\n\"I have not yet counseled an interracial wedding where someone didn't have a problem on the bride's or the groom's side,\" said the Rev. Kimberly D. Lucas of St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C.\n\nShe often counsels engaged interracial couples through the prism of her own 20-year marriage - Lucas is black and her husband, Mark Retherford, is white.\n\n\"I think for a lot of people it's OK if it's 'out there' and it's other people but when it comes home and it's something that forces them to confront their own internal demons and their own prejudices and assumptions, it's still really hard for people,\" she said.\n\nInterracial marriages became legal nationwide on June 12, 1967, after the Supreme Court threw out a Virginia law that sent police into the Lovings' bedroom to arrest them just for being who they were: a married black woman and white man.\n\nThe Lovings were locked up and given a year in a Virginia prison, with the sentence suspended on the condition that they leave Virginia. Their sentence is memorialized on a marker to go up on Monday in Richmond, Virginia, in their honor.\n\nThe Supreme Court's unanimous decision struck down the Virginia law and similar statutes in roughly one-third of the states. Some of those laws went beyond black and white, prohibiting marriages between whites and Native Americans, Filipinos, Indians, Asians and in some states \"all non-whites.\"\n\nThe Lovings, a working-class couple from a deeply rural community, weren't trying to change the world and were media-shy, said one of their lawyers, Philip Hirschkop, now 81 and living in Lorton, Virginia. They simply wanted to be married and raise their children in Virginia.\n\nBut when police raided their Central Point home in 1958 and found a pregnant Mildred in bed with her husband and a District of Columbia marriage certificate on the wall, they arrested them, leading the Lovings to plead guilty to cohabitating as man and wife in Virginia.\n\n\"Neither of them wanted to be involved in the lawsuit, or litigation or taking on a cause. They wanted to raise their children near their family where they were raised themselves,\" Hirschkop said.\n\nBut they knew what was at stake in their case.\n\n\"It's the principle. It's the law. I don't think it's right,\" Mildred Loving said in archival video footage shown in an HBO documentary. \"And if, if we do win, we will be helping a lot of people.\"\n\nRichard Loving died in 1975, Mildred Loving in 2008.\n\nSince the Loving decision, Americans have increasingly dated and married across racial and ethnic lines. Currently, 11 million people - or 1 out of 10 married people - in the United States have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nIn 2015, 17 percent of newlyweds - or at least 1 in 6 of newly married people - were intermarried, which means they had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity. When the Supreme Court decided the Lovings' case, only 3 percent of newlyweds were intermarried.\n\nBut interracial couples can still face hostility from strangers and sometimes violence.\n\nIn the 1980s, Michele Farrell, who is white, was dating an African American man and they decided to look around Port Huron, Michigan, for an apartment together. \"I had the woman who was showing the apartment tell us, 'I don't rent to coloreds. I definitely don't rent to mixed couples,'\" Farrell said.\n\nIn March, a white man fatally stabbed a 66-year-old black man in New York City, telling the Daily News that he'd intended it as \"a practice run\" in a mission to deter interracial relationships. In August 2016 in Olympia, Washington, Daniel Rowe, who is white, walked up to an interracial couple without speaking, stabbed the 47-year-old black man in the abdomen and knifed his 35-year-old white girlfriend. Rowe's victims survived and he was arrested.\n\nAnd even after the Loving decision, some states tried their best to keep interracial couples from marrying.\n\nIn 1974, Joseph and Martha Rossignol got married at night in Natchez, Mississippi, on a Mississippi River bluff after local officials tried to stop them. But they found a willing priest and went ahead anyway.\n\n\"We were rejected everyplace we went, because no one wanted to sell us a marriage license,\" said Martha Rossignol, who has written a book about her experiences then and since as part of a biracial couple. She's black, he's white.\n\n\"We just ran into a lot of racism, a lot of issues, a lot of problems. You'd go into a restaurant, people wouldn't want to serve you. When you're walking down the street together, it was like you've got a contagious disease.\"\n\nBut their love survived, Rossignol said, and they returned to Natchez to renew their vows 40 years later.\n\nInterracial couples can now be seen in books, television show, movies and commercials. Former President Barack Obama is the product of a mixed marriage, with a white American mother and an African father. Public acceptance is growing, said Kara and William Bundy, who have been married since 1994 and live in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n\"To America's credit, from the time that we first got married to now, I've seen much less head turns when we walk by, even in rural settings,\" said William, who is black. \"We do go out for hikes every once in a while, and we don't see that as much any longer. It really is dependent on where you are in the country and also the locale.\"\n\nEven in the South, interracial couples are common enough that oftentimes no one notices them, even in a state like Virginia, Hirschkop said.\n\n\"I was sitting in a restaurant and there was a mixed couple sitting at the next table and they were kissing and they were holding hands,\" he said. \"They'd have gotten hung for something like 50 years ago and no one cared - just two people could pursue their lives. That's the best part of it, those quiet moments.\"\n\n___\n\nJesse J. Holland covers race and ethnicity for The Associated Press in Washington.

Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said on the House floor.\n\n\"We must do everything in our power to ensure that Republican-controlled state legislatures don't have the opportunity to restrict the rights of LGBTQ or interracial couples in America,\" Nadler said.\n\nThe bill's co-sponsor, Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, said \"millions of LGBTQ families ... are worried about the Supreme Court's intention to rip away more freedoms.\"\n\nSome Republicans called the marriage legislation a pre-election political stunt to protect rights that are not endangered.\n\n\"This bill is just another superfluous exercise. This bill is completely unnecessary,\" Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., said on the House floor.\n\n\"People have the right to live their lives the way they want,\" Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., told Axios. Bacon said he is \"inclined to want to vote for the bill,\" but called it a \"game vote that's just trying to divide\" Republicans.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., explained her decision to join 46 other Republicans in voting to approve the measure in a post on Twitter.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of marriage, having done it a few times. And if gay couples want to be as happily or miserably married as straight couples, more power to them. Trust me on this,\" she wrote.\n\nBesides guaranteeing marriage equality at the federal level, the bill would also repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, known as DOMA.\n\nThe 1996 law was signed by former President Bill Clinton and defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman before the Supreme Court later ruled the Constitution guarantees same-sex marriage rights.\n\nIn last month's concurring opinion overturning Roe vs. Wade, Justice Clarence Thomas said the court should reconsider opinions protecting same-sex relationships, marriage equality and access to contraceptives, prompting Democrats to introduce new bills to codify those rights.\n\nDespite passing the Democratic-led House Tuesday, it is not clear whether the Respect for Marriage Act will get through the Senate where the parties are split 50-50. Conservatives in the Senate are expected to argue individual states should determine their own laws on same-sex marriage.\n\nA similar bill, currently under debate in the House, would codify federal rights to access safe birth control. The Protecting Access to Contraception Act was introduced earlier this month after Roe vs. Wade was overturned.\n\n\"As this Court may take aim at other fundamental rights, we cannot sit idly by as the hard-earned gains of the Equality movement are systematically eroded,\" Nadler said.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Left Spreads Fear: Overturning Roe Means Ending Interracial Marriage\n\nSupporters of Roe v. Wade are spreading fears that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's draft decision overturning the landmark abortion case would mean that other Court precedents, including interracial marriage, could also be canceled.\n\nMany commentators focused on a paragraph in the opening summary of the decision, which was published by Politico :\n\nHowever, they appear not to have read the entire opinion. As Breitbart News noted in a fact check, Justice Alito specifically distinguished abortion from all other cases - including Loving v. Virginia (1967), which struck down Jim Crow laws against interracial marriage - since of these issues, only abortion involves the potential taking of what might be a human life:\n\nWhat sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both these decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call \"potential life\" and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an \"unborn human being.\" See Roe, 410 U.S., at 159 (abortion is \"inherently different\"); Casey, 505 U.S., at 852 (abortion is a \"unique act\"). None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.\n\n...\n\nAnd to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to case doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion\n\nOne of the conservative justices who apparently joined Alito's opinion is Clarence Thomas, who is in an interracial marriage.\n\nJoel B.

      "text": "New York Times Continues the Fear: Overturning Roe Means Ending Interracial Marriage\n\nThe New York Times published a lead editorial on Sunday in which it warned that overturning Roe v. Wade , the landmark 1973 abortion law, would mean ending interracial marriage, repeating an erroneous argument the left has spread for days.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last week, some Democrats reacted to the leak of Justice Samuel Alito's draft decision by claiming that all other social rights were at risk if Roe were to be reversed, and states could even ban interracial marriage.\n\nBut Justice Alito specifically distinguished abortion from all other cases, because it involves a potential human life, adding : \"Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\"\n\nNevertheless, in an editorial titled \"America Is Not Ready for the End of Roe v. Wade,\" the Times argued :\n\nImagine that every state were free to choose whether to allow Black people and white people to marry. Some states would permit such marriages; others probably wouldn't. The laws would be a mishmash, and interracial couples would suffer, legally consigned to second-class status depending on where they lived.\n\nIt seems an unthinkable scenario in 2022. That's because in 1967 the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that barring interracial marriage, as 16 states still did , violates the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. \"Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the state,\" the court stated in Loving v. Virginia .\n\nThe Times tried to argue that letting states set their own policies would lead to chaos. But it did not point out that the Supreme Court's decisions on interracial marriage and other discrimination issues involved the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which was not the basis for the \"right to privacy\" found in the \"penumbra\" of the Constitution to legalize abortion.\n\nNotably, the Times editorial board has not similarly criticized \"sanctuary\" cities and states for dissenting on immigration law.\n\nJoel B.

It would take another 15 years, until 2011, for support to reach the majority level,\" according to the poll report. \"Then in 2015, just one month before the U.S. Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision, public support for legalizing gay marriage cracked the 60 percent level. In 2021, it reached the 70 percent mark for the first time and has been there each of the past three years.\"\n\nPeople gather in Washington's Lafayette Park to see the White House illuminated with rainbow colors to mark the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling to legalize same-sex marriage, June 26, 2015.

The report specified that majorities of all but two key subgroups - Republicans (49 percent) and weekly church goers (41 percent) - say gay marriages should be legally recognized.\n\nRepublican support for same-sex marriage has waffled around 50 percent since 2020 and reached slim majorities in 2021 and 2022. As for weekly church goers, Gallup News found that they are also more supportive of same-sex marriage than they have been in the past, but their level of support has remained steady since 2018.\n\nA same-sex couple holds their marriage license after they were married at San Francisco City Hall June 17, 2008, in San Francisco, California.

      "text": "Pollak: Democrats' Virtue Signaling Marriage, Contraception Bills Put Religious Liberty at Risk\n\nDemocrats are passing House bills on same-sex marriage and contraception that guard against an illusory threat from the Dobbs case, while posing a real threat to religious liberty, as suggested by a close reading of the texts of the various bills.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) lauded the new bills Thursday in the wake of last month's Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , which overturned the Roe v. Wade (1973) abortion precedent.\n\nThe Dobbs decision holds that there is no federal constitutional right to abortion, and returns the issue to state legislatures. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, explicitly stated that the holding applied to abortion, and not other rights.\n\nHowever, President Joe Biden and his party have claimed that the Dobbs decision places other rights guaranteed by the Court - including access to contraception, same-sex marriage, and even interracial marriage - at risk of being overturned.\n\nThey have cited a concurring opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas in which he states that the Court's other precedents on \"substantive due process\" - the doctrine on which Roe was based - should be revisited in light of the holding in Dobbs .\n\nHowever, as Breitbart News noted in a fact check , Thomas accepted that Dobbs applied only to abortion, and did not say that other rights should be overturned - only that they should be placed on a different basis other than \"substantive due process.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the House passed Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY)'s \"Respect for Marriage Act,\" which purports to defend same-sex marriage - which has been guaranteed by the Court since 2015 - from future attack by codifying it at the federal level. 47 Republicans joined Democrats in passing that bill, and it may have enough Republican votes in the Senate to pass as well.\n\nOn Thursday, the House, with eight Republican votes, passed a bill by Rep. Kathy Manning (D-NC) to guarantee access to contraception, which Democrats have claimed for more than ten years, without evidence, is under threat from Republicans.\n\nIn Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014), the Supreme Court held that private employers could exclude contraceptives from health insurance policies due to religious objections, though that case involved an objection to contraceptives that also induce abortion (abortifacients), not to contraceptives in general, which there is no effort by Republicans to restrict.\n\nBoth of these laws are a form of \"virtue signaling\" to rally Democrats in the wake of the Dobbs case, and in the wake of the Democrat-run Congress's failure to codify Roe , though same-sex marriage and contraception access are the law of the land.\n\nBoth laws also place Republicans in a tough political bind. By voting against legislation that has little more than a political purpose, they risk being labeled as \"against LGBT equality\" or \"against contraception\" in midterm election ads this fall.\n\nHowever, both laws are raising concerns among social conservatives because of the threat they could pose to religious liberty. The Supreme Court has carefully balanced personal rights with religious liberty; Democrats' new laws do not.\n\nThe \" Respect for Marriage Act ,\" for example, says that state law will be honored but makes no mention of religious liberty, or the freedom of religious institutions to make their own rules regarding which marriages they will approve.\n\nWorse, Manning's bill on contraception explicitly states : \"this Act supersedes and applies to the law of the Federal Government and each State government ... notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.\"\n\nManning's bill appears to be written explicitly to challenge the Supreme Court's finding in Hobby Lobby - that \"methods of contraception that violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the companies' owners\" infringe upon religious liberty.\n\nThus, Democrats are using a contrived panic over the implications of the Dobbs ruling not only to mobilize their base, but also to roll back statutory protections for religious liberty that have frustrated them in the past.\n\nRepublicans may fear being cast as troglodytes or religious zealots. But the reason to oppose these laws is clear: they exploit liberal outrage over the loss of abortion \"rights\" to erode the explicit right to religious liberty provided by the Constitution.\n\nJoel B.

Boy, that ought to make your gay friends nervous because we don't have a long history of protecting equal marriage. We don't have a long history of protecting interracial marriage. We don't have a long history of protecting access to contraception.

      "text": "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson Says Child Sex Change Bans Are 'Sort Of The Same Thing' As Interracial Marriage Bans\n\n(Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for The Atlantic)\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson compared child sex change bans to interracial marriage prohibitions on Wednesday.\n\nJackson made the remarks during a hearing for United States v. Skrmetti , a case considering whether Tennessee's law banning medical procedures intended to enable \"minor[s] to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex,\" violates the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. She likened the current issue to the 1967 Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court case that reversed Virginia's rule barring interracial marriage. (RELATED: Private Footage Reveals Leading Medical Org's Efforts To 'Normalize' Gender Ideology)\n\nLISTEN:\n\n\"What was most interesting about the potential comparison to Loving is that in that case everyone seemed to concede up front that a racial classification was being drawn by the statute. That was sort of like the starting point,\" Jackson said. \"The question was whether it was discriminatory because it applied to both races and it wasn't necessarily invidious or whatever. But you know, as I read ... the case here, you know, the court starts off by saying that Virginia is now one of sixteen states which prohibited and punishes marriages on the basis of racial classifications.\"\n\n\"And when you look at the structure of that law, it looks in terms of ... you can't do something that is inconsistent with your own characteristics, it's sort of the same thing,\" she continued. \"So it's interesting to me that we now have this different argument. And I wonder whether Virginia could have gotten away with what they did here by just making a classification argument, the way that Tennessee is in this case.\"\n\nThe Virginia law referenced by Jackson solely banned interracial marriages that involved white individuals, former Chief Justice Earl Warren noted in the court's decision to strike down the prohibition.\n\n\"There can be no question but that Virginia's miscegenation statutes rest solely upon distinctions drawn according to race,\" he wrote, later adding, \"The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures designed to maintain White Supremacy.\"\n\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Tennessee ban in September 2023, asserting that transgender individuals are not a \"politically powerless\" or \"immutable\" group.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "This Week Marks 50 Years Since The Supreme Court Ruled In Favor Of Interracial Marriage. Here Are 5 Stats Showing How Much Things Have Changed.\n\nMonday marked the 50th anniversary of the historic Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia that ruled that laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional. Despite the Black Lives Matter narrative that white supremacy is pervasive throughout society, statistics from the Pew Research Center show that over the past 50 years Americans have become much more tolerant toward interracial marriage.\n\nHere are five statistics showing how much things have changed in 50 years.\n\n1. In 1967, 3% of all newlyweds were interracial couples. In 2015, that number is 17%. Pew breaks it down further:\n\nThe most dramatic increases in intermarriage have occurred among black newlyweds. Since 1980, the share who married someone of a different race or ethnicity has more than tripled from 5% to 18%. White newlyweds, too, have experienced a rapid increase in intermarriage, with rates rising from 4% to 11%. However, despite this increase, they remain the least likely of all major racial or ethnic groups to marry someone of a different race or ethnicity.\n\nAsian and Hispanic newlyweds are by far the most likely to intermarry in the U.S. About three-in-ten Asian newlyweds (29%) did so in 2015, and the share was 27% among recently married Hispanics. For these groups, intermarriage is even more prevalent among the U.S. born: 39% of U.S.-born Hispanic newlyweds and almost half (46%) of U.S.-born Asian newlyweds have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity.\n\n2. In 1980, only 3% of all marriages were interracial couples. That number became 10% in 2015. In other words, the number of people who were married to a person of a different race increased from three million in 1980 to 11 million in 2015.\n\n3. Those who think that interracial marriage is bad for society declined from 13% to 9% from 2010 to 2017. Over the same period, those who think it's good for society increased from 24% to 39% and those who said it didn't really change society declined from 61% to 52%.\n\n4. The percentage of Americans who are opposed to their family members marrying someone from a different race declined from 31% in 2000 to 10% today. It is worth noting that there was an increase from 9% to 16% from 2002 to 2008 but after 2008 the number has \"fallen steadily,\" according to Pew.\n\n5. The percentage of non-black Americans who were opposed to a member of their family marrying a black person vastly declined from 63% in 1990 to 14% currently. Among other races the statistics showed:\n\nIn 2000, one-in-five non-Asian adults said they would be opposed to a close relative marrying an Asian person, and a similar share of non-Hispanic adults (21%) said the same about a family member marrying a Hispanic person. These shares have dropped to around one-in-ten for each group in 2016.\n\nAmong nonwhite adults, the share saying they would be opposed to a relative marrying a white person stood at 4% in 2016, down marginally from 7% in 2000 when the GSS first included this item.\n\nThe Pew statistics clearly demonstrate that the number of interracial marriages have increased over time while tolerance toward them has increased as well, showing that America truly is a more harmonious, peaceful society than the Left portrays it to be.\n\nFollow Aaron Bandler on Twitter.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

I'm thinking in particular about Loving,\" Brown said, referencing the 1967 Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia , which resulted in the overturning of the law prohibiting interracial marriage. The Justice added that she sees \"parallels\" as to \"how this statute operates and how the anti-miscegnation statutes in Virginia operated.\"\n\n🚨INSANE\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson strains to compare U.S. v.

      "text": "How A Single Word Is Poised To Play Havoc With Virginia's Laws, Culture\n\nBad ideas-especially those enshrined in the constitution-have victims.\n\nHow much difference can one word make? Some Virginia legislators seem curiously eager to find out-and if they do, the people of the commonwealth may be worse for the experiment. Senate Joint Resolution 249 (and its House counterpart, H.J. 9) is now working its way through the state's General Assembly. If enacted by two consecutive legislatures and approved by the people, the proposed amendment would alter Virginia's constitution to say that any lawful marriage must be recognized by state and local officials without regard to sex, race, or-and here's that ominous word-\"gender.\"\n\nWhat's the difference between \"gender\" and \"sex?\" Well, the latter is fixed: a person is born and remains either a man or a woman. The former is fluid, distilled from the notion that one's sexual identification is somehow different from (and more important than) one's natural biology ... and can change sometimes even over the course of a day.\n\nAmending the state's foundational document to put gender in the same category as sex and race in issuing marriage licenses would be a radical step-and there are five reasons for state legislators to think twice before taking it, especially now during National Marriage Week.\n\nLook at some of the biggest cultural issues in America today: men in women's sports, school officials withholding information from parents about their child's gender confusion, and activists pushing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for children. These were born out of legally separating sex from gender identity. Bad ideas-especially those enshrined in the constitution-have victims. And more often than not, it's our children who suffer the most.\n\nAdding \"gender\" to the Virginia Constitution could give these judges a basis for pushing a more comprehensive constitutional embrace of \"gender\" and potentially block legislators from passing laws that accurately reflect the distinctions between women and men.\n\nThe sponsors of this resolution profess concern that rights to interracial and same-sex marriage might somehow be taken away. But both are already protected by federal law: Interracial marriage was settled by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Loving decision (1967); same-sex unions were affirmed in the high court's Obergefell ruling (2015). What's more, the Virginia General Assembly passed a law last year virtually identical to the one in question. What they want this amendment to do has already been done-and the legislators pushing this resolution have to know that. Which means ...\n\nIf these legislators are-as they claim-only worried about preserving same-sex marriage, they could have just added the word \"sex\" to their proposed amendment. A person's gender identity has never been the basis for holding back a marriage license. The whole argument for same-sex unions was to change the historic definition of marriage as the legal binding of two people of the opposite biological sex. Gender has never come into the discussion.\n\nWhat can the reason be for excising religious liberty guarantees from the proposed amendment? Those protections ensure that those who sincerely believe marriage is the sacred union of one man and one woman are not compelled to assist or participate in other celebrations of marriage. The religious protections that were part of that near-identical law passed last year drew significant ire from opponents during a hearing related to the bill and now have been eliminated from the language under consideration. There's no reason for that omission, apart from a deliberate intent to curtail religious freedom in regard to this issue.\n\nAll of which raises a lot of questions about the intentions of those sponsoring this far-reaching resolution. And those concerns give Virginians who value the rights, health, and safety of women-of engaged and caring parents wanting the best for their children-and of conscientious people of faith-a lot of reasons to look closely at Senate Joint Resolution 249 and its House companion. One word, carefully placed, could bring a great deal of unwanted change to Virginia. Here's hoping a word to the wise is timely enough to change that.\n\n* * *\n\nGregory S.

      "text": "Study: Most Minorities Have Experienced Little To No Discrimination In America\n\nThe Left likes to promulgate the notion that white supremacy is rampant in America and is a major barrier to minorities advancing in society. That narrative has been skewered by a recent study showing that most minorities have experienced little to no discrimination in America.\n\nA group of researchers conducted interviews of minorities at four different parts of their lives asking them about how often they experienced \"perceived discrimination\" and what they attributed that discrimination to. The result: 75% of minorities surveyed claimed the frequency of discrimination was in the \"never\" or \"rarely ever\" categories.\n\nHere is the breakdown among racial demographics that did claim to experience discrimination: ( H/T: Campus Reform )\n\nAlthough racial minorities did comparatively report facing more discrimination, racial disparities were not nearly as high as expected, with only 31 percent of blacks reporting experiencing discrimination \"sometimes\" or \"often.\"\n\nSimilarly, just 27 percent of Hispanics responded similarly, followed by 23 percent of whites, and 18 percent of Asians, according to the study.\n\n\"Discrimination owing to race/ ancestry/skin color was the most commonly reported cause (around 10%), and was followed closely by economic/educational factors (around 9%), and age (around 7%),\" the study states.\n\nThe study cautions that there were \"limitations\" with their survey.\n\n\"First, not all racial and ethnic groups represented in the United States were included in the sample,\" the study states. \"Second, the measure of discrimination included in the Add Health data was quite broad and could capture acts that were not necessarily discriminatory but rather unfair in nature. In turn, such a conceptualization on the part of respondents could be one reason for the preponderance of the other category as a perceived reason for the discrimination (or unfair) experience.\"\n\nThe study also noted that some respondents may have forgotten certain instances of discrimination.\n\nResearcher Brian Boutwell, who headed the study, told Campus Reform that while his study's results were \"interesting,\" there were \"still millions of people\" who claimed to have experienced discrimination and that \"more research needs to be done\" on the matter.\n\nRead the full study here.\n\nThe results from the study are buttressed by other research showing discrimination is on the decline, such as findings showing an increase in tolerance for interracial marriage over the past 50 years . The fact is that while there are still individual instances of racism in America, the country is not a bastion of intolerance as the Left would have you believe, as highlighted by the study showing that most minorities have experienced little to no discrimination in America.\n\nFollow Aaron Bandler on Twitter.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "For The Left, Children Are Either Obstacles Or Tools\n\nIn the aftermath of a leaked Supreme Court draft majority decision prospectively overruling Roe v. Wade, the Left in the United States has gone into full-fledged panic mode. That outsized panic has manifested as a variety of unconvincing or blatantly immoral arguments: the argument that abortion is a necessary adjunct to women's freedom - as though contraception doesn't exist, and as though women are never responsible for their own sexual decisions and the consequences thereof; the argument that unless society provides for any number of government programs, abortion should not be prohibited - as though the solution to lack of universal child care is the death of the child; the argument that conservatives will next attempt to outlaw interracial marriage - an absurd slander on its face.\n\nUnderlying all of this is a perverse and inverted view of children's role in society. To the Left, children in the womb are utterly disposable; at best, women may choose to preserve their lives, but if not, they have no separate interests to be considered. In fact, children are to be treated as potential obstacles: as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said this week, \"access to reproductive health care, including abortion, helped lead to increased labor force participation; it enabled many women to finish school. That increased their earning potential.\" This explains why the Left has now embraced the language of \"forced birth\" to describe laws protecting the unborn: pregnancy is no longer seen as the possible biological outgrowth of sexual activity, but as a dramatic foreign imposition on women. The default, for the Left, is childlessness; pregnancy is somehow unnatural. Thus, the entire Democratic Party apparatus now refuses to countenance even the mildest restrictions on abortion all the way to the point of birth.\n\nOnce children are born, the Left then sees them as sources of grief and pain for their parents. This, too, cuts in favor of abortion. As former President Barack Obama once stated about his daughters, \"if they make a mistake, I don't want them punished with a baby.\" Babies are life-sucking entities, depriving women of opportunity and freedom. Which explains why the Left has now embraced the argument that unless government somehow relieves parents of their responsibility to raise and care for their own children, abortion ought to be broadly available.\n\nAs children grow, the Left sees them as the center of recruitment efforts on behalf of their favored politics. Children should be indoctrinated in the ideas of racial essentialism and historic guilt, so as to turn them into political widgets on behalf of utopian social change; children should be confused about the nature of biological sex and gender, so as to justify the sexual attitudes of narcissistic adults. Hence the Left's outsized rage at Florida's Parental Rights in Education bill, which merely banned sexual orientation and gender theory indoctrination for children through third grade. As the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus sang in 2021, \"You think that we'll corrupt your kids, if our agenda goes unchecked. Funny, just this once, you're correct. We'll convert your children. Happens bit by bit.\" No wonder Joe Biden told teachers two weeks ago, \"They're all our children...They're not somebody else's children, they're like yours when they're in the classroom.\"\n\nAll of this is fundamentally indecent. Adulthood lies in one primary task: protecting and defending children. This means bearing children is a gift, not an obstacle; this means that children should not be treated as autonomous adults while adults escape responsibility for their own decisions. This means raising children in line with values that ensure their stability and happiness - even if that means a tougher life for adults. All of that begins with a basic supposition the Left refuses to countenance: that they are not the center of creation, but that their children ought to be.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "The 'Respect For Marriage Act' Disrespects Faithful Americans\n\nThe legislation puts small business owners at risk of fines and imprisonment for declining participation in a same-sex wedding celebration.\n\nThe U.S. Senate has begun debate on a same-sex marriage bill they call the \"Respect for Marriage Act,\" and senators are expected to cast a final vote on the legislation when they return after Thanksgiving. Proponents dubiously claim this bill provides religious liberty and conscience protection. They're also making a contrived argument that the legislation is necessary to protect interracial marriage.\n\nIn its 1967 decision, Loving v. Virginia , the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a state ban on interracial marriage because it was in clear violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the 14th Amendment. The court rightfully struck a blow against racial discrimination, but its decision did not alter the nationwide consensus that marriage is a union of one man and one woman.\n\nToday - 55 years after the court's historic Loving decision - not one legislative body in any state of America is considering legislation to ban interracial marriage. While we're not professional gamblers, we estimate that the odds are less than 1 in 100 trillion that any state in America will ever ban interracial marriage or that the U.S. Supreme Court would uphold such a ban in the infinitesimal chance it was placed on their docket. We further estimate that about 99 percent of Americans agree with our prediction and that a comparable percentage would be appalled if any state ever brought such a racist proposal to a vote.\n\nDespite knowing that the banning of interracial marriage anywhere in America is a near impossibility, members of Congress are sowing fear across America and seeking to exploit the politically contrived argument that interracial marriage is at risk. This diversion seeks to distract the American people and their fellow legislators from the true goal - advancing legislation that puts photographers, wedding planners, and other small business owners or contractors at risk of severe fines, imprisonment, and bankruptcy if they dare to decline participation in a same-sex wedding celebration due to their sincerely held religious beliefs.\n\nHaving manufactured the argument that interracial marriage is at risk, proponents of the \"Respect for Marriage Act\" now argue it is necessary to pass this legislation in order to alleviate the fear they have sown with their cynical political tactic.\n\nIn crafting this bill, sponsors have created a new legal standard that will punish Americans who \"cling\" to their religious beliefs despite the new orthodoxy about marriage. Photographers and other entrepreneurs who don't bend to the will of leftist activists will be treated as if they are racist bigots who refuse to provide a service to fellow Americans based on the color of their skin. The faithful entrepreneurs will effectively be presumed guilty of marriage discrimination and will have a high legal bar to clear in seeking to prove their innocence.\n\nThe Biden administration is showing how legal tools in the arsenal of radical appointees can be turned against everyday Americans. The U.S. Justice Department, which would receive enhanced enforcement power under this legislation, has abused a federal law that criminalizes peaceful protests in front of abortion facilities by sending a swarm of armed agents to the home of a peaceful anti-abortion protester despite the fact that local law enforcement found no reason to charge the person with a crime. That individual now faces the prospect of severe penalties and years of imprisonment because the Biden administration is determined to crush any organization or individual that stands in the way of a single abortion being performed in America at any point in pregnancy for any reason.\n\nThe same Biden Justice Department has labeled parents protesting at school board meetings as domestic terrorists and has conspired with social media companies to deny the First Amendment rights of Americans. This Justice Department cannot be trusted with enhanced authority to prosecute and delegitimize faithful Americans who respect other people's beliefs and just want to be left alone and allowed to exercise their beliefs outside the doors of a church - even as they seek to support their families through a local photography business or other enterprise that sometimes provides wedding services in their communities.\n\nConservative senators who have voted to advance the \"Respect for Marriage Act\" will have another chance to protect their faithful constituents when they return to the U.S. Capitol after Thanksgiving. While we believe this legislation is completely unnecessary and that it purports to address a threat that doesn't exist, we also believe it will cause real harm in its present form.\n\nAt a minimum, conservative senators from America's heartland should insist that the legislation have airtight protections for nonprofit organizations and social service providers (e.g., adoption, foster care), as well as for small business owners and contractors.\n\nBiden has proved to be a Trojan horse for the radical left, and his aspiring successors from California, among others, are even more radicalized than he is. No responsible legislator should hand them another cudgel that can be used to destroy the livelihoods and reputations of our fellow Americans.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "The New York Times Needs To Get Over Its White Supremacy Fetish\n\nWe used to think of interracial marriage as a sign of social progress. Now, thanks to The New York Times , we know it's just another sinister tool of white supremacy.\n\nOver the past few years, it seems like every week our media-academia complex discovers a new addition to the list of \"things that seem completely innocuous but are actually white supremacist.\" In recent months, for example, we've learned that math , logic , and even square dancing are \"weapon[s] of white supremacy.\" (You should feel a pang of guilt for every time you do-si-doed in elementary school.)\n\nHere's their latest hot take: in a recent essay for the New York Times Sunday Review , journalist Audrea Lim argues that \"the white supremacists on the far right have 'yellow fever' - an Asian woman fetish.\" Her evidence boils down to a few anecdotes about the worst-of-the-worst of white nationalism: perennial idiot Richard Spencer thinks Asian girls are \"cute\" and \"smart,\" Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin went to a shopping mall with his Filipina girlfriend, and Asian-American porn star Tila Tequila once did a Nazi salute.\n\nTo bolster her argument with historical context, Lim even includes a direct quote from Adolf Hitler expressing his admiration for the civilizations of China and Japan. Pro tip: when you're quoting Hitler, you're losing the argument.\n\nCertainly, there is a stock character in American life of the lonely, socially awkward, middle-aged white man who wants a \"submissive Asian wife.\" A feature-length PBS documentary even follows one of these sad sacks in his quest to find a mail-order bride from China. It's pathetic and trades in racial stereotypes, but that hardly makes it \"white supremacist.\" In fact, Lim provides no evidence that this phenomenon is even unique to white men, which begs the question: is it really true that white men have an \"Asian fetish\"?\n\nLim doesn't say, but thankfully, we can find detailed statistical information through a simple Google search. According to research by the dating site OkCupid , American men of all racial backgrounds find Asian women highly attractive. In fact, Asian-American women are the only racial group to score net positive ratings from men of all ethnic groups.\n\nIf you think about it, Lim's argument is bizarre. If someone told me Italians were the most handsome, creative, and intelligent people in the world, I would click my heels, praise their good sense, and go about my day. But rather than appreciate the fact that Asian-American women are considered highly attractive, Lim sees only a sneaking racial bias, a reflection of our upside-down cultural world where victimhood and oppression carry more social currency than even beauty and success.\n\nMore deeply, however, Lim's argument is that the very idea that Asians are \"civilized, advanced and highly intelligent ... [has] roots in white supremacy.\" Really? I worked as a journalist in China for more than a year, and it was clear to me that the Chinese think of themselves as civilized, advanced, and highly intelligent. If anything, it's a self-identity that has been accepted, not invented, by the West.\n\nFurthermore, in America, that positive image is a factual reality. Asian-Americans have higher median income and education levels than any other racial group does. Contra Lim, Asian-Americans are not a \"model minority,\" they're model citizens with strong family bonds, high educational attainment, and high economic productivity . There's nothing wrong with that - in fact, it's a major accomplishment to celebrate.\n\nUnfortunately, while the essay sets up the premise that white supremacy lurks at the heart of the relationships between white men and Asian women, it fails to deliver a conclusion. I'll fill it in for you. If we take Lim's argument to its logical end (and reject the idea that logic itself is \"white supremacist\"), maybe she's suggesting that white men who marry Asian women are, in the language of the sociological literature, \"colonizing their bodies.\"\n\nOr maybe white men are simply using their privilege as the progenitors of global beauty standards to extend their patriarchal dominance over a favored minority race. Or, to read into Lim's ominous invocation of Hitler, maybe it's all a secret plot to resurrect the Axis alliance between the great European and Asian powers. Of course, the author doesn't go this far - her essay is ridiculous enough - but there's no way you can accept her premise without concluding at the very least that interracial marriage between white men and Asian women is somehow wrong.\n\nI take this insinuation personally. I'm a white man married to an Asian-American woman. We have two children together. Like the civil rights leaders in the 1960s, I believe interracial marriage is a sign of social progress. At its best, marriage is about human love, which transcends all considerations of race, class, and identity. One might even consider it to be the fullest expression of the idea of e pluribus unum , which I support by any means necessary - through assimilation, marriage, and the bonds of mutual citizenship.\n\nWhile there may be awkward moments as we traverse the boundaries of ethnic identity, I believe that interracial marriage makes us stronger as a nation and will slowly help stamp out the real racism that still exists in America. Rather than conflate interracial marriage with the poisonous ideology of white supremacy, we should celebrate it as it's practiced by millions of Americans: as an expression of love, unity, and tolerance.\n\nUltimately, the best way to defeat the idea of white supremacy is to ignore cartoon villains like Spencer and Anglin. They're bigots, losers, and attention-seekers who survive on the oxygen the media gives them. They're a miniscule fraction of the population - numbering in the thousands in a nation of 323 million - and deserve to be snubbed out of public life.\n\nSadly, articles like \"white supremacists have an Asian fetish\" are counterproductive, bringing them even greater attention and trivializing the real legacy of white supremacy, the original sin of American history. The New York Times has a responsibility to exercise greater editorial discretion, rather than publish racially charged clickbait. In the past year, the Times has published articles about a white supremacist's wedding registry , whether black and white preschoolers can really be friends , and how \"nachos\" and \"Nazi\" share the same etymological origin . The coverage has been so over-the-top, you might even say The New York Times has a \"white supremacy fetish.\"\n\nLuckily, America is moving forward, with or without the Times . Interracial marriage is a fast-rising trend and leading to broader social tolerance. The percentage of multiracial children born in the United States has increased from 1 percent in 1970 to 10 percent in 2013. The social taboos against racial mixing have begun to fade and a majority of multiracial Americans are proud of their blended heritage and more open to other cultures.\n\nOn a final note of optimism: mixed-race people are actually seen as the most attractive of all racial types . Thus, if this trend continues, we may soon be able to say objectively that America has the most beautiful people in the world . That's something worth fighting for.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "The 'Respect For Marriage Act' Is An Exercise In Tyranny, And Everyone Knows It\n\nThe 12 Republicans who voted to advance the bill last week are gaslighting the American public about its real purpose.\n\nIt's not hard to game out what happens if the misnamed Respect for Marriage Act passes, codifying Obergefell and enshrining gay marriage in federal law. Everyone, including the dozen Republican senators who voted to advance the legislation last week, knows exactly what will happen. It's not some big mystery.\n\nWhat will happen is this: Christians, Jews, Muslims, and anyone else who dares maintain that marriage is a lifelong conjugal union between one man and one woman - the definition of marriage for thousands of years until the U.S. Supreme Court descended from Mount Sinai with Obergefell v. Hodges inscribed on stone tablets - will be branded a bigot and driven from the public square and marketplace.\n\nAnyone who owns a small business related to the wedding industry - photographers, bakers, website designers, venue owners, caterers, florists - will be sued into oblivion if they refuse services to same-sex couples. Religious colleges and universities will lose their tax-exempt status. Religious institutions of every kind, if they hold to their teachings and traditions about marriage, will face an onslaught from the Department of Justice and the federal bureaucracy.\n\nTo paraphrase George Orwell's famous line, if you want a picture of the future under the Respect for Marriage Act, imagine a boot stamping on Jack Phillips' face - forever.\n\nThe untrammeled exercise of power and the vigorous crushing of dissent is the entire purpose of the proposed law. There can be no other possible justification for it. Michael New, an assistant professor at the Busch School of Business at The Catholic University of America, recently told The Daily Signal that Catholic colleges and universities in particular might face ruinous lawsuits and loss of federal funding if the bill is signed into law.\n\n\"Suppose a Catholic college refused to allow a same-sex married couple to live in college owned graduate student housing for families, they might be subject to all kinds of litigation,\" he said. \"Such a college might lose its nonprofit status. Their students might lose eligibility for federal financial aid and their faculty might lose eligibility from research grants from government agencies.\"\n\nWell, yes. Of course all that would happen. Democrats and left-wing activists hear these kinds of concerns from people like New and think, \"Good. Let them face ruinous litigation. Let them lose funding. Ghettoize them. Crush them. Grind their institutions into dust. They deserve it, the bigots.\"\n\nAll the more appalling, then, that 12 Republican senators voted to advance the bill knowing full well what it will do. One wishes the explanation is just that these lawmakers are too stupid to understand what the purpose of the proposed law really is and what its effect will obviously be, but that's wishful thinking.\n\nIf they're going to support this bill, though, do they have to pretend that we're all too stupid to understand how it will work? Does Dan Sullivan, the second-worst U.S. senator from Alaska, who once supported a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in the long-ago of 2014, really believe that the Respect for Marriage Act makes \"important advances\" in religious liberty?\n\nDoes Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who 10 years ago as speaker of the statehouse supported a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage in his state , really think the anemic amendments he and other GOP senators offered to the bill will \"advance religious freedom\" and \"age well\"?\n\nAll the Republicans who voted to advance the bill last week issued some version of the nonsense Sullivan and Tillis spouted. None of them believe a word of it. They just hope you buy it.\n\nBut you don't have to. Roger Severino of the Heritage Foundation helpfully walked through these specious claims one by one , explaining why they're wrong. No, the bill won't provide religious institutions with meaningful protections. Yes, the bill could certainly be used as a basis for the Internal Revenue Service to deny tax-exempt status to religious organizations that don't toe the line on gay marriage. Yes, it could also be used to deny grants, licenses, or contracts. No, weak language about preserving the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is not enough to prevent harm to religious liberty. And so on.\n\nThe justification for the bill is just as outlandish and offensive as the argument that it presents no danger to religious Americans. In the wake of the Dobbs decision this summer, we were warned that some future Supreme Court opinion, following Justice Clarence Thomas's logic, could overturn Obergefell and other substantive due process rulings such as Loving v. Virginia , which struck down state laws banning interracial marriage.\n\nThe purpose of this claim, in case it isn't bone-crushingly obvious, is to lump opponents of gay marriage in with opponents of interracial marriage, to smear them as bigots who aren't just on the wrong side of history, but who are about to be on the receiving end of a federal government empowered to go after them.\n\nAnd if you think that can't really be how proponents of the Respect for Marriage Act think about traditional-minded Americans, go ask Jack Phillips how he's faring after winning his Supreme Court case in 2018.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Barronelle Stutzman Shows Sexual Orientation Laws Treat Religious People Like Racists\n\nJust as we determine people's character by assessing their actions, the best way to evaluate the wisdom and purpose of a law is by considering its real-world effects. This month, laws adding sexual orientation to public-accommodation nondiscrimination statutes showed their true colors, and the picture wasn't pretty.\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court punished a 72-year-old grandmother named Barronelle Stutzman for declining to create custom floral arrangements to celebrate a longtime customer's same-sex wedding. One of the worst parts about the court's decision is its heavy-handedness: It found Barronelle personally liable and threatens to bankrupt her by requiring that she pay hundreds of thousands of dollars (if not more) to the American Civil Liberties Union attorneys who filed suit against her.\n\nMany proponents of these sexual-orientation laws say they're needed to ensure that businesses do not turn away customers because they identify as gay. This implies no business owner who serves gays and lesbians will be punished. But Barronelle's case proves that this isn't true.\n\nBarronelle happily serves everyone in her community, including LGBT citizens. In fact, she had served Rob Ingersoll-the customer who asked her to create the arrangements for his same-sex wedding-for almost a decade. Barronelle built a friendship with Rob, and even though he has sued and sought to bankrupt her, she continues to love him and wishes him the best to this very day.\n\nEven though Barronelle gladly serves her LGBT neighbors, her opponents insist that she violates the law because she refuses to provide services for same-sex couples who are marrying. It isn't accurate to say, however, that she refuses to serve those couples. She will sell premade arrangements or unarranged flowers for same-sex couples to use in their weddings. The sticking point for her is being required to use her artistic skills to create custom arrangements that celebrate same-sex marriages.\n\nBut according to the Washington Supreme Court's decision, sexual-orientation laws do not just require business owners like Barronelle to serve same-sex couples who are marrying; creative professionals must actually make artwork (in Barronelle's case, living sculptures) that celebrate those unions as marriages.\n\nWorse yet, sexual-orientation laws are designed to harshly affect people like Barronelle. They declare that individuals who distinguish same-sex marriage from man-woman marriage are engaged in a form of unlawful discrimination akin to racist actions, like refusing to provide service for an interracial wedding. They say that those who share Barronelle's views about marriage-a group that includes millions of Christians, Jews, and Muslims-should be treated like racists and ushered out of public life.\n\nBut it's unfair and dishonest to equate Barronelle to a person who opposes interracial marriage. Indeed, existing Supreme Court case law already recognizes that they are not the same. When the high court struck down bans on interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia , it said that those laws reflected \"invidious\" discrimination grounded only in odious notions of \"White Supremacy.\" In contrast, when the Supreme Court redefined marriage to include same-sex couples in Obergefell v. Hodges , the justices recognized that the belief that marriage is a gender-diverse union of husband and wife is based on \"decent and honorable premises\" and is held \"in good faith by reasonable and sincere people.\"\n\nThat belief is honorable not only because it is shared by most adherents of the Abrahamic faiths, but also because it is rooted in a biologically based truth about humanity (that every child has a mother and a father) and a laudable social goal (that society should encourage mothers and fathers to jointly raise their children in a stable family unit). Opposition to interracial marriage, however, engrafts racist ideas (that marriages should not be racially diverse) onto the institution of marriage solely for racist ends (to keep people of different races from procreating with each other). Nothing but bigotry permeates that view.\n\nLest there be any doubt, history proves that there is no comparing these views on marriage. Interracial-marriage bans were an historical aberration. They were unheard of in most places at most times, and even in our country existed only in some states. (For example, six of the 13 original colonies never outlawed interracial marriage). On the other hand, the understanding that marriage is the union of husband and wife has prevailed throughout all of human history until approximately 15 years ago. Its ubiquity spanned the globe and reached across cultures, including cultures that predated or were otherwise unfamiliar with Judeo-Christian beliefs.\n\nGiven the stark differences between these views on marriage, it is wrong for the government to treat their adherents the same. To be sure, the government may restrict many public actions rooted in invidious racism, but the government has no legitimate interest in punishing people who peacefully live out the timeless belief that marriage is a gender-diverse union. By failing to distinguish between these two very different things, sexual-orientation laws are built on a flawed foundation and will continually produce unjust outcomes.\n\nBarronelle's story is a case in point and shows us what an unjust law looks like. It punishes conscientious individuals who love and serve all people but cannot create art celebrating a particular event, and it punishes them by threatening to strip their life savings and home. It also equates \"decent and honorable\" beliefs with racism, driving the \"reasonable and sincere people\" who hold those beliefs to the margins of society.\n\nHow many more cases like Barronelle's will it take until good people from all walks of life begin to speak up and oppose the source of these grave injustices?\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "website": "https://thefederalist.com",
      "text": "Will Marriage Dissidents Be Treated As Bigots Or Pro-Lifers?\n\nWith its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges , the Supreme Court has brought the sexual revolution to its apex-a redefinition of our civilization's primordial institution, cutting its link to procreation and declaring sex differences meaningless. The court has usurped the authority of the people, working through the democratic process, to define marriage. And it has shut down debate just as we were starting to hear new voices-gay people who agree that children need their mother and their father, and children of same-sex couples who wish they knew both their mom and dad.\n\nIf the polls are right, there has also been an astonishingly swift change in public opinion. Most Americans now think that justice, equality, or at least good manners requires redesigning marriage to fit couples (and at this point, just couples) of the same sex. Or at least they've been intimidated into saying so.\n\nI argue in my just-released book, \" Truth Overruled: The Future of Marriage and Religious Freedom ,\" that we are sleepwalking into an unprecedented cultural and social revolution. A truth acknowledged for millennia has been overruled by five unelected judges. The consequences will extend far beyond those couples newly able to obtain a marriage license.\n\nIf our society teaches a falsehood about marriage, it is harder for people to live out the truth of marriage. Marital norms make no sense, as a matter of principle, if what makes a marriage is merely intense emotional feeling, an idea captured in the bumper-sticker slogan, \"Love makes a family.\" There is no reason that mere consenting adult love has to be permanent or limited to two persons, much less sexually exclusive. So, as people internalize this new vision of marriage, marriage will be less and less a stabilizing force.\n\nIf fewer people live out the norms of marriage, then fewer people will reap the benefits of the institution of marriage-not only spouses, but also children. Preserving the man-woman definition of marriage is the only way to preserve the benefits of marriage and avoid the enormous societal risks accompanying a genderless marriage regime. How can the law teach that fathers are essential, for instance, when it has officially made them optional?\n\nThe essence of marriage as a male-female union, however, has become an unwelcome truth. Indeed, a serious attempt is well under way to define opposition to same-sex marriage as nothing more than irrational bigotry. If that attempt succeeds, it will pose the most serious threat to the rights of conscience and religious freedom in American history.\n\nWill the defenders of marriage be treated like bigots? Will our society and our laws treat Americans who believe that marriage is the union of husband and wife as if they were the moral equivalent of racists?\n\nPerhaps not. Think about the abortion debate. Ever since Roe v. Wade , our law has granted a right to abortion. Yet, for the most part, pro-life citizens are not treated as though they are \"anti-woman\" or \"anti-health.\" Those are just slurs from extremists. Even those who disagree with the pro-life cause respect it and recognize that it has a legitimate place in the debate over public policy.\n\nAnd-this is crucial-it's because of that respect that pro-choice leaders generally respect the religious liberty and conscience rights of their pro-life fellow citizens. Until the insurance-coverage mandates imposed under Obamacare, at least, there was wide agreement that pro-life citizens shouldn't be forced by the government to be complicit in what they see as the evil of abortion. Pro-life taxpayers, for example, haven't been forced to fund elective abortions, and pro-life doctors haven't been forced to perform them.\n\nWill the same tolerance be shown to those who believe the truth about marriage? Will the government respect their rights of conscience and religious liberty? It doesn't look good. So far, the trend has been in the opposite direction. We must now work to reverse it.\n\nFor years, the Left's refrain has been that people who oppose same-sex marriage are just like people who opposed interracial marriage-and that the law should treat them as it treats racists. Indeed, The New York Times reported that while the amicus briefs filed with the Supreme Court in Obergefell were evenly divided between supporters and opponents of state marriage laws, no major law firm filed a brief in support of marriage as the union of a man and a woman. \"In dozens of interviews, lawyers and law professors said the imbalance in legal firepower in the same-sex marriage cases resulted from a conviction among many lawyers that opposition to such unions is bigotry akin to racism.\"\n\nSame-sex marriage advocates insist that the court's Obergefell ruling is not like Roe v. Wade , which engendered undying controversy, but like Loving v. Virginia , the universally accepted decision that struck down bans on interracial marriage-a decision now so uncontroversial that most Americans have never heard of it. If that is true, then anyone who opposes Obergefell is an irrational bigot-the moral and legal equivalent of a racist.\n\nBut, as I explain in my book , great thinkers throughout human history-and from every political community until about the year 2000- thought it reasonable and right to view marriage as the union of husband and wife. Indeed, this view of marriage has been nearly a human universal. It has been shared by the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim traditions; by ancient Greek and Roman thinkers not influenced by these religions; and by Enlightenment philosophers. It is affirmed by canon law as well as common and civil law.\n\nBans on interracial marriage, by contrast, were part of an insidious system of racial subordination and exploitation that denied the equality and dignity of all human beings and forcibly segregated citizens based on race. When these interracial marriage bans first arose in the American colonies, they were inconsistent not only with the common law of England but with the customs of every previous culture throughout human history.\n\nAs for the Bible, while it doesn't present marriage as having anything to do with race, it insists that marriage has everything to do with sexual complementarity. From the beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelation, the Bible is replete with spousal imagery and the language of husband and wife. One activist Supreme Court ruling cannot overthrow the truth about marriage expressed in faith, reason, and universal human experience.\n\nWe must now bear witness to the truth of marriage with more resolve and skill than ever before. We must now find ways to rebuild a marriage culture. The first step will be protecting our right to live in accordance with the truth. The key question, again, is whether the liberal elites who now have the upper hand will treat their dissenting fellow citizens as they treat racists or as they treat pro-lifers. While elites disagree with the pro-life position, most understand it. They can see why a pro-life citizen defends unborn life-so for the most part they agree government shouldn't coerce citizens into performing or subsidizing abortions. The same needs to be true for marriage. And we need to make it true by making the arguments in defense of marriage.\n\nIn January 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court created a constitutional right to abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton . Pro-lifers were told they had lost and the issue was settled. The law taught citizens that they had a new right, and public opinion quickly swung against pro-lifers by as much as a two-to-one margin. One after another, formerly pro-life public figures-Ted Kennedy, Jesse Jackson, Al Gore, Bill Clinton-\"evolved\" in their thinking to embrace the new social orthodoxy of abortion on demand. Pundits insisted that all young people were for abortion, and elites ridiculed pro-lifers for being on the \"wrong side of history.\"\n\nThe pro-lifers were aging, their children increasingly against them. The only people who continued to oppose abortion, its partisans insisted, were a few elderly priests and religious fundamentalists. They would soon die off and abortion would be easily integrated into American life and disappear as a disputed issue.\n\nBut courageous pro-lifers put their hand to the plow, and today we reap the fruits. My generation is more pro-life than my parents' generation. A majority of Americans support pro-life policies, more today than at any time since the Roe decision. More state laws have been enacted protecting unborn babies in the past decade than in the previous 30 years combined.\n\nWhat happened? The pro-life community woke up and responded to a bad court ruling. Academics wrote the books and articles making the scientific and philosophical case for life. Statesmen like Henry Hyde, Edwin Meese, and Ronald Reagan crafted policy and used the bully pulpit to advance the culture of life. Activists and lawyers got together, formed coalitions, and devised effective strategies. They faithfully bore witness to the truth.\n\nEverything the pro-life movement did needs to be done again, now on this new frontier of marriage. There are three lessons in particular to learn from the pro-life movement that I explore at length in \"Truth Overruled \":\n\nJust as the pro-life movement successfully rejected Roe v. Wade and exposed its lies about unborn life and about the U.S. Constitution, we must make it clear to our fellow citizens that Obergefell v. Hodges does not tell the truth about marriage or about our Constitution.\n\nThe pro-life movement accomplished this on at least three fronts. First, it ensured that pro-life doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and hospitals would never have to perform abortions or dispense abortion-causing drugs. Second, it won the battle-through the Hyde Amendment-to prevent taxpayer money from paying for abortions. Third, it made sure government could not discriminate against pro-lifers and pro-life organizations.\n\nPro-marriage forces need to do the same: Ensure that we have freedom from government coercion to lead our lives, rear our children, and operate our businesses and charities in accord with our beliefs-the truth-about marriage. Likewise, we must ensure that government does not discriminate against citizens or organizations because of their belief that marriage is the union of husband and wife.\n\nWe have to bear witness to the truth in a winsome and compelling way. The pro-life movement accomplished this on different levels. Specialists in science, law, philosophy, and theology laid the foundations of the pro-life case with research and writing in their disciplines, while advocacy groups tirelessly appealed to the hearts of the American people. Pro-lifers did much more than preach, launching a multitude of initiatives to help mothers in crisis pregnancies make the right choice.\n\nNow we must employ reason to make the case for the truth about marriage, communicate this truth to our neighbors, and embody this truth in our families and communities. Just as the pro-life movement discovered the effectiveness of ultrasound and letting women speak for themselves, the pro-marriage movement will, I predict , find the social science on marriage and parenting and voices of the victims of the sexual revolution to be particularly effective. Just as grassroots pregnancy centers exposed the lie that abortion is a compassionate response to unplanned pregnancy, we must show what a truly loving response is to same-sex attraction.\n\nIn \" Truth Overruled ,\" I explain, in clear and sober terms, the enormous task before us of defending our families, churches, schools, and businesses from opponents who now wield coercive power in government, commerce, and academia. My goal is to equip everyone, not just the experts, to defend what most of us never imagined we'd have to defend: our rights of conscience, our religious liberty, and the basic building block of civilization-the human family, founded on the marital union of a man and a woman.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Defenders Of Traditional Marriage Should Follow The Pro-Life Playbook\n\nTraditional marriage advocates must shift tactics. We must make heart-changing, pro-marriage arguments based on the rights of children.\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling on the Dobbs case overturning Roe vs. Wade was the most refreshing and long-fought conservative culture war win in our lifetime. The pro-life activists responsible for this victory have established the path by which campaigns for social change must be patterned. That's especially true for those still willing to fight the battle for marriage.\n\nThere are myriad similarities between the 1973 SCOTUS decision legalizing abortion, and their 2015 ruling legalizing gay marriage. Both decisions inflicted severe damage on the fundamental rights of children. Roe violates a child's right to life. Obergefell is a subversive violation of a child's right to their mother and father.\n\nMany conservatives fail to ride the \"love is love\" thought train to the redefinition of parenthood station. Before Obergefell , marriage and parenthood laws, almost exclusively, related to the well-being of children. In fact, the only reason the state has traditionally had any interest in marriage is that most marriages produce children. Without marriage, children are raised fatherless and experience lifelong struggles. Making men and women interchangeable in parenting results in the violation of a child's right to the two people responsible for their existence . Unfortunately, pro-traditional marriage advocates failed to establish this fighting Obergefell .\n\nBoth pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage arguments focus on adult desire. Feelings are centerstage in all pro-choice arguments - they're not ready to parent, abortion made their Golden Globe possible, and they've got a devastating prenatal diagnosis. Feelings drive the arguments for gay marriage as well, gay and lesbian adults suffering, their \"coming out\" backstory, desperately wanting a family, and their longing for a State-validated partnership.\n\nNecessarily, conversations around both issues eschewed focus from the children. Pro-abortionists disavow the humanity of the unborn, resorting to \"clump of cells\" talking points or \"reproductive healthcare\" euphemisms. Despite our amicus brief intended to draw the court's attention to the suffering of children with gay parents, Obergefell proponents successfully argued that \"marriage has nothing to do with kids.\"\n\nThese SCOTUS rulings were decided on the basis that adult desires are rights; mothers possess the \"right to choose,\" and LGBT folks have a \"right to marry.\" But when adult desire masquerades as a right, children are forced to sacrifice their legitimate rights.\n\nThe similarities of these two cases illustrate that those seeking to rebuild a flourishing marriage culture should follow the winning tactics of the pro-life movement.\n\nOur focus must be on children. Pro-lifers empathize with women in unplanned pregnancies, and they didn't allow adult feelings to take center stage, they always focused the conversation on the child. When faced with statements like, \"I'm not prepared to parent,\" the pro-life response was \"When does human life begin?\" Reorienting the conversation toward the child's right to life kept the spotlight on the real victim of bad personal and policy decisions.\n\nThe same is true for effective marriage arguments. Pre- Obergefell , the religious right wailed about the horrors gay marriage would inflict on ... them. \"We'd have to bake a cake, arrange flowers, or photograph a same-sex wedding!\" The threat to religious liberty is, of course, deadly serious, but religious adults are not the victims of Obergefell . Children are.\n\nIn the wake of Obergefell , most are loathe to even acknowledge that children should be raised by a mother and father. According to the political zeitgeist, such blasphemy would constitute discrimination. Thus, traditional marriage advocates must shift tactics, we must make heart-changing, pro-marriage arguments based on the rights of children. Those who want to restore a flourishing marriage culture must empathize with gay adults, those struggling in their marriage, or considering sperm donation in the absence of Mr. Right, while remaining focused on the fact a child's right to their mother and father supersedes an adult's sadness, struggles or loneliness.\n\nIf we are to see a Dobbs-like victory for marriage, we must become educated. It was the proliferation of hundreds of pro-life organizations which resulted in well-informed warriors capable of rebutting common pro-choice talking points like \"my body, my choice\" and \"it might be a human, but is it a person?\" counterpoints.\n\nThem Before Us is the only non-profit devoted to defending children's right to their mother and father. To win back public opinion and we need more organizations equipping pro-marriage warriors who are equally comfortable fielding questions like:\n\n\"Opposition to gay marriage is just like opposition to interracial marriage.\"\n\n\"If you really think family is so important then you must be against divorce.\"\n\n\"Kids don't need moms and dads, they just need to be safe and loved.\"\n\nProponents of both abortion and gay marriage often appeal to \"edge cases,\" outliers like rape and incest or, \"so you'd rather have a child languish in an orphanage than adopted by a gay couple ?\" A solid pro-life and pro-marriage response requires readiness to respond to the rare exception argument. Just as the one percent of rape cases do not negate a child's right to life, the slim instances of a same-sex couple being the only option for an adoption do not justify rewriting parenthood law.\n\nMost importantly, we need to follow the two-prong approach of changing hearts and changing laws . Pro-life advocates walked the walk when it came to supporting women in unplanned pregnancies. They changed hearts by volunteering at pregnancy resource centers and outdoing their liberal counterparts as adoptive and foster parents . They also had savvy legal minds searching for cracks in the law to limit pre-birth murder.\n\nSimilarly, the pro-traditional marriage crowd must change hearts by doing the hard work of keeping their own families intact, enfolding into their orbit the father-hungry neighbor boy with two moms, and proving that the pro-marriage position isn't grounded in animus by initiating a relationship with our LGBT neighbor. We also must incept creative legal action that will incentivize men to commit to the women they impregnate and thus restore the original function of the institution of marriage.\n\nAnd finally, enough with cowardice. Pro-lifers were so confident that they were fighting for the most vulnerable that they were willing to pay the social cost. The pro-marriage crowd has been cowed, whispering and apologizing for their position in fear of being labeled \"anti-gay\" if they speak up on Facebook or at Thanksgiving dinner. No victory for marriage is possible until we can clearly articulate that marriage is a social justice issue for children; that we are failing to defend children when we fail to defend marriage .\n\nThe one major difference between the pro-life fight and the pro-marriage fight is child victims of abortion didn't live to tell how they've been harmed. Child victims of bad marriage policy do. Their stories will be the most powerful tool in the fight to change hearts and change laws.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

His wife is Hispanic.\n\nIt wasn't enough for Wendy Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor of Texas, to claim that her opponent - who is wheelchair-bound - doesn't care about disabled people . Now she and her campaign are claiming that Abbott might also want to ban interracial marriage .\n\nThere's only one problem: Abbott's wife Cecilia is Hispanic .\n\nGreg Abbott won't say whether he'd defend an interracial marriage ban-troubling but not surprising from someone who defends a \"poll tax.\"\n\n- Wendy Davis (@WendyDavisTexas) October 20, 2014\n\nEven though nobody has ever accused the Wendy Davis campaign of having the slightest clue what it's doing, this particular line of attack is shocking in its incompetence. As the Texas Tribune wrote back in March :\n\nWhile Gov. Rick Perry is bowing out of Texas politics after an unprecedented three four-year terms in office, history could also be made if the Governor's Mansion stays home to a Republican. If Attorney General Greg Abbott wins his campaign to succeed Perry - and he is favored to do so - his wife would become the first Latina to be the first lady of Texas. Cecilia Phalen Abbott, 54, has been a regular at her husband's side as he travels across the state for his campaign. He often talks about how Abbott, the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants, has helped him embrace the culture of a growing number of Texans, though talk about her heritage has been part of the conflict during the campaign.\n\nThis new campaign tack from Wendy Davis - accusing the guy whose wife is Hispanic of maybe wanting to ban interracial marriage - was roundly mocked by pretty much everyone on Twitter within minutes of the attack going out.\n\nWendy Davis: Worst campaign ever or worst campaign ever? John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) October 20, 2014\n\nHow much money did Democrats give Wendy Davis, again? - Because she just accused Greg Abbott of wanting to ban his own marriage. Moe Lane (@moelane) October 20, 2014\n\n@Heminator We need to consider the possibility that Wendy Davis is a false flag operation by conservatives.

      "text": "No, Critical Race Theory Isn't About Teaching That 'Slavery Is Real'\n\nParents who oppose teaching critical race theory in schools have nothing against teaching America's checkered history of race relations.\n\nProminent voices continue to frame the debate over whether critical race theory (CRT) should be taught in schools as a debate over whether we should teach accurate racial history.\n\nA few days ago, in an interview with Time magazine, Harvard University researcher Donald Yacovone (author of \"Teaching White Supremacy: America's Democratic Ordeal and the Forging of Our National Identity\") said of the controversy: \"...one of the major reactions is this resistance to the teaching of the past. ... Slavery is real. Racial domination is real. But they're doing their best to deny it, to affirm the innocence of whiteness.\"\n\nThis is a strawman attack. Few Americans of any stripe or generation object to teaching about slavery and Jim Crow. The problem with CRT in schools is there's a lot more to it than just teaching America's checkered history of race relations, and it's this \"more\" that many parents are objecting to.\n\nFor starters, CRT is essentially postmodernism. Stephen Sawchuk, associate editor of Education Week, notes in a piece praising CRT that, \"Critical race theory emerged out of postmodernist thought.\"\n\nPostmodernism is the idea that there is no truth, no universal morality, and no reality except what we create. There are no facts because everything is socially constructed. According to the Encyclopedia Brittanica's entry on postmodernism, it dismisses as \"naive realism\" the idea that \"there is an objective natural reality.\"\n\nPostmodernism is the philosophical equivalent of a funhouse mirror. Anything can be changed, created, and thrown away; and any new narrative is no more or less true than other narratives; because there is no such thing as objective fact or objective reality.\n\nThis philosophy comes through clearly in the works of critical race theorists such as Robin DiAngelo and Ozlem Sensoy, who reject the idea of objective knowledge and the scientific method in their book, \" Is Everyone Really Equal? \"\n\nImportantly for American parents, postmodernism and CRT take careful aim at the Enlightenment values that America was founded on, including the idea that all humans are created equal.\n\nSawchuk points out how postmodernism (and by extension CRT), \"tends to be skeptical of the idea of universal values, objective knowledge, individual merit, Enlightenment rationalism, and liberalism.\"\n\nIn her classes on intersectionality (itself an offshoot of CRT), the late Kathryn Pauly Morgan, who was a University of Toronto professor of philosophy and co-founder of the feminist philosophy journal Hypatia, taught that people exist on 14 axes of privilege and oppression: from male to female, from white to non-white, from heterosexual to gay/lesbian, etc.\n\nThat is, a white male lives at the intersection of two types of privilege, a black female lives at the intersection of two types of oppression, and so on. As she described it, \"Privilege involves the power to dominate in systematic ways. ... Oppression involves the lived, systematic experience of being dominated by virtue of one's position on various particular axes.\"\n\nThis kind of teaching can help open our eyes to the experiences of people unlike us, but it can also function to create a hierarchy. In their bestselling book \"The Coddling of the American Mind,\" social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression President Greg Lukianoff point out, \"These interpretations of intersectionality teach people to see bipolar dimensions of privilege and oppression as ubiquitous in social interactions.\"\n\n\"More generally,\" they continue, \"what will happen to the thinking of students who are trained to see everything in terms of intersecting bipolar axes where one end of each axis is marked 'privilege' and the other is 'oppression'? Since 'privilege' is defined as the 'power to dominate' and to cause 'oppression,' these axes are inherently moral dimensions. The people on top are bad, and the people below the line are good.\" [emphasis in original]\n\nMaybe some parents are upset that critical race theory doesn't put white people on top. We suspect far more are angry at an ideology that puts any skin color on top, rather than treating them all as equals. That's a denial of the core American tenant espoused in the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created equal - and one that Americans of many generations fought to ultimately realize.\n\nBesides jettisoning a foundational American tenet, it's also important to note CRT isn't \"educational\" in the traditional sense.\n\nWhile CRT teaches students what to think, it's openly hostile toward approaches that teach students how to think. In fact, many CRT advocates explicitly reject the concept of critical thinking altogether.\n\nDr. Alison Bailey, the director of the Women's and Gender Studies Program at Illinois State University, spells out the logic :\n\n...the tools of the critical-thinking tradition (for example, validity, soundness, conceptual clarity) cannot dismantle the master's house: they can temporarily beat the master at his own game, but they can never bring about any enduring structural change (Lorde 1984, 112). They fail because the critical thinker's toolkit is commonly invoked in particular settings, at particular times to reassert power: those adept with the tools often use them to restore an order that assures their comfort.\n\nBailey's argument boils down to this: Some people can outthink us, and those people might have power; so if we're going to dismantle power structures (a key goal of CRT and postmodernism), then we need to reject critical thinking completely.\n\nApart from the bare-knuckle politics of all this and the argument's self-evident absurdity, is a tool really bad because it's used by those in power? It's not hard to see the problems of introducing these ideas in K-12 schools. Most parents want their kids to learn how to think. They might be justifiably wary of an ideology that teaches that critical thinking is bad because it doesn't bring about systemic change in society.\n\nIt's not just Bailey, it must be pointed out. Plenty of CRT advocates reject objectivism and Enlightenment rationalism. In their book \"Is Everyone Really Equal?,\" DiAngelo and Sensoy even take aim at  the scientific method: \"Critical Theory [the parent philosophy of critical race theory] developed in part as a response to this presumed superiority and infallibility of the scientific method....\"\n\nIf you reject the basic concepts of scientific inquiry and critical thinking, what are you left with? A strong focus on scholarship as activism, which filters down into pedagogy: CRT advocates often see their classrooms as incubators to raise a new generation to fight the system.\n\nMaybe parents who reject CRT being taught in schools are simply picking up on this. Perhaps they want their kids to be educated in how to think, instead of being indoctrinated and trained to be future social justice advocates.\n\nFinally, it's unlikely that the opposition to teaching CRT in schools actually comes from racism. Support for interracial marriage, often used as a proxy for race relations, is at an all-time high . Ninety-four percent of Americans approve of interracial marriage, including 93 percent of white Americans and 93 percent of Southerners (for context, when that question was first asked in 1958 the answer was 4 percent support across the board).\n\nWe're not saying race relations are perfect, and certainly, racism still exists in the United States. But many CRT advocates don't seem to realize that it's no longer 1960 and the vast majority of white Americans don't make decisions based on trying to maintain racial hierarchies. Parents oppose teaching CRT in schools, not because they're secretly hoping white supremacy becomes the law of the land again, but for a number of better reasons.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson compares sex changes for children to interracial marriage, activist ACLU attorney agrees\n\n\"So it's interesting to me that we now have this different argument and I wonder whether Virginia could have gotten away with what they did here by just making a classification argument the way Tennessee is in this case.\"\n\n\"So it's interesting to me that we now have this different argument and I wonder whether Virginia could have gotten away with what they did here by just making a classification argument the way Tennessee is in this case.\"\n\nIn questions during oral arguments on Wednesday, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson showed how deeply she misunderstood the case at hand by deciding to conflate gender identity with race. The case, US v. Skrmetti , sees the Department of Justice and the ACLU taking the state of Tennessee to court over a law that bans medical sex changes for minors. Jackson argued that child sex changes are akin to interracial marriage in law.\n\nIn her attempt to unearth the basis of the case, Jackson brought up the 1967 Loving v. Virginia, in which an interracial couple sued to have their marriage recognized by the state. Jackson said that the case about banning medical sex changes for minors and the case about the legality of interracial marriages were \"sort of the same thing\" in that both were about innate characteristics.\n\n\"So it's interesting to me that we now have this different argument and I wonder whether Virginia could have gotten away with what they did here by just making a classification argument the way Tennessee is in this case,\" Jackson said\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who has been leaning into the idea that the Tennessee law is discriminatory on the basis of sex, agreed with Jackson's assessment, saying \"Yes, I think that's exactly right, that there is absolutely a parallel between any law that says you can't act inconsistent with a protected characteristic.\"\n\nBoth Prelogar and Jackson have made the leap that to be trans is the same thing as being of a certain race, something immutable and unchangeable, and in the case of trans, a condition that requires a person to undergo medical treatment to enable them to appear as the opposite sex.\n\nIt wasn't until Justice Samuel Alito brought up the question of trans as an immutable characteristic, however, that it was addressed outright. Alito asked ACLU attorney Chase Strangio, who is a female who presents as a man and identifies as trans, \"Is transgender status immutable?\"\n\nThe question speaks to the heart of what many destransitioners have said, those who have undergone medical sex changes, whether with drugs, surgeries, or both, and realized with profound regret that changing sex is not actually possible. Those detransitioners, many of who were protesting and speaking outside the court on Wednesday, had turned to mental and medical professionals when they were experiencing extreme distress and were sold the false bill of goods that is gender-affirming care. Strangio had already admitted during questioning that there is a risk of regret, though Strangio said it was far less than reports indicate, parsing the time frame of when sex change drugs are administered.\n\nStrangio did not go so far as to say that it is an immutable characteristic, instead bringing up the concept of discrimination against that given identity. \"I would say that under this Court's consideration of that criteria,\" Strangio said, \"if it is a distinguishing characteristic. Transgender people are characterized by having a gender identity that differs from their birth sex. That is distinguishing and discrete. And that also within the characterization, I would also point, if I could, to the history of discrimination, and there are many examples of in law, discrimination, exclusions from the military, criminal bans on cross-dressing and others.\"\n\nWhether or not the condition is immutable, unable to be changed, or innate, is essential to Jackson's comparison. In Loving, the question was one of interracial marriage and denying people basic rights in order to keep races separate. In Skrmetti, the question as framed by the plaintiffs is that it is discriminatory based on sex to provide specific pharmaceuticals for some medical conditions but not to ease the mental distress of gender dysphoria.\n\nJackson brought up the Loving case again with Strangio, saying that just as in Skrmetti, the Virginia attorneys in Loving who opposed interracial marriage used scientific arguments in their attempt to uphold the prohibition. In Skrmetti, science is also part of the argument, but in this case, the argument from the defendants in Tennessee is that children cannot consent to the very serious consequences and side effects of sex changes, namely infertility, the loss of sexual function, body mutilation, and the development of irreversible secondary sex characteristics of the opposite sex.\n\nThe arguments in favor of child sex changes is that a child will grow up without appearing as their natal sex, which will make it easier for them to pass in adulthood. But of course, with regret as a possibility, those changes could be found to be horribly unwelcome, as they have been for so many detransitioners. \"I'm worried that we're undermining the foundations of some of our bedrock equal protection cases,\" Jackson said.\n\nStrangio upheld Jackson's assertion that race and trans are similar conditions under the law. \"I think one of the things that's happening in this case,\" Strangio said, \"is we're seeing a lot of concerns that come in at step two of the analysis being imported into that threshold question of whether a classification has been drawn in the first instance, concerns about real differences between males and females.\n\n\"That is exactly what heightened scrutiny is intended to test. In the application of heightened scrutiny, if Tennessee can have an end run around heightened scrutiny by asserting at the outset that biology justifies the sex-based differential in the law that would undermine decades of this Court's precedent,\" Strangio said.\n\nIn other words, the two seem to believe that there is no difference between discriminating against interracial couples who choose to get married and saying that children should not be subjected to mutilation prior to maturing as adults. For Strangio, allowing girls to take estrogen for medical reasons but not allowing boys to take estrogen for mental health reasons is sex-based discrimination, and allowing boys to take testosterone for medical reasons but denying testosterone for girls who want to be boys is akin to preventing loving couples from marrying.\n\n2024-12-05T02:58-0500 | Comment by: Dean\n\nGot to remember that they weren't bred for their smarts.

He delivered his remarks to an audience filled with pop stars and drag queens .\n\nIn his remarks, he spoke of the need to protect \"trans kids\" from \"the hundreds of callous and cynical laws introduced in the states, targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors who give children the care they need.

Brita Filter, who performed for students at the Grace Church School in New York, was on hand to witness the signing. The laws President Biden is referring to are those that seek to ban doctors from attempting to perform experimental sex changes on children .

Furthermore, the laws would make it illegal for surgeons to amputate the breasts of gender-confused teenage girls . These are the laws the President feels children need protecting from.

Wade, Owens said. Jackson also said a ban on interracial marriage is next. Thomas is married to Ginni Thomas, a white woman. The remarks were condemned by a group of black conservatives.\n\n. @BGThompsonMS called Justice Thomas \"Uncle Tom\" & said \"he doesn't like being black.\" Joy Reid called @WinsomeSears \"a black mouth of white supremacy.\" A white cartoonist portrayed @BurgessOwens as a white klansman. @BurgessOwens reads some of the racist comments from the left pic.twitter.com/9Xw7CsBgci\n\nCongressman Bennie Thompson also piled on, calling Justice Clarence \"Uncle Tom,\" citing his support for voter ID and opposition to affirmative action.\n\n\"(Thompson) stated that Justice Thomas doesn't like black people,\" Owens said. \"He doesn't like being black.\" Owens, who appeared to be in disbelief over the claims, repeated Thompson's comments for emphasis.\n\n\"I'm gonna take a second and repeat that one,\" Owens said. \"'Justice Thomas doesn't like black people. He doesn't like being black.'\"\n\nThompson, a Democrat representative and chair of the January 6 Committee, has defended his comments to CNN, saying he can make such remarks because he's also black.\n\nMeanwhile, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Hillary Clinton attacked Justice Thomas, calling him \"angry\" and saying his decisions would overturn gay marriage, Owens said.\n\nThe justice wasn't the only minority conservative who was attacked. Owens noted that CNN suggested that Congresswoman Mayra Flores isn't the real deal and holds views outside Latino mainstream, he said.\n\nAnd Owens was portrayed as a white Klansmen by a white newspaper cartoonist for the Utah State Salt Lake City Tribune.\n\n\"So typical of the condescending racism,\" Owens said.\n\n\"If these same attacks were aimed at Barack Obama, it would be called out by this committee and the media for exactly what it is - pure racism,\" he said.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

      "text": "Berkeley professor says 'to abolish whiteness is to abolish white people'\n\nZeus Leonardo said, \"to abolish whiteness is to abolish white people... That's different from white bodies, right, white bodies will still exist, but we will no longer consider them white people.\"\n\nZeus Leonardo, who teaches within Berkeley's Graduate School of Education , has written and spoken at length about the problems with white people. In a talk, he said, \"to abolish whiteness is to abolish white people.\" He told his class in 2007 that this is \"very uncomfortable, perhaps, but it asks about our definitions of what race is and what racial justice might mean.\" He is in the department of Critical Studies of Race, Class, and Gender.\n\nLeonardo writes books and articles on pedagogy, or teaching methods, among other areas of critical race studies. His book Race, Whiteness, and Education is about \"reaffirming a critical appreciation of the central role that race and racism still play in schools and society.\" In other words, the way things are taught is racist. The book offers a \"conceptual engagement of race and whiteness asks questions about its origins, its maintenance, and envisages its future.\" It asks \"fundamental questions about whiteness in schools and society.\"\n\nUC Berkeley professor Zeus Leonardo: \"To abolish whiteness is to abolish white people.\" pic.twitter.com/F7S1cOwAAs\n\nIt's during Leonardo's talk on \"Teaching Whiteness in a Multicultural Context and Color-blind Era\" that he says \"But to, to my understanding, if you sort of undercut the category of whiteness, which the identity of white people depends on, you are, in effect, undercutting the concept of white people.\"\n\n\"And so my recent understanding is that to abolish whiteness is to abolish white people. Okay, now, that's, that's different from white bodies, right, white bodies will still exist, but we will no longer consider them white people,\" Leonardo continues in largely nonsensical academic-speak .\n\n\"I'll get into this a little more,\" Leonardo promises. \"But I'm trying to distinguish between whiteness and ideology, white people and identities and white bodies, which is some kind of literal understanding there that then we graft the meaning of white people onto. Right. But if you undercut whiteness as an ideology, one that a lot of abolitionists suggest is parasitic, right? And it's an ideology that white people really depend on.\"\n\nWhile that doesn't actually appear to make any sense, like much of his other work on this topic, he appears to be attempting to dismember the concept of whiteness from white people and from the identities white people have. That's a confusing idea, because he also uses whiteness to identify white people.\n\nLeonardo goes on to suggest that the way to abolish white people is to make them not be white anymore, because white children are taught to be white and they can, in essence, be taught to not be white.\n\n\"If we give white people an option out of that, and it's not just sort of words, right? It's sort of structural transformations, then what I'm suggesting is that it also signals the withering away of white people.\n\n\"If you can imagine we didn't have white people anyway about, let's say, 600 years ago. So the suggestion by abolitionists is we made white people, so one is not born white. By virtue of having a white Bible, one has to be taught to be white.\n\n\"And there are many signals both in our home and in our schools, of how whites are taught as young children to be white. And usually, that means in opposition to the non-white, usually black,\" Leonardo says, referencing others in this field of \"whiteness studies\" with whom he agrees.\n\n\"Now, it might seem strange to you that white folks may find this quite controversial to suggest not being white anymore. It's ironic and controversial, because in a colorblind era, white folks already don't buy into their whiteness. So why would it be so unsettling to suggest to white folks that you not be white anymore when most white folks go through daily life, assuming they're not white anyway? Right?\" He asks.\n\n\"Well, I suppose one answer to that is that white people know that they're white. Right?\" He goes on. \"When we talk as if, and this includes people of color too sometimes, but we talk as if they don't know their way, we talk about ways as being ignorant of race. Okay, not knowledgeable, not having grown up with the discourse in their home.\n\n\"Now, this has certain problems about the innocence of whiteness, right? Because we also know just from personal experience, that if a white person took a non-white person home as a date, everything changes. Right?\" Leonardo posits this idea from the mid-20th century, one that has long been done away with in America where interracial marriage and families where children and parents frequently do not share the same skin tone are incredibly common, not just in progressive circles, but across the country.\n\n\"To bring home a friend who's not white, everything changes,\" he says as though this is fact and not some pre-Civil Rights Era status quo that has long been eradicated in American civil society.\n\n\"So in some, at least lived way, whites already know that they're white and that may explain why there's sort of this defensive reaction towards abolishing whiteness and abolishing white people, because there is an investment here, okay,\" Leonardo says, as though that could be the only reason that someone who is designated to be part of a given race of people would have feelings about being told that race should be abolished.\n\n\"So colorblindness isn't necessarily such a literal process of being blind to color. It's about feigning being blind to color, because in a completely racialized globe, how do you not see race?\"\n\nLeonardo's papers, the abstracts for which read like a satire of critical race theory and anti-whiteness as opposed to the thing itself, approach the idea of whiteness as something that must be overcome. Leonardo's research is, in part, in the area of curriculum studies.\n\nOne of his papers, from 2004, entitled, \"Critical Social Theory and Transformative Knowledge: The Functions of Criticism in Quality Education,\" has the following description :\n\n\"Critical social theory is a multidisciplinary knowledge base with the implicit goal of advancing the emancipatory function of knowledge. It approaches this goal by promoting the role of criticism in the search for quality education. Through critical social theory in education, quality is proportional to the depth of analysis that students have at their disposal. As a critical form of classroom discourse, critical social theory cultivates students' ability to critique institutional as well as conceptual dilemmas, particularly those that lead to domination or oppression. It also promotes a language of transcendence that complements a language of critique in order to forge alternative and less oppressive social arrangements. A critical social theory-based movement in education highlights the relationship between social systems and people, how they produce each other, and ultimately how critical social theory can contribute to the emancipation of both.\"\n\nHis book , on the founder of \"post-colonial studies\" Edward Said, \"introduces the field of curriculum studies, an area of scholarship that has a long history in the educational literature.\" It claims that \"teachers should cultivate being anti-intellectuals,\" and argues for the inclusion of \"educational criticism\" as \"a bona fide area with its own discursive community, institutional supports, and traditions.\"\n\nWhite people in today's media landscape are told constantly that they are white, and that they must identify as white. They are told that the identity of whiteness is a negative identity, because it brings with it a full ancestry of oppression for which white people, as the descendants of those hate-filled ancestors, are responsible.\n\nThey are told that their whiteness has been used to create intricate systems of oppression that are so locked in formation that black people cannot get out of them and are permanently suppressed. And they are told, by professors of education like Leonardo, that they should not be white anymore, and should give up the identity of whiteness, while also not being colorblind and seeing race everywhere.\n\nNone of this makes any rational or logical sense, but rationality and logic are simply functions of whiteness anyway, according to the Smithsonian. Yet, it's professors like Leonardo in the Graduate School of Education at one of the nation's most prestigious universities that are teaching the next round of educators and education scholars how to perceive of race and how to conceive of curriculum for a student body that will lead America in the coming decades.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
