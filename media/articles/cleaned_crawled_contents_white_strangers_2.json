Morton, Pool)\n\nA jury found three Georgia men guilty of murder in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man whom the trio pursued and confronted after seeing Arbery running in their neighborhood in 2020. (AP Graphic)\n\nBRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) - Three men were convicted of murder Wednesday in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery , the Black man who was running empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision when the white strangers chased him, trapped him on a quiet street and blasted him with a shotgun.\n\nThe February 2020 slaying drew limited attention at first. But when video of the shooting leaked online, Arbery's death quickly became another example in the nation's reckoning of racial injustice in the way Black people are treated in their everyday lives.\n\nNow the men all face a mandatory sentence of life in prison . The judge will decide whether their sentences are served with or without the possibility of parole.\n\nAs the first of 23 guilty verdicts were read, Arbery's father had to leave the courtroom after leaping up and shouting. At the reading of the last criminal count, Arbery's mother dropped her head and quietly pumped her fists.\n\n\"He didn't do nothing but run and dream,\" Marcus Arbery Sr. said of his son. Outside the courthouse, dozens of Black supporters hugged and cried.\n\nThe jury deliberated for about 10 hours before convicting Greg McMichael, son Travis McMichael and neighbor William \"Roddie\" Bryan.\n\nThe McMichaels grabbed guns and jumped in a pickup truck to pursue the 25-year-old Arbery after seeing him running outside the Georgia port city of Brunswick. Bryan joined the pursuit in his own pickup and recorded cellphone video of Travis McMichael fatally shooting Arbery.\n\nThe father and son told police they suspected Arbery was a fleeing burglar. But the prosecution argued that the men provoked the fatal confrontation and that there was no evidence Arbery committed any crimes in the neighborhood.\n\n\"We commend the courage and bravery of this jury to say that what happened on Feb. 23, 2020, to Ahmaud Arbery - the hunting and killing of Ahmaud Arbery - it was not only morally wrong but legally wrong, and we are thankful for that,\" said Latonia Hines, Cobb County executive assistant district attorney.\n\nProsecutor Linda Dunikoski added: \"The jury system works in this country. And when you present the truth to people and they see it, they will do the right thing.\"\n\nTravis McMichael, 35, stood for the verdict, his lawyer's arm around his shoulder. At one point, he lowered his head to his chest. After the verdicts were read, as he stood to leave, he mouthed \"love you\" to his mother in the courtroom gallery.\n\nGreg McMichael, 65, hung his head when the judge read his first guilty verdict. Bryan, 52, bit his lip.\n\nSpeaking outside the courthouse, Ben Crump, attorney for Arbery's father, repeatedly said that \"the spirit of Ahmaud defeated the lynch mob.\"\n\nArbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, thanked the crowd gathered for the verdict and said she did not think she would see this day.\n\n\"It's been a long fight. It's been a hard fight. But God is good,\" she said, adding that her son would now rest in peace.\n\nTravis McMichaels' attorneys said both he and his father feel that they did the right thing, and that they believed the video would help their case. But they also said the McMichaels regret that Arbery got killed.\n\n\"I can tell you honestly, these men are sorry for what happened to Ahmaud Arbery,\" attorney Jason Sheffield said. \"They are sorry he's dead. They are sorry for the tragedy that happened because of the choices they made to go out there and try to stop him.\"\n\nThey planned to appeal.\n\nBryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, said his team was \"disappointed with the verdict, but we respect it.\" He planned to file new legal motions after Thanksgiving.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley did not immediately schedule a sentencing date, saying that he wanted to give both sides time to prepare.\n\nIn a statement, President Joe Biden said Arbery's killing was a \"devastating reminder\" of how much more work the country has to do in the fight for racial justice.\n\n\"While the guilty verdicts reflect our justice system doing its job, that alone is not enough. Instead, we must recommit ourselves to building a future of unity and shared strength, where no one fears violence because of the color of their skin,\" Biden said.\n\nThough prosecutors did not argue that racism motivated the killing, federal authorities have charged them with hate crimes, alleging that they chased and killed Arbery because he was Black. That case is scheduled to go to trial in February.\n\nThe disproportionately white jury received the case around midday Tuesday.\n\nSoon after returning to court Wednesday morning, the jury sent a note to the judge asking to view two versions of the shooting video - the original and one that investigators enhanced to reduce shadows - three times apiece.\n\nJurors returned to the courtroom to see the videos and listen again the 911 call one of the defendants made from the bed of a pickup truck about 30 seconds before the shooting.\n\nOn the 911 call the jury reviewed, Greg McMichael tells an operator: \"I'm out here in Satilla Shores. There's a Black male running down the street.\"\n\nHe then starts shouting, apparently as Arbery is running toward the McMichael's idling truck with Bryan's truck coming up behind him: \"Stop right there! Damn it, stop! Travis!\" Gunshots can be heard a few second later.\n\nThe graphic video emerged two months later, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case, quickly arresting the three men.\n\nDefense attorneys contend the McMichaels were attempting a legal citizen's arrest when they set off after Arbery, seeking to detain and question him after he was seen running from a nearby home under construction.\n\nTravis McMichael testified that he shot Arbery in self-defense. He said Arbery turned and attacked with his fists while running past the truck where McMichael stood with his shotgun.\n\nAt the time of his death, Arbery had enrolled at a technical college and was preparing to study to become an electrician like his uncles.\n\nShaun Seals, a 32-year-old lifelong Brunswick resident, rushed to the courthouse to join the crowd cheering the verdict.\n\n\"We just came out to witness history,\" said Seals, pushing his 10-month-old daughter in a stroller.\n\nSeals, who is Black, called the convictions a victory not just for his community but for the nation.\n\n\"It's not going to heal most of the wounds\" from a long history of inequality, he said. \"But it's a start and shows people are trying.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nRIDGELAND, Miss. (AP) - Attorneys for a Black delivery driver are calling for a federal hate crimes probe of the attempted shooting of the driver in Mississippi, saying it's another example of Black Americans facing danger simply for going about their daily activities.\n\nThe FedEx driver, 24-year-old D'Monterrio Gibson, was not wounded in the Jan. 24 incident. One of his attorneys, Carlos Moore, said Thursday that he believes police are not taking the investigation seriously. Two white men are facing charges, but Moore said the state needs to upgrade those charges to attempted murder.\n\nMoore said Gibson had done nothing wrong before two white men tried to stop him, with one of the men holding a gun.\n\n\"He was simply Black while working,\" Moore said during a news conference.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press on Thursday that the department received a request to look into the case and will review the request to determine any next steps.\n\nGibson said he was wearing a FedEx uniform and was driving an umarked van that FedEx had rented when he dropped off a package at a house in south Mississippi. He said as he was leaving, he noticed a white pickup truck pulling away from another house on the same large lot.\n\nHe said the pickup driver tried to cut him off as he left the driveway. Gibson swerved around him and then encountered a second man who had a gun pointed at the van and was motioning for him to stop. Gibson said the man fired as he drove away, damaging the van and packages inside. He said the white pickup chased him to the interstate highway near Brookhaven before ending the pursuit.\n\nTwo white men from Brookhaven, 58-year-old Gregory Charles Case and his son 35-year-old Brandon Case, were arrested and released on Feb. 1. Police told local news outlets that the elder Case was the suspected pickup driver, while Brandon Case was the man in the street. Gregory Charles Case is charged with conspiracy. Brandon Case is charged with aggravated assault.\n\nThe attorneys who represent the men - Terrell Stubbs for the father and Dan Kitchens for the son - did not immediately respond to two phone messages that the AP left for each of them Thursday. A person in Stubbs' office said he was in court, and a person in Kitchens' office said he was out of the office.\n\nGibson said Thursday that he is seeking mental health treatment and is on unpaid leave from his job.\n\n\"I have real bad anxiety since the incident,\" Gibson said.\n\nJim Masilak, manager of media relations for FedEx, said in response to questions from AP Thursday: \"FedEx takes situations of this nature very seriously, and we are shocked by this criminal act against our team member. ... The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we remain focused on his wellbeing. We will continue to support Mr. Gibson as we cooperate with investigating authorities.\"\n\nNobody was injured but the chase and gunfire have sparked social media complaints of racism in Brookhaven, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) south of the state capital, Jackson. The local NAACP chairman has called on city's Black police chief to resign, but the chief says he has no intention to do so.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere until God makes that decision,\" Collins told the Daily Leader . \"That's between me and God. Until God calls me I'm not worried about what anybody says.\"\n\nMoore compares the incident to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was running empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision in 2020 when three white strangers chased him down and blasted him with a shotgun. The white men, including a father and son, were convicted of murder and sentenced to life . Defense lawyers said they suspected Arbery had committed crimes in their neighborhood, but prosecutors said there was no evidence of that. The three still face a federal hate crime trial .\n\nAbout 68% of Brookhaven's 12,000 residents are Black. The city is in Lincoln County, where District Attorney Dee Bates said information will be presented to a grand jury for a decision on charges once police complete their investigation of the Gibson incident. Witnesses, including Gibson, will be able to testify.\n\nJames A. Bryant II of Los Angeles, another of the attorneys representing Gibson, said Thursday that Gibson experiences pain knowing that people tried to harm him because he is Black.\n\n\"That has to be the most frightening experience one could face as a young Black man,\" Bryant said. \"And then not only that - they continued to chase him until they got to the freeway. So what would have happened if they were able to cut him off?\"\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Kevin McGill in New Orleans contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThis story was first published Feb. 10, 2022.

A Black FedEx driver, D'Monterrio Gibson was allegedly shot at by the Cases. (Hunter Cloud/The Daily Leader via AP)\n\nBROOKHAVEN, Miss. (AP) - Attorneys made brief opening arguments Tuesday in the trial of two white men in Mississippi who are accused of chasing and shooting at a Black FedEx driver who had dropped off a package at a home.\n\nBrandon Case and his father, Gregory Charles Case, were indicted in November on charges of attempted first-degree murder, conspiracy and shooting into the vehicle of D'Monterrio Gibson in January 2022.\n\nGibson, who was 24 at the time, was not injured. But the chase and gunfire led to complaints on social media of racism in Brookhaven, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) south of the state capital, Jackson. The trial is taking place in Brookhaven.\n\nDistrict Attorney Dee Bates told jurors that Gibson made deliveries for FedEx on Jan. 24, 2022, while driving a rental van with the Hertz logo on three sides. Gibson dropped off a package at a home on a dead-end road, Bates said. Then, Gregory Case used a pickup truck to try to block the van from leaving, and Brandon Case came outside with a gun, the prosecutor said.\n\nAs Gibson drove the van around the pickup truck \"and shots are fired,\" Bates said, with three rounds hitting the delivery van.\n\nGregory Case's attorney, Terrell Stubbs, told jurors that his client saw a van outside his mother-in-law's unoccupied home and went to check what was happening. Gregory Case was just going to ask the van driver what was going on, but the driver did not stop, Stubbs said.\n\nThe sun had already gone down. \"It was completely dark, completely dark, and somebody was in the wrong place,\" Stubbs said. \"It wasn't my client.\"\n\nAttorneys for Brandon Case did not give opening arguments. Testimony is set to begin Wednesday.\n\nDuring a news conference days after the confrontation, Gibson said he was wearing a FedEx uniform and driving an unmarked van FedEx had rented when he dropped off a package at a house. He said that as he was leaving, he noticed a white pickup truck pulling away from another house on the same large lot.\n\nGibson said the pickup driver tried to cut him off as he left the driveway. He said he swerved around the driver and then encountered a second man who had a gun pointed at the van and was motioning for him to stop. Gibson said the man fired as he drove away, damaging the van and packages inside. The white pickup chased him to Interstate 55 near Brookhaven before ending the pursuit, he said.\n\nCarlos Moore, an attorney who represented Gibson in a lawsuit in federal court, compared the episode to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery , a 25-year-old Black man who was running empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision in 2020 when three white strangers chased him down and blasted him with a shotgun.\n\nMoore said Tuesday that Gibson's family \"is cautiously optimistic that they'll get justice here in Lincoln County.\"\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III dismissed the $5 million lawsuit Moore filed on behalf of Gibson in January 2023. The lawsuit was against FedEx, the city of Brookhaven, Brookhaven Police Chief Kenny Collins, Brandon Case and Gregory Charles Case.\n\nJordan wrote that Gibson's attorney failed to prove FedEx discriminated against Gibson because of his race.\n\n\"The Cases' alleged conduct is deplorable,\" Jordan wrote. \"But Gibson fails to state a viable claim against FedEx for which the Court would have original jurisdiction.\"\n\nMoore said Friday that he plans to sue in state court. He also said Gibson is still employed by FedEx and is out on workers' compensation leave.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP) - Prosecutors and defense attorneys on Friday presented dueling portraits of Ahmaud Arbery, who was either an innocent Black runner fatally shot by three white strangers or \"a scary mystery\" who had been seen prowling around a Georgia neighborhood.\n\nIn her opening statement, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said the short cellphone video that stirred national outrage over Arbery's slaying offered only a glimpse of the attack on the 25-year-old, who gave his pursuers no reason to suspect him of any wrongdoing.\n\n\"They assumed that he must have committed some crime that day,\" Dunikoski said. \"He tried to run around their truck and get way from these strangers, total strangers, who had already told him that they would kill him. And then they killed him.\"\n\nAn attorney for Travis McMichael, the man who shot Arbery three times, put the shooting in a much different light. Attorney Robert Rubin described Arbery to the overwhelmingly white jury as \"an intruder\" who had four times been recorded on video \"plundering around\" a neighboring house under construction.\n\nMcMichael and his father, Greg McMichael, gave chase, hoping to detain Arbery until police arrived, Rubin said, but Arbery refused to stop and lunged toward McMichael and his gun.\n\n\"It is a horrible, horrible video, and it's tragic that Ahmaud Arbery lost his life,\" Rubin said. \"But at that point, Travis McMichael is acting in self-defense. He did not want to encounter Ahmaud Arbery physically. He was only trying to stop him for the police.\"\n\nArbery's killing on Feb . 23, 2020, was largely ignored until the video leaked and deepened a national reckoning over racial injustice.\n\nOn that Sunday afternoon, the McMichaels armed themselves and pursued Arbery in a pickup truck as he ran through their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick. A neighbor, William \"Roddie\" Bryan, joined the chase and recorded graphic video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery with a shotgun.\n\nThe chase started when a neighbor who's not charged in the case called a nonemergency police number after seeing Arbery wandering inside a home under construction, where security cameras had recorded him before.\n\nDunikoski said Greg McMichael later told police that at one point during the chase he shouted at Arbery, \"Stop or I'll blow your f--ing head off!\"\n\nWhen a police officer who responded to the shooting asked Greg McMichael if Arbery had broken into a house, he told the officer: \"That's just it. I don't know ... I don't know. He might have gone in somebody's house,\" according to Dunikoski.\n\n\"All three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions - not on facts, not on evidence,\" Dunikoski said. \"And they made decisions in their driveways based on those assumptions that took a young man's life.\"\n\nAs Dunikoski played the video of Arbery's death for the jury, his mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, cried out in the courtroom and sobbed as her attorney tried to console her.\n\nRubin described Arbery as a \"scary mystery\" to residents of a neighborhood already on edge from thefts and property crimes. Travis McMichael saw him outside the home construction site at night 11 days before the shooting. When Arbery reached for his pocket, Rubin said, Travis Michael feared he was reaching for gun.\n\nThat's why the McMichaels grabbed guns before chasing Arbery, Rubin said, insisting they had probable cause to legally detain him on suspicion of stealing under a Georgia law allowing citizen's arrests. The law was later repealed in response to Arbery's death.\n\nAs Arbery ran toward the McMichaels' truck, Travis McMichael raised the shotgun in hopes that \"he's going to deescalate the situation,\" Rubin said. Instead of running past him, Rubin said, Arbery turned toward Travis McMichael \"swinging aggressively\" with his fists.\n\nTravis McMichael, Rubin said, recalled his firearms training from when he served in the Coast Guard: \"Never lose your weapon. And that's why he shoots.\"\n\n\"He has no choice because if this guy gets his gun, he's dead or his dad's dead,\" Rubin said.\n\nGreg McMichael was in his driveway reupholstering boat cushions when he saw Arbery run past \"hauling ass,\" said Franklin Hogue, Greg McMichael's defense attorney.\n\n\"Greg McMichael was absolutely sure this was the guy, the same guy he had seen on surveillance video inside a house where Greg had sound reasons to believe theft had occurred, burglary,\" Hogue said.\n\nHogue said most facts in the trial are not in dispute.\n\n\"The why it happened is what this case is about,\" Hogue said. \"This case is about intent, beliefs, knowledge - reasons for beliefs whether they were true or not.\"\n\nBryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, deferred making an opening statement until after prosecutors rest their case, which Georgia courts allow.\n\nAll three defendants are standing trial together, charged with murder and other felonies.\n\nArbery had been dead for more than two months when Bryan's video of the killing leaked online in May 2020. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police. GBI agents arrested the McMichaels the next day, and charged Bryan two weeks later.\n\nDunikoski described Arbery as an \"avid runner\" and told the jury it was not surprising for him to go running in the Satilla Shores subdivision, which was less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from his own home.\n\nWhen he was killed, Arbery had no weapon and was carrying no wallet or keys, Dunikoski said.\n\nArbery \"couldn't even have called for help if he wanted to because he had no cellphone on him,\" she added.\n\nOfficer William Duggan of Glynn County police was the first witness to testify. Duggan was the second officer to arrive after the shooting. Video from his body camera showed Arbery, his white T-shirt soaked with blood, facedown in the road. Duggan rolled him over and pressed a hand to his wounded chest.\n\nHe told other first responders he heard Arbery gurgling at first, but said he died after about two minutes.\n\n\"I had pressure on, but there was nothing I could do,\" Duggan said on the video.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - Two white men were arrested earlier this week, days after a Black delivery van driver accused them of chasing him and shooting at him after he dropped off a package in a Mississippi city.\n\nBut driver D'Monterrio Gibson, 24, on Friday said he doesn't believe police took him seriously at first and his attorneys say both suspects have been \"undercharged\" and should face charges of attempted murder.\n\nNobody was injured but the chase and gunfire have sparked social media complaints of racism in Brookhaven, Mississippi, about 55 miles (89 kilometers) south of Jackson - and pushback in local media from the city's Black police chief.\n\nGregory Case and his son Brandon Case were arrested and released on bond Tuesday in connection with the alleged Jan. 24 attack on Gibson, 24. Gregory Case faces a charge of conspiracy; Brandon Case, shooting into a motor vehicle.\n\nLawyers for Gibson say more serious charges, including hate crime charges, are warranted in what they believe was a racially motivated assault. \"I want both of them charged with attempted murder,\" attorney Carlos Moore said Friday.\n\nMoore and attorney James Bryant compared the incident to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was running empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision in 2020 when three white strangers chased him down and blasted him with a shotgun. The white men, including a father and son, were convicted of murder and sentenced to life . Defense lawyers said they suspected he had committed crimes in their neighborhood, but prosecutors said there was no evidence of that. The three still face a federal hate crime trial .\n\nBrookhaven, with a population that is 68% Black, is in Lincoln County, where District Attorney Dee Bates said information will be presented to a grand jury for a decision on charges once police complete the investigation of the Gibson incident. Witnesses, including Gibson, will be able to testify.\n\nGibson told The Associated Press on Friday that he was in uniform when the incident happened. He said he was in a van rented by FedEx but that it did not have a FedEx logo on it. He pulled into a driveway and dropped off a package sometime after 7 p.m. on Jan. 24. Before he turned his van around in the driveway to exit, he said, he noticed a white pickup truck pulling away from another house on the same large lot.\n\nHe said the pickup driver tried to cut him off as he exited the driveway. Gibson swerved around him and then encountered a second man.\n\n\"I drive down about two or three houses and there's another guy standing in the middle of the street, with a gun pointed at my vehicle,\" said Gibson. The man motioned for him to stop. \"I'm looking at him, like shaking my head, because why would I stop for somebody with a gun?\"\n\nGibson said the man fired as he drove away, damaging the van and packages inside. He said the white pickup chased him to the interstate highway near Brookhaven before ending the chase. Later, police told local news outlets that the elder Case was the suspected pickup driver, while Brandon Case was the man in the street. Gregory Case is 58, and his son is 35, according to The Daily Leader of Brookhaven.\n\nGibson said he called police and was told by one officer that police had received a call about a suspicious person at the same address at the same time. \"I said, 'Sir, I'm not a suspicious person. I'm a FedEx worker. I was just doing my job and they shot at me.'\"\n\nThe Cases have not commented publicly on their arrests. The municipal clerk's office in Brookhaven said Friday morning it had not yet received paperwork on their arrests or information on their attorneys. Police chief Kenny Collins did not return calls from the AP seeking more information.\n\nEarly this week, Collins, who is Black, pushed back against allegations on social media of racism in Brookhaven. \"We're not going to have outsiders coming in trying to stir that up,\" he told The Daily Leader . \"Brookhaven is not a racist, prejudiced town. You can't judge a town by the actions of two individuals.\"\n\n\"People need to be careful what they post on social media,\" Collins said. \"If somebody is killed or hurt because of what you post on social media, you will be charged, too.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story was first published Feb. 4, 2022.

(AP Photo/Jed Jacobsohn)\n\nRobert Griffin III is still training to play in the NFL while enjoying his duties as an ESPN college football analyst.\n\nRG3 may have even found a way to be in two places at once.\n\nThe 2012 AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year is an investor in holographic telepresence startup PORTL Inc. The company's first product, the Epic PORTL Hologram Machine, allows people to beam in from remote locations for human-sized, life-like interactive communication.\n\n\"Maybe I can call the game from the hotel room with the team,\" Griffin joked. \"But, seriously, PORTL is the wave of the future. ... This is an opportunity not only to affect the market of advertising, marketing, to beaming people different places for concerts or for meetings. It's not just really cool, but it's practical. ... People have told me since I turned pro there's nothing more valuable than your time. So instead of having to fly all the way across the world to go to China or go to Switzerland, or to go to Europe, wherever, you can just beam yourself over there. Instead of having to spend all this money to do these different advertising things, you can literally invest in this PORTL device and do all your advertising in one spot and make it come to life.\"\n\nGriffin spent the previous three seasons in Baltimore. He got two starts backing up Lamar Jackson in 2019-20. Though he's doing well in his current role, the 31-year-old still wants to play in the NFL.\n\n\"Yes, there is still an itch to play,\" Griffin said on the AP Pro Football Podcast. \"I don't shy away from that. I schedule my week as if I'm with the team.\"\n\nGriffin says he works out Mondays, watches films Tuesdays and throws on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Friday.\n\n\"My job right now at ESPN is to be the best analyst I could possibly be calling college football games and eventually NFL games, and I'm doing NFL analyst work right now,\" he said. \"But when that call comes and a team needs me, I'll be ready to go. Am I getting calls? Yes, I'm getting calls. Have they pulled the trigger? No, they haven't. So for me, it's just about making sure you stay ready so you don't have to get ready.\"\n\nFive-time Pro Bowl running back Marshawn Lynch also has partnered with PORTL.\n\n\"When I was playing, we always missed holidays, special events for families and I always wished I could've been there,\" Lynch told the AP. \"Now, I can be two places at once. I wish I could have done this my whole career and been a part of birthday parties and graduations and all the things I missed in preparation for a game or to be at a game.\"\n\n___\n\nGRONK'S CLEATS\n\nBuccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski will be honoring the USO on his cleats for this year's NFL My Cause My Cleats campaign.\n\nInspired by the service and sacrifice of military service members and their families, Gronkowski also is starring in a video that gives an inside look at the inspiration for the cleats' design, and at the \"unboxing.\" Gronkowski, in partnership with USAA, also coordinated a surprise for a USO military family, the Jasens.\n\nThe cleats were designed by Marcus Rivero, who is better known as Soles by Sir. The cleats honor the USO and the Jasen family, along with the Gronk Nation Youth Foundation.\n\n___\n\nLIGHTEN UP\n\nThanks to the evolution of sports science, and concessions to the players' union, NFL teams don't practice nearly as intensely in the past. Even though they're typically playing at least four more games as a pro than they did in college, the rookie wall isn't what it once was due to the way coaches manage their practice sessions to keep players as fresh as possible down the stretch.\n\n\"It's so big of a difference. That's why I love this league so much, the practice style not being so intense,\" said Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson, who's in his second NFL season. \"College practices are always intense, always high energy, everybody's going 100%. It's like that in the NFL, too, but people know how to take care of their bodies, know how to practice and know what speeds to go at. We all take care of ourselves. In college it's lifting heavy weights. The NFL is more laid back.\"\n\nFor coaches who came up through the game in a different era, it's still an adjustment.\n\n\"We do have some older players that we have to take care of, but there's a fine line with some of the young guys that are playing so they don't get as good a work as they would,\" Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said, adding: \"They've been emptying their buckets for me and for them each and every week, so I'm trying to take care of them so they can do that again on Sunday.\"\n\nZimmer confers regularly with head athletic trainer Eric Sugarman and head strength and conditioning coach Josh Hingst about how to handle the workload.\n\n\"I have two little angels or devils or whatever they call them on my shoulders, you know?\" Zimmer said. \"Usually I'm the one saying the opposite most of the time.\"\n\nGENEROUS BILLS MAFIA\n\nThough sidelined by a season-ending knee injury, cornerback Tre'Davious White's spirits were lifted discovering the strength of the Bills Mafia's giving power.\n\nThe Bills' fan base rallied in the wake of White getting hurt last week by donating more than $108,000 through Wednesday to the Food Bank of Northwest Louisiana, which is based in the player's hometown of Shreveport.\n\n\"I am at a loss for words for what the Bills Mafia has done for me and my hometown,\" White said in a statement released by his agent. \"It truly means the world to me to have my fans support me in this way, by giving back to my community.\"\n\nWhite was hurt in a 31-6 win over the Saints on Thanksgiving night, in the fifth-year player's first pro game in his home state.\n\nMany of the donations came in at $27, representing White's jersey number. The push for donations was prompted by a tweet from the BillsMafiaBabes account on Tuesday, which read: \"This one hurts. It hurts a LOT. What better way to show you love for our CB1 than to honor him on this giving Tuesday by giving to @FoodBankofNWLA in his name.\"\n\nWhite is the latest player to be wowed by Bills Mafia's generosity.\n\nThe group previously flooded donations to Buffalo's Oishei Children's Hospital on behalf of Bills quarterback Josh Allen following the death of his grandmother last year. Four years ago, Bills fans donated more than $300,000 to Andy Dalton's charity after the former Bengals quarterback led Cincinnati to a last-minute, season-ending win over Baltimore, which clinched Buffalo its first playoff berth since 1999.\n\nHONORING AHMAUD ARBERY\n\nDetroit Lions safety Tracy Walker is participating in the NFL's \"My Cleats, My Cause\" campaign to honor his late cousin, Ahmaud Arbery, while hoping to raise funds and awareness for Black Lives Matter.\n\n\"I know everybody says all lives matter, but in that situation, I want to represent my cousin,\" said Walker, who will wear cleats that include Arbery's likeness on Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nThree men were convicted of murder in the killing of Arbery last week.\n\n\"It was a great day for me,\" Walker said. \"It's a sigh of relief. It's sad that we had to wait this long.\"\n\nArbery was a Black man, running empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision when white strangers chased and trapped him on a quiet street before killing him with a shotgun in February, 2020. While Walker laments nothing can bring his cousin back, he's trying to do what he can to affect change about racial justice.\n\n\"I'm just trying to promote treat everybody equally, love everybody equally,\" Walker said.\n\nHOUSTON PROUD\n\nThe Houston Texans partnered with several companies this week to award $400,000 in grants to nonprofit organizations that support social justice and racial equity efforts in Houston.\n\nMore than 100 grant applications were submitted, and a committee led by Hannah McNair, vice president of the team's foundation and wife of team owner Cal McNair, chose 15 organization to receive the funds.\n\n\"The organizations' unwavering commitment to Houston's youth and their families is unmatched, and we're proud to help them continue to make a positive impact on the next generation,\" Hannah McNair said. \"We know that it takes all of us to inspire change and we are looking forward to seeing their continued work to reduce barriers for so many in our community.\"\n\nThe money was distributed from the Inspire Change Grant Fund created in September.\n\nThe grants, which ranged from $10,000 to $50,000, will be used to support a variety of social justice initiatives, including health advocacy, criminal justice reform, homelessness, youth development, education and mental health.\n\nThe largest grant of $50,000 was awarded to the SHAPE Community Center, which works to improve the life of people of African descent. The money will be used for youth leadership programs and a week-long summer tour that will take students through the South to sites central to the civil rights movement.\n\nA $35,000 grant was given to CY-Hope, which will use the funds to provide counseling and speech therapy to children and families in need.\n\nThe Inspire Change initiative was introduced by the NFL in 2019 to help local communities and support programs that reduce barriers. The Texans awarded $100,000 in grants in each of the first two years of the initiative before partnering with several businesses this year to help more organizations.\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Barry Wilner, Dave Campbell and Rob Maaddi, and Sports Writers Kristie Rieken, John Wawrow and Larry Lage contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "'No Trouble Here': Can Mobile, Alabama Own Up to Its Lynching Legacy?\n\nAppearances are everything down South, part of the region's noted cordiality and social decorum. Yet on coastal Alabama's Mobile Bay, a group of residents is determined to peel back their languid locale's veneer of colonnaded mansions and Spanish moss-draped oaks to confront the proverbial \"ugliness that cuts to the bone.\" And to build something better from those truths.\n\nA cross-section of faces spanning age, sex and race popped onto computer screens and launched into friendly banter. Finally, a woman's voice quelled them and asked for committee reports.\n\nIt is the Mobile County Remembrance Project's monthly online meeting, 20-plus activists driven onto the technological forum that defines group efforts in the COVID-19 era. They aim to erect markers honoring local lynching victims murdered from 1877 to 1950, a venture conducted in cooperation with Montgomery's Equal Justice Initiative (EJI).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe friendly group's ringmaster is Merceria Ludgood, the lone African American on the Mobile County's three-member governing commission. Her connection to this project is personal.\n\nLudgood's husband sits on EJI's board of directors. They were present at the 2018 unveiling of EJI's museum complex nodding to four centuries of dehumanization, bondage and marginalization that marks the African American experience. It has drawn over 750,000 international visitors to date.\n\nThey also walked, back in those pre-pandemic days, the six acres of EJI's emotionally powerful National Memorial for Peace and Justice, commonly tagged the National Lynching Memorial, 170 miles to the north in Montgomery. Its award-winning design commemorates more than 4,400 victims of racial terrorism. Steel boxes, rusted to the same hue as dried blood, resemble makeshift pauper's caskets. Each bears an American county's name then the names and death dates of those lynched there. As visitors walk its halls, the floor declines and the slabs effectively rise. What visitors enter as a graveyard becomes a hanging.\n\nIn the yard around the central structure lie duplicate markers intended for display in their respective locales, to acknowledge old wrongs. The marker destined for Mobile called out to Ludgood, she said later.\n\nHer aim-to see Mobile own this ugly past-will be difficult to achieve. Three centuries old, Mobile was a more laissez-faire Creole frontier port until King Cotton's wealth and American racial perspectives reshaped it. Despite abundant antebellum trappings, Mobile long prided itself for avoiding the bombs and attack dogs and beaten and bloodied marchers that branded other Alabama towns. Mobilians considered themselves \"better than that.\"\n\n\"Because of my age, I know the real story, but I think we've spun a narrative that isn't real,\" Ludgood said. \"Those people who cling to 'We weren't Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery or Anniston,' will have to just face up. We weren't them, but we were Mobile and had our own issues.\"\n\nInitially, Ludgood collected volunteer names at EJI founder Bryan Stevenson's November 2018 Mobile appearance. The group initially convened in January 2019. What was assumed to be a quick checking of boxes grew into something deeper.\n\n\"I figured out early on they wanted to create community, to engage with each other,\" Ludgood said. \"I think we've become a community around this work.\"\n\nThat bolsters the commissioner. She was enrolled at the University of Alabama in the first decade of its desegregation. She recalled watching a fraternity parade in their Confederate regalia accompanied by others in minstrelsy blackface.\n\n\"I had an instructor who said in class that slaves were happy, so they stayed on the plantation after emancipation. He said northerners came in and interfered. He used words like 'nigrah,'\" Ludgood said, the revulsion still in her voice.\n\nIn 1891, Zachariah Graham passed through Mobile County on the way to New York. After a chance encounter with a white girl resulted in his arrest, a mob snatched Graham from law enforcement and killed him.\n\npic.twitter.com/edDlKhP2aa\n\nIn 1919, James Lewis was killed by a group of white strangers in the same area, north of Mobile city limits. His death was happenstance. He simply crossed the path of angry whites.\n\nMobile newspapers trafficked in noxious racial stereotypes and supported white supremacy. They also blamed lynching on barbaric residents beyond the city's civilized realm.\n\n\"[The urban-rural excuse] gave those in town opportunity to blame it on the less-cultured residents in the country. That was their 'out' for looking the other way,\" historian Scotty Kirkland said.\n\nGeorge Crozier's grandfather was a Mississippi Delta plantation manager. However, the New Orleans native credits his mother for \"more enlightened sensibilities.\" After earning his marine biology doctorate on the West Coast, Crozier joined the faculty at the University of Southern Mississippi in 1966.\n\n\"We attended the Black Catholic Church and I was on the front page of the Hattiesburg American marching after Dr. King was assassinated,\" Crozier said. \"We were under threat of the Ku Klux Klan, the phone calls, everything.\"\n\nCrozier became director of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab on the namesake barrier island just beyond the mouth of Mobile Bay. He retired after nearly 40 years and spends his time with public efforts around Mobile, including the lynching memorial.\n\nThe victim Crozier was assigned to research, a man named William Walker, was discovered to have been included in error. EJI concurred and agreed to Walker's removal. Crozier switched assignments.\n\n\"I'm not sure why others haven't been more active, including people I consider to be from Mobile's gentry,\" Crozier said. \"Talk about plantation mentality.\"\n\npic.twitter.com/Hj6O3l6zHU\n\nIn 1906, Will Thompson and Cornelius \"Dick\" Robertson were separately accused of assaulting white women. Bloodthirsty mobs gathered at Mobile's jailhouse so often, the sheriff moved both men to Birmingham for safekeeping until trial.\n\nAs September closed, a catastrophic hurricane ravaged Mobile, leaving the modern equivalent of $47 million in damages. Local newspapers stoked racial tensions amidst the despair.\n\nDays after the storm, the sheriff and a deputy loaded Thompson and Robertson on a southbound train in the misty Birmingham morning. Trial awaited.\n\nEight masked men boarded just north of Mobile and seized the prisoners. They told a reporter aboard they were \"leading businessmen of Mobile\" who aimed to lynch the men just outside city limits so it wouldn't \"leave a stain upon Mobile that would take years to wipe out.\"\n\npic.twitter.com/hGNdLzZKNF\n\nWhen they dragged the captives from the train, 45 other vigilantes met them with rope. Among them was a state senator and newspaper publisher who begged the mob to let the prisoners \"stand trial and be 'legally hanged.'\"\n\n\"Assaults on our women must stop or we [may] kill every Negro in Mobile County,\" a vigilante answered.\n\nAround 200 spectators followed a short march through the countryside before the terrified men were hanged just after noon. For the rest of the day, thousands of sightseers from Mobile rode the streetcar to gawk at the swaying bodies. Some snatched tree bark, rope fibers, bits of clothing or shoes for souvenirs. Some took photos for postcards. One of the grisly snapshots is currently in the History Museum of Mobile.\n\nA year later, Moses Dossett was accused of assaulting a white woman. On a thunderous night, rain mixed with his tears as he was lynched in the same spot.\n\npic.twitter.com/vWm6F68ueP\n\nMunicipal Judge Karlos Finley's prominent family is nearly synonymous with Mobile history. Their lineage traces to the city's Creole past and is filled with notable physicians, lawyers, pharmacists, educators and other leaders.\n\nHe also believes the popular and benign version of Mobile's civil rights history, symbolized by mid 20th century Black petitioner John LeFlore and white city politician Joe Langan, wasn't as successful as portrayed.\n\n\"Mr. LeFlore was an amazing letter writer and he was always requesting things,\" Finley said. \"Then Mr. Langan would go to the powers that be and say, 'Hey, can we do this for these people?' The powers would say, 'It's just not time yet. We've got to make sure whatever we allow does not encroach upon what we're doing.'\"\n\nConciliations were piecemeal and barely effective. After Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gave a rousing 1959 speech in Mobile, Finley said power brokers felt threatened.\n\n\"Black preachers told King, 'We're OK down here. We've got good white folks. We don't need you coming back down here, stirring stuff up,'\" Finley said.\n\nComplacency ruled. Finley's father and others formed the Neighborhood Organized Workers (NOW) in the late 1960s and demanded more. He believes the impact of their boycotts and pickets resulted in criminal actions levied against its leaders. NOW was shattered.\n\nKarlos is one of five Finley relatives on the Mobile County Remembrance Project.\n\nIn 1909, Richard Robertson shot and killed a white deputy sheriff and was arrested. That night, a throng pulled Robertson from his jail cell. They dragged him outside to the corner, across from Christ Episcopal Church, shot him, then hoisted him high into an oak by his neck.\n\nFor an hour, Robertson's corpse dangled between cathedral and jail, at the intersection of church and state, the crux of Southern existence.\n\npic.twitter.com/pCfUKVA6pS\n\n\"I love research, but this has really touched my heart,\" April Livingston said of the Remembrance Project. She mentioned lynching victim James Lewis, who'd been killed in 1919 when he happened to walk down the wrong street. \"Thinking about that poor man, trying to walk home then beset upon by people who had nothing to do with him, then seeing where it could have happened and feeling I could make some small difference to his memory.\"\n\nArtist and art instructor Livingston has restored revered floats for the African American Mardi Gras organization. She sculpted a commissioned bust of Cudjo Lewis, the last local survivor of the Clotilda , the final slave ship to slip into the U.S. just before the Civil War. Voyage survivors formed the Africatown community north of downtown Mobile.\n\nShe hopes the Remembrance Project ripples through the rest of Mobile.\n\n\"It makes my stomach hurt for every time I've been told there was no trouble here,\" Livingston said. \"We must know and embrace this history as our own.\"\n\nAs chair of the University of South Alabama's History department, David Messenger recognizes time's hallmarks.\n\n\"I think this moment, George Floyd and everything else going on, I think there's great opportunity to build on and maybe integrate this into what we're doing with students,\" Messenger said.\n\nA native Canadian in Mobile just three years, his project participation has been invaluable.\n\n\"I had this naïve idea about segregation as 'we don't come into contact with each other,' but the dynamic is far different than that,\" Messenger said.\n\nThe project will not only erect plaques detailing the lynching deaths but will also host an essay contest in area high schools.\n\n\"I hope this doesn't become a passing sort of thing,\" Messenger said. \"I hope we can integrate it into more civil rights history in high schools.\"\n\nIn 1981-yes, 1981-19-year-old Michael Donald was found lynched on a midtown residential block. A family of Klansmen randomly seized and killed the young man, then displayed his body in their neighborhood. Mobilians were shocked, embarrassed.\n\nThose responsible were tried. One pled guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. One was convicted as an accomplice. One was executed by electric chair in 1997. The family patriarch was indicted but died before his trial could be completed.\n\nOwing to its late date, Donald's murder isn't included on EJI's lynching memorial, which only lists victims through 1950.\n\nA couple of years later, Mobile's city government was changed by federal order, and Blacks were elected to city office for the first time since Reconstruction. Former Neighborhood Organized Workers member Fred Richardson has held a city council seat since 1997.\n\nIn 2005, Mobile elected Sam Jones as its first Black mayor. He served two terms and is now a state legislator.\n\nKarlos Finley's sister, Dora, was prominent in 2007's award-winning documentary The Order of Myths , a film exploring Mobile's mostly segregated Mardi Gras. Though she died in 2012, her name adorns Mobile's African American Heritage Trail, a chain of historic markers detailing achievement in the Black community.\n\nBryan Stevenson's book Just Mercy inspired Leah Nodar to return to grad school. A visit to the EJI website linked her to the Remembrance Project, where she is maybe its youngest member.\n\nNodar was at Mobile's largest Black Lives Matter protest in late May. Along with an estimated 1,000-plus people, she felt compelled by the systemic racism she perceives. She sees the Remembrance Project as related.\n\n\"I think understanding how racism functions today requires understanding how it functioned in the past, how the structures we currently have were built,\" Nodar said.\n\nBLM marchers also focused efforts on a statue of Confederate Adm. Raphael Semmes at Mobile's most prominent intersection. Semmes penned an unapologetic defense of the Confederacy rife with Lost Cause rationale-that the Confederacy fought over states' rights not slavery, that they protected Southern nobility against Northern barbarians, that Blacks were inferior beings. Mobilians gifted a house to the unrepentant rebel.\n\nSemmes' statue was erected in 1900, just as Alabama refashioned its state constitution to openly codify white supremacy. It was also the prime lynching era.\n\nThe 2020 protesters' ire was noted. The city administration removed the statue under darkness in violation of state code.\n\nOne historian hopes it's not the past revisited, of troubles swept away and ignored.\n\n\"The whole thing with the Semmes statue plays right into that right? [The mayor] took it down, quietly paid the $25,000 fine and we all move on,\" Messenger said.\n\nThe statue's empty pedestal is now the stump for the Lost Cause's once-expansive oak. Sadly, its roots still run deep after generations of penetration, as designed.\n\nAt the Aug. 10 Mobile County Commission meeting, Ludgood recommended that Mobile County stop observing Confederate holidays.\n\n\"The mood of the country has shifted, and we are coming to the recognition these Confederate holidays were code for white supremacy,\" Ludgood said.\n\nDespite stated empathy to her colleague's perspective, Commissioner Connie Hudson disagreed. She repeatedly noted \"sensitivity on both sides.\"\n\n\"There are citizens who feel this is part of history, part of their heritage,\" Hudson said. \"The vast majority, slavery issue aside, had ancestors who fought in 'The War Between the States' and the vast majority of those were not slaveholders. They were poor farmers who felt like they were protecting their homeland.\"\n\n\"You can't get away from the white supremacy that was the underlying motivation... just because someone feels like they ought to be able to honor ancestors who fought a war to keep my ancestors enslaved doesn't make it legitimate,\" Ludgood said.\n\nHudson called it \"a whole lot more complicated issue than that\" and noted, \"We can't change history.\"\n\nLudgood's recommendation died. Her resolve remained.\n\nDisclosure: This author has advised the Mobile County Remembrance Project on lynching research and copy-editing documents\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Meghan Markle Spoke Powerfully About Racism. Black Women Heard, and Know, Her Pain.\n\nEven with a seat at the royal table, Black people have to maintain awareness within our double consciousness. The philosophy is taken from W.E.B. Dubois that we live in parallel worlds: One where we can be our natural Black selves and another where we have to put those \"Black\" things away and adhere to what is acceptable in white society.\n\nNo matter our shade in the Crayola box, every Black person experiences the phenomenon. It's an education that we are never really taught, but we adapt nonetheless. However, that duality still does not negate the fact that Black people are always placed under harsher, hyper-focused critiques-all simply because of our lineage.\n\nIn her interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired Sunday night, Meghan Markle shed light on the British monarchy that was both shocking and, yet, not at all surprising about a 1,200-year-old institution. She shared her truly exhausting experiences of attempting to assimilate into royal life.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeghan told us that a member of the royal household raised concerns over how dark a then-unborn Archie's skin would be, and that this affected the level of security they would receive and whether Archie would be known as a prince. Racism in the family, and racism in the U.K., she and Harry told Oprah , helped drive them from the royal family. Meghan said she felt suicidal, that she had asked for help. She got nothing.\n\nInstead, in Britain this morning, her tormentors ( like Piers Morgan ) regrouped, and said the interview was \"race-baiting propaganda.\" Black people watch this, and can only roll our eyes as old patterns stubbornly re-establish themselves. \"This is racism,\" we say. \"Oh no, it isn't,\" white society replies, hands over ears, and gaslight at the ready.\n\n\"I realized that it was all happening just because I was breathing\"\n\nIn her interview, Meghan noted how there was no handbook on how to become a Royal, and, instead, she had to learn the nature of the beast on her own.\n\nThe royals essentially dictate who is allowed in their inner circle of high-profile aristocrats. Knowing the role of the United Kingdom's racist ventures in both slavery and colonialism, it's hardly a shocker that the Royal family would still be wary of anyone who is not white-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant joining their ranks.\n\nHowever, their lack of addressing their unconscious biases and even their tendencies to create outcasts out of their own family members shows just how archaic and disconnected the monarchy is.\n\nMeghan, who is biracial with a Black mother and white father, has encountered a number of hangups in regards to her race in the past. Before marrying into the Royal family, she worked as an actor and noted how her racial status affected her ability to get work.\n\n\"To describe something as being black and white means it is clearly defined,\" she wrote in an essay for Elle magazine in 2015. \"Yet when your ethnicity is Black and white, the dichotomy is not that clear. In fact, it creates a grey area. Being biracial paints a blurred line that is equal parts staggering and illuminating.\"\n\nIn the essay, she goes on to describe how she lost fans during her stint on the TV show Suits . When viewers realized that she was half Black, they were practically disgusted.\n\nAs a fair-skinned Black woman who has been compared to Meghan a million times (same skin tone, hair color, features, and we both have freckles), I, too, have dealt with this racial uncertainty since my childhood.\n\nThere were moments when I was not Black enough to fill the Black-quota, but I was still Black enough to be subject to racist interactions and oppressive experiences, for people to gaslight me and pass micro-aggressions that I'm \"so articulate.\"\n\nFriends who would come to visit me when I was a kid would judge the dinners made by my mother-who is a soul food legend in her own right-and say the meals were not interesting enough and boring. Hell, I remember the moment when I first realized I was Black because a girl in kindergarten told me that my hands were dirty.\n\nThroughout my life, white strangers have gone out of their way to question and touch my hair whether it was in its natural, curly state or styled in braids. As a beauty pageant contestant, I felt pressure from judges and coaches to do something with my hair, that it was too \"kinky\" to be worn down like other participants and it was part of the reason why I didn't win.\n\nAfter marrying Prince Harry and becoming the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan made clear to Oprah she felt she had been stripped of her identity. She revealed that she had given up her passport and keys for the sake of allowing the monarchy to fully engulf her in its control. Not long after her arrival, she became the target of racist smear campaigns in the British press.\n\nMeghan did not get the same treatment that her white sister-in-law, Kate Middleton, received as the wife of Prince William. Instead, as the only person of color within the royal family, Meghan constantly tried to find a way to defend herself from racist jabs in the media.\n\n\"I realized that it was all happening just because I was breathing,\" she told Oprah.\n\nUnfortunately, the royal family never stood up for Meghan to reverse all of the hurtful allegations and racist remarks that were made about her in the press. I see this as a moment of passive bigotry, like when a white person sees or hears another white person do or say something racist but doesn't correct it. Without the Royals intervening, they allowed racism to perpetuate on a global level.\n\nBrits like to say that racism in the United Kingdom doesn't operate like racism in the United States. People in the U.K. have been quick to criticize the States for our current race relations and publicized police brutality. But throughout this interview, we realize that racism in the U.S. and racism in her mother country are not all that different.\n\nMeghan's time with the British royalty led her to bouts of serious depression. She mentioned how her identity was stripped from her, and the situation became so dire that she no longer wanted to live. She was afraid of being left alone because she was unsure of what she would do to herself.\n\nShe asked the monarchy for help, that she wanted to see a professional in regards to her mental health. Meanwhile, the British royals were more concerned about the optics and how Meghan seeking a therapist would be a bad look for the monarchy.\n\nThe simple fact that Markle's identity was practically erased is already troubling. That is seen as the standard for anyone who marries into the royal family.\n\nHowever, that a Black woman from another country had to deal with this, made me immediately think of enslaved Africans after they disembarked from the Middle Passage. They were forced to lose any sense of self: Their language, religion, culture, customs were erased, and they were punished if they even showed a hint of trying to utilize them.\n\nMental health within the Black community is already complex, and Meghan's experiences battling racism and then being ignored about her concerns is something Black people have endured over and over. It's a never-ending cycle when we voice our frustrations but are told to just get over it or that the situation really is not that serious.\n\nThe difference here is that Meghan has the means and community outreach to receive that mental help or to even ask for it. Most Black people deal with overt and systemic racism that plagues our society and internalize it.\n\nIt affects everything within our being: mentally, emotionally, how we maneuver while we're around other people, how we raise our children-if we choose to bring children into this world knowing the unjust dangers they could face.\n\n\"I've advocated for so long for women to use their voice, and then I was silent.\"\n\nIn her talk with Oprah, Meghan explained how she championed women's independence.\n\n\"I've always worked,\" she said. \"I've always valued independence. I've always been outspoken, especially about women's rights. I mean, that's the sad irony of the last four years is I've advocated for so long for women to use their voice, and then I was silent.\"\n\nThere's a disturbing saying among Black people that we must \"work twice as hard to get half as far.\" Really, it speaks to the inequities that we face. No matter how experienced or educated we are, it still doesn't match up to our white counterparts. We can have more credentials on our resumés and a better education, but white colleagues will still receive priority over us for a new job, better pay, or a title promotion.\n\nThe former Suits star had a life and career before she became the wife of Prince Harry. She was her own person and, yet-as a royal-she was subject to the orders and demands of people who appear not as eloquent, educated, or intellectually cultured as she was. Meghan had to dumb herself down to make, essentially, her white colleagues feel less intimidated and play the part.\n\nShe already addressed that she gave up so much in order to become the Duchess of Sussex, but I'm sure she had no idea the capacity to which change would insult her intelligence.\n\nThe \"concern\"-what an awful, malign word!-over how dark her son's complexion would be after he was born remains one of the standout moments of the interview.\n\nThough neither she nor Harry provided full details of who said the comments or what else was mentioned, it's clearly implied that the baby's lineage played a part in him not being considered royal to the rest of the family.\n\nHistorically, Black Americans who were fair enough made the choice whether or not they wanted to pass for white. Three of the children President Thomas Jefferson had with enslaved Sally Hemings obscured into whiteness after leaving Monticello. It was a choice Black people made in order to survive in a racist world that would have subjected them to discrimination if they had otherwise adopted their Black ethnicity.\n\nSome people who passed would not have children out of fear that the child could take the skin color of an ancestor and reveal their secret.\n\nThe concept overall is unsettling considering that people had to lie about their lineage in order to be considered equals in a slave-holding or Jim Crow society. I have family members who did it well into the twentieth century, which goes to show that a lack of equity is still at play.\n\nEach time her grandchildren were born, my paternal grandmother (who was probably only a quarter-Black) commented about how dark their skin would become over time or how \"nappy\" their hair would get. The level of self-hate she harnessed is heartbreaking, but it's also understandable considering the world she came from.\n\nIn 2021, the monarchy claims that they're progressive and welcoming, that race is not a deciding factor on how they treat people or who is allowed within their tight-knit circle. But for them to show any concern about the complexion of an unborn child is beyond abhorrent, disgusting, and an indicator that the child won't receive the same privileges as his kin due to his skin color.\n\nTo me, it's too reminiscent of a Southern plantation owner having children with the Black women he enslaved and denying his offspring.\n\n\"We become a social project for people to learn to be more compassionate.\"\n\nHarry eventually joined Meghan and Oprah during the interview, where he confirmed the racism Meghan said she had endured from Buckingham Palace. He said he understood that he had unconscious biases and tried to enlighten himself before having a relationship with Meghan.\n\nHowever, he did not realize that there was more to the experience of being Black and surviving racism until after his marriage. And through it all, he understood how far-removed his family was from learning about other groups of people.\n\nI do commend Harry for educating himself and his attempt to be anti-racist. But if it was not for Meghan, would he still be gaslighting other Black people? People are quick to ignore issues or brush them off until they are directly affected. In this case, racism was a distance away from Harry until he married a biracial woman and, together, they would raise a mixed-race family.\n\nIt's truly bizarre, and a sign of a lack of personal and political evolution, that a major social issue is not an issue until it personally affects someone. Indeed, it seems selfish. At that point, the damage has already been done and a cleanup effort is being called in. It still cannot erase the feelings of inferiority that marginalized groups of people experience.\n\nHaving dated white men in the past, I felt that I had to scream at the top of my lungs for some of them to understand what it truly feels like to be oppressed. They would never fully grasp it, but maybe, just maybe I could paint them a picture that every day Black people are judged for how we dress, the way we talk, how we think, our history, even our DREAMS.\n\nOur entire beings are diminished, like we become a social project for people to learn to be more compassionate, and if they don't pass the test-no problem. It was just for extra credit anyway.\n\nListening to Meghan speak to the world on Sunday night was heartbreaking. I saw a Black woman at her core, battling to refind her natural strength. A powerful institution tried to mind-fuck her away from her foundation to remold her into the property that THEY wanted her to be.\n\nI can't help but give her respect for being an example. The fact that she survived a modern-day entrapment and was able to propel her story to an international stage is beyond-impressive. She has demanded change on a global level, and she is letting the world know its colonial past is still our present.\n\nIt's obvious that it's time for the British monarchy to dissolve-if not for the sake of its lack of popularity, then at least in order to acknowledge that there is no place for the institution in a developing world that demands racial justice. But Buckingham Palace is not unlike other holders of power; it's just one branch on the tree of oppression. Thankfully, Meghan has been able to use her position to highlight a necessary need for social change.\n\nSometimes, revolutions don't have to be marching in the streets. Sometimes, they need a more intimate setting where people can look within to discover how they're silencing others.\n\nRace and Identity Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "I love my white family, but there's an elegant joy in a room full of black faces\n\nThe power of being surrounded by black people is that the sheer sense of community is enough\n\nI t's rare that I've ever been fully surrounded by people who look like me, by black folks and faces. I was adopted into a white family, lived and went to school in a place where mine was the only black face for miles, I'm married to a white man (though he is a professor of race and history) and I have worked in a variety of mainstream media jobs where the majority, if not all, of my colleagues were white. The majority-black spaces that exist in America, few and far between, often feel as though they have been thrust upon us, rather than created by our design, as the validity of those spaces are constantly measured against the egregiously overvalued sanctuaries of mainstream whiteness.\n\nStill, when I am in a roomful of black people, or an all-black environment, I feel renewed, seen, held up and realized. A striking ease of proximity falls over me in a way that never exists in the rest of my life - even with my family. It's a tidy, elegant joy that runs through me like a kind of cultural poetry: succinct, distilled and mighty. Nobody tries to stifle or gloss over their concern about what it must feel like for me to be here, in this space. There are no quick glances of sudden regret at having said something potentially offensive or racist. It is a space where I will never be exoticized, and where any criticism of opinion or intellect comes from a place of infinite mercy.\n\nI love my family and they love me, of course, but throughout my life it has become increasingly clear that they did not, could not and do not understand why race and racism in America was and is so important for me to talk about and reckon with - or, in some cases, that I even experience racism at all.\n\nDuring holidays and family gatherings, I am always the one to bring up something in the news that has to do with race, because, in the country in which we live, the KKK still marched proudly in parts of the south after lawmakers voted to take down the Confederate flag. On the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, Republicans are still trying to find ways to make voting for black people difficult , if not impossible. More black men are incarcerated or under surveillance by the criminal justice system today than were enslaved during the 1850s (think about that for a minute).\n\nMicro-aggression racism is everywhere, all the time. Image after image on social media, in every possible form of media delivery, tells us that the only way to be good, the best, preferred, successful, smart is to be white. White strangers make unsolicited remarks about my hair as if it were a dazzling bird of paradise perched atop my head. Often when I bring up racial issues in white spaces, my family members, friends and/or colleagues answer with either silence or discomfort. Or worse, someone will say something that reveals their own racism. The assumption is alternately that I'm a black militant or that I represent all black people in America. My individualism is obscured.\n\nSo when we were invited to spend a recent holiday with one of my oldest and best girlfriends, Caryn, and her family, I was thrilled and relieved to think that my 10-year-old son, Kofi, and I would be in the company and comfort of blackness. With the relentlessness of black deaths, so many of them black men, at the hands of the police, it felt important that he spend time with Caryn's son, Kofi's close friend and peer whose skin is browner than his own: while my husband and I have discussed with Kofi what it means to be a young black male in America - and he has many black friends at school - I secretly hoped the two would talk privately amongst themselves about race in America, and give each other strength and encouragement in the process.\n\nWho was I kidding? I needed the strength and encouragement.\n\nWhat I didn't anticipate, though, was the form in which that strength and encouragement would come. Not once, from the time we arrived to the time that we left, did the issue of race come up in conversation. Instead, we took turns holding and cooing over the new god baby, laughing about old memories, taking pictures and talking recipes, cooking and serving each other meals, listening to Aunt Penny's stories and turning a blind eye to the big kids' all-day video game playing.\n\nWe didn't have to talk about race to bridge any divides. The power of being surrounded by black people is that the sheer sense of community is enough. I didn't feel the urgency to bring up the toxicity of racism that I did with my white family, because I felt constant, ongoing pushback to it - in the cadence of our content, the steadfast grip as we held hands to say grace, and the strength in our numbers."

      "text": "When is it OK for white people to ask about other people's ethnicity?\n\nWe all see colour, writes Sisonke Msimang . But instead of being seduced by the superficiality of exoticism, why not look for points of familiarity instead?\n\nDear Ms Understanding,\n\nI am curious about people's ethnicity but am never sure whether I'm allowed to ask (being a white Australian person) or how to ask. For example, if I'm working with someone who is dark skinned and I'm curious about what race they may have in their family tree, can I (and how do I) ask them?\n\nDear Curious,\n\nThank you for this question. I suspect a lot of white people will relate to your curiosity and with the awkwardness that comes with wanting to answer these questions without causing offence.\n\nBefore we begin, let me note that like a lot of people, you have used ethnicity and race interchangeably though they have different meanings . I'll accept your terminology because it is clear that you are referring to people with darker skin than yours - typically people of Indigenous, Arab, Asian, African or South American heritage.\n\nThere is no hard and fast rule about whether you can ask someone about their race, ethnicity or heritage but you should understand that your words will have consequences.\n\nThe person you are curious about would not be wrong to assume that you are asking them these questions solely based on their skin tone. I shared your questions with assistant professor Kathomi Gatwiri, one of Australia's leading Afro-diasporic scholars.\n\nGatwiri makes the point that \"If the question of the ethnicity of a Black person is the first thing that you would be curious about as soon as you meet them, then that can come off wrong and strong. It's not that Black people are offended by curiosity in general; it's that often Black people become fatigued with being only (maybe mostly) experienced in racial terms through the white gaze.\"\n\nGatwiri is referring to the cumulative tiredness of having been asked these questions countless times. It may be the first time you are asking this particular person about their ethnicity; but they will have encountered curiosity like yours many times before.\n\nIn addition, each time we answer, people of colour and Black folks are aware that we have to act as though we aren't annoyed - if we don't, we face a backlash. As Gatwiri notes, \"our irritation is often weaponised against us.\"\n\nThis means that even though answering all these questions can be burdensome, we have to operate as cultural ambassadors. Ultimately, the curiosity of white strangers comes at a cost, and makes many of us feel that our heritage will always be the first - and perhaps the only - point of interest, no matter how long we have lived in a place.\n\nAs Gatwiri notes, however, the bigger question to ask yourself is: \"What is driving your curiosity? Are you also curious about all the people you encounter or just dark-skinned people?\"\n\nTo be fair, I hear from many white people that they are curious about racial or ethnic background because they want to connect with people of colour and make them feel welcome. In other words, their questions are based on goodwill, on a charitable instinct rather than malintent.\n\nAs a general rule, no matter who I am meeting, I assume we have something in common and I ask open-ended questions that move us in the direction of finding points of connection. At the moment, your questions are geared towards exploring difference.\n\nGatwiri reminds us that \"Questions that touch on who we are must be relational. The goal here is to learn how to build relationships that offer a trustworthy enough context through which asking certain questions is not only permissible but also celebrated.\n\n\"My aim here is not to discourage you from asking such questions but rather to encourage you to prioritise a relationship ahead of your curiosity. You can interrogate your curiosity by asking: 'Do I need to know this, or do I want to know this?'. Finally, you can ask yourself: 'Have I earned the right to know this information about this person?'\"\n\nThis point is so important. It may sound counterintuitive, but true curiosity is based a desire to find what is familiar, rather than to scrutinise what is exotic. I wonder what would happen if you interacted with people without being held hostage to your curiosity about their skin tone?\n\nI am not suggesting that you try to ignore race - we all see colour. Instead, I'm urging you to put race in its proper place; to see it and resist being seduced by its superficiality.\n\nIf you focus on getting to know people slowly, and in good time, you might find out that the darker-skinned person you have just met is an early riser, just like you. And as you discuss the joys of watching first light and the awe of sunrise, your new acquaintance might just reveal that they grew up on a farm outside Caracas, waking up when the cock crowed. Imagine the delight of discovering where someone is from without having to ask: \"Hey, so what's your heritage\"?\n\nWhatever your background, people have many questions around race and racism that can sometimes be difficult to ask. It might be how to handle racialised treatment in the workplace, how to best stand up for a friend or even what to do if you think you have upset someone. Sisonke Msimang can help you figure it out. Questions can be anonymous.\n\nSisonke Msimang is a Guardian Australia columnist.

      "text": "What I'm thinking about ... forgiveness and healing\n\nBetween 1910 and 1970 the Australian government forcibly removed over a 100,000 Aboriginal children, some as young as a few months old, from their parents. These children, known as the stolen generations , were given to white families to raise, or sent to orphanages because the government did not think that their parents were capable of raising them. At 18, they were released into \"white\" society, often with no awareness of who their biological parents were and with no way of finding them.\n\nThe first time I heard this story, I had goosepimples. I was also very upset. Surely, terrible things happened in life, but this one haunted me for weeks, sending me nightmares when I slept. However, as is usual with life, other events overtook this and I no longer thought of the stolen children every day. Their story became peripheral to other news, so much so that I forgot they existed. On the plane down to Adelaide , I thought of the heat, of beaches, of wild game: everything I associated with the country I was visiting for the first time except its indigenous people.\n\nHowever at the opening event of the Writers' Week , I was forced to think of the Aborigines and of that dark period of Australia's history when reference was made to the fact that we were standing on Aboriginal land. An Aboriginal chief welcomed us and offered up generous prayers for us. He was the first Aborigine I ever saw. I wondered if he was one of the stolen ones. The goosepimples came back. The anger returned and threatened to stop me from enjoying the event.\n\nI have spent all week in Adelaide, at one of the best lit fests I have ever had the good fortune to attend, thinking not just of the stolen children, but of the Aborigines in general. Marginalised in their own country, wronged on so many different levels , the annual \"Sorry Day\" seems almost farcical. Although I have read some accounts of some Aborigines finding consolation and healing in it, I have always thought some things too big to be forgiven. Colonisation for example.\n\nI imagined that the Aborigines I came across in the city all looked burdened with pain and anger. Their sadness looked infinite. I wondered how anyone could think that they could begin to heal. There are things done to me that I could not imagine that I could be healed of because I did not think that I could forgive.\n\nHowever, today, an Aboriginal woman came to me to have her book signed at the end of my reading event. She was tall, elegant, beautiful. She did not look upset. She said how much she enjoyed my session. Then she asked if I had been welcomed properly on Aboriginal land. She said a short prayer and welcomed me. She said more than once, \"this is our land\". In her voice was pride rather than resentment. Then she told me she was a writer as well. I did not ask her what she wrote but I was so intrigued by her that once the last person in the queue left, I went and purchased her book.\n\nI am reading that book now. A memoir. A touching story of a young girl taken from her family to be raised by white strangers. Her own father, a stolen boy raised in a home for boys in the city. Generations separated from their natural families by cruel government policies. I am skipping pages, not reading chronologically. The last sentence of the book is \"Together we will be there always, turning the past hurts into healing.\" I know I will cry. This week in Adelaide has touched me much more profoundly than I could ever have imagined."

      "text": "I Wanna Be Yours review - a love story with heady chemistry\n\nBush theatre, London Ragevan Vasan and Emily Stott star as a couple pulled apart by their backgrounds in this play by slam poet Zia Ahmed\n\nT he question of how to build intimacy across the divides of our supposedly multicultural society is both urgently topical and achingly familiar, as demonstrated by Zia Ahmed 's neat three-hander at the Bush's studio theatre. Ahmed, a London-based poetry slam champion, avoids look-at-me poetics in a wise little story about a Yorkshire actress (Ella) and a Muslim poet (Haseeb) who fall in love after she is hired to brush up his performance skills.\n\nThe challenge of the piece is to expose social cliche without succumbing to it, and by the time Haseeb is mistaken for a drug dealer for the third time, I was beginning to fear the worst. But gradually it becomes clear that repetition is precisely the problem. Whether he is clubbing or childminding, white strangers will always misjudge Haseeb on the basis of his skin colour; he in turn will forever feel alienated by the rooms full of white faces with which his choices - both of partner and of vocation - confront him.\n\nAt first, the couple are too swept up in love's young dream to care but, as Ahmed makes clear, all relationships exist in a social sphere. Through the black comedy of awkward family encounters - on Haseeb's side as well as Ella's - they are increasingly unable to ignore the surreally inflating elephant in their bedroom: cultural difference.\n\nWhile the storyline is unsurprising, the execution is exquisite. Anna Himali Howard's bare-stage touring production for Paines Plough and Tamasha makes ingenious use of sign language to ironise and amplify as well as to translate. Rachael Merry, the BSL signer, becomes a third person in the relationship, flitting gracefully between the couple. Her mobile features mirror the emotions they cannot own, while her hands dance out the farce of miscommunication and social embarrassment.\n\nIt is a very clever device that creates the illusion of a wider society, freeing Ragevan Vasan and Emily Stott to concentrate on the interiority of the relationship between sweet, ardent Haseeb and passionate, defiant Ella. Initially, they seem an unlikely couple. But as they circle each other and the stage, buffeted hither and thither by tiffs and reconciliations, a heady chemistry develops between them that makes you yearn for their romance to survive, even as you suspect it won't.\n\nAt Bush theatre, London , until 18 January."

      "text": "Oscar wild card\n\nIf the producers of the Oscars wanted to boost ratings this year (and they certainly do), then they have already got what they wanted by picking the lithe form of Chris Rock as their host.\n\nFew other choices could have created more headlines, more anticipation, more of that elusive Hollywood 'buzz' than the black New Yorker once dubbed by Time as 'the funniest man in America'.\n\nHe has already served up a heady dish of pre-Oscar controversy of the type frowned on in public but secretly lusted after by movie executives desperate to pump life into an awards ceremony showing signs of ailing health.\n\nRock is famed for his non-stop swearing. His act is littered with profanities and impossible to quote from without saying 'fuck' or 'nigga'. His routines lob comic grenades at every conceivable American sacred cow, from white racism to black criminality. Rock has never failed to raise the hackles of conservatives and liberals alike. He is a guaranteed, living, walking and breathing controversy. Just what Oscar ordered.\n\nRock has already done his duty. In pre-ceremony interviews he has promised to give black actor Jamie Foxx an award no matter what ('Jamie is not going to walk out of that place without an Oscar') and slated Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator ('a story about a rich guy who gets things done'). He has slammed the ceremony as a 'fashion show' and says, as a straight black male, that it holds no interest for him. Mindful of his reputation, the organisers have arranged for Rock's Oscar ceremony for the first time to be broadcast with a five-second time delay.\n\nBut in truth it is a cynical game. And that probably suits Rock just fine. Chris Rock is far more complex than a simple potty-mouthed iconoclast. His is the story of one of the most talented comics in America still being constrained by a society that judges him by his race. Rock is savvy enough to know that the Oscar ceremony could finally allow him to break those bonds and rise to the A-list stardom his colour-blind talent deserves.\n\nBut Rock's biggest secret is also his most surprising. Behind all the 'niggas' and angry posturing is a 40-year-old man from one of the most unsung of American social types: the solid working class black family whose values of hard work, obeying the law and bettering oneself are as mainstream as Apple Pie. Far from being a threat to traditional American values, Rock is an unlikely celebration of them.\n\nChris Rock was born in the South, but is a child of New York. His parents hailed from small-town South Carolina and their eldest child (of six) was born on a trip home. But Rock himself grew up in the then tough Brooklyn neighbourhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant.\n\nIt was a place familiar from news reports as a ghetto of crime and drugs. But that is where the stereotype of Rock's black urban childhood ends. There was no troubled upbringing for Rock. His mother Rose was a schoolteacher and his father Julius was a truck driver for the New York Daily News . The family was strict but loving. It imbued Rock with a sense that anything was possible. He frequently quips about telling his mother he wanted to be President one day: 'She said: \"They don't pay you that well and if you're black they'll shoot you.\"'\n\nThat may be a joke but it is a revealing glimpse into the sort of quietly ambitious home Rock grew up in.\n\nBut though Rock had escaped the racism of the South, he still came across the colour divide in New York. In a perhaps misguided attempt to give their son the best start in life, Rock was bussed out of his home neighbourhood to a white school 45 minutes away in upmarket Bensonhurst. It was a disaster.\n\nAlmost from day one he was beaten, spat on and called names by his white classmates. No physical giant (he weighs about 10 stone), Rock found that he could make his tormentors laugh. Like so many comics Rock's genius for humour was born as a survival instinct in a hostile environment.\n\nEven now Rock admits to still being nervous around white strangers. On rare occasions he can get panic attacks and nosebleeds in a room full of white people he does not know. That is an amazing thing given his astonishing stage presence and act. To see Rock live is to witness a man utterly in his element. He prowls the stage like a lion pacing its cage; his strange voice, part rasping, part scream, can fill a huge auditorium. He is fearless in his assaults on every aspect of American society. He tears down icons both left and right. His jokes make uncomfortable reading for many. One famous riff on abortion manages uniquely to appal conservatives and feminists at the same time: 'Abortion, it's beautiful. It's beautiful abortion is legal,' Rock says with a grin before going in for the punch line: 'I love going to an abortion rally to pick up women 'cos you know they are fucking.'\n\nBut Rock's most famously controversial routine is his constant barrage against 'niggas', which he defines as the opposite of 'black people'. Niggas commit crime, take drugs, have too many children and live up to a media stereotype of feckless youth. Black people are... well, hardworking people just like him. 'Everything white people don't like about black people, black people don't like about black people,' he once said. Or, more comically, at the end of a riff slamming black people who complain (probably justifiably) about their unfair media portrayal, Rock says bluntly: 'When I go to the money machine at night, I ain't looking over my back for the media. I'm looking for niggas.'\n\nIt is an attitude born in his own family. Bedford-Stuyvesant may have been tough, but Rock's parents stayed together. Rock was no drug dealer, like so many rap stars. Instead he took menial jobs at McDonald's as he slaved away at giving birth to his comedy career. His humour (and his anger) is born of a fierce pride in his blue collar roots and the achievements he and his family won through sheer hard work. Ironically, it has much in common with President George W Bush's frequent railing against the 'bigotry of low expectations' that he says defines liberal attitudes to black Americans.\n\nRock is a world away from the glamorisation of crime so prevalent in the hip-hop music that is the most public face of popular black culture. One of his best known sketches last year featured a parody instruction video called 'How Not To Get Your Ass Kicked by the Police'. Rock's advice: 'Follow these easy tips. First, obey the law!'\n\nIt is an attitude that can infuriate some liberals. The New Republic magazine once devoted 4,000 words criticising Rock as 'reactionary' and reliant on 'coon comedy'. But in truth Rock is no slouch when it comes to racial matters. He has recently been furious that some people believe he is the first black Oscar host (Whoopi Goldberg and Richard Pryor have both been there before him). In fact Rock's own career, like every black comic, has always been essentially defined by race. After working his way through the tough world of 'open mike' sets in New York's comedy world he was discovered by no less a black comic luminary then Eddie Murphy.\n\nFrom there he graduated to Saturday Night Live , the TV show that acts as a launchpad for countless comedy careers. From there he took to the road and burst into the mainstream in 1996 with a series of shows on the cutting edge HBO channel. Accolades and awards have followed, but essentially Rock's career has been treading water for several years. While his white SNL contemporaries, such as Adam Sandler, have rocketed into the celebrity stratosphere, Rock's career has been stalled as a black comic. It is not for want of trying.\n\nIronically, Rock begged director Michael Mann for the part in Collateral that Foxx turned into an Oscar-nominated role. Rock's own movie career now spans 22 films in 15 years, ranging from art house films like Dogma to churned out 'profile boosters' such as Beverly Hills Ninja.\n\nNone has brought him great acclaim. In interviews Rock frequently rails at the stereotyped roles he is offered and speaks openly of his ambition to work with Woody Allen (so far to no avail).\n\nIt is hard not to imagine that it is Rock's race, and his desire to play a role where his colour would be irrelevant, that is keeping him pigeonholed away from the big time.\n\nFor the truth is Rock is middle-aged.

      "text": "We Come With This Place by Debra Dank review - a jewel to rival Australia's great desert memoirs\n\nBeauty and pain intertwine as Dank deftly weaves the story of her family, ancestors and country\n\nD ebra Dank is a Gudanji and Wakaja woman and a mother, grandmother and educator. These are important biographical notes, because this book is about all those qualifiers that not only make the author who she is, but root the overall story and guide its purpose.\n\nPart memoir, part bush guide and customs manual, this is a book to lean into and take time with. Foremost, this is a story to learn from. In her introduction, Dank calls it \"a strange kind of letter, written to my place\", and yet that strange weaving back and forth through time and dimension adds to the reader's experience.\n\nWe Come With This Place is a jewel of a book, one Australians in particular ought to read and refer to. In this way, it belongs alongside iconic desert memoirs, like Ninu - Grandmother's Law, by Nura Nungalka Ward, about the life of a Yankunytjatjara woman from the Central Desert; and Two Sisters, the story of Walmajarri siblings Ngarta and Jukuna leaving the Great Sandy Desert.\n\nDank takes her time at the opening of the story. She tells you about the land she grew up on - a character in itself, and all its dust and broken rock - but that's just a small part of the whole: there's so much more to that stretch of country in far-west Queensland, across the Barkly Tableland and to the Gulf of Carpentaria. She was born the black kid of a black stockman, which is an omnipresent fact in her family's lives, and the threat of Bjelke-Petersen's Queensland in the 1950s and 60s hangs overhead. The invisible menace is wrought in the imagery of a sudden locust cloud that engulfs their van out to Oban station, and the fish-filled sky that rains writhing perch all over Camooweal's barren streets.\n\nThere is a heaviness felt throughout the book, of being stolen, going missing, and accidental death too - Dank's was a childhood of discovery and keen observation, both of the beauty and the brutality of rural Australian life. Hungry and thirsty people and animals litter the pages; the emancipated cattle gathering around a dwelling, or the extreme rationing of fresh water.\n\nThis is also the story of family - of Dank's, of her siblings, her parents, her grandparents and her ancestors through time; of Bungmaji and the three Mararamana, the water women, and others. Many stories centre on the fascination, forgiveness and adoration of a troubled parent. Notably of Dank's father, Soda, whose story follows the timeless tracks as he escapes station owners and mission priests, and traverses hot country with a small stone or hard seed where \"the presence of the foreign body produced water in his mouth\". We see him as he dances, jokes with his children, works endlessly, and suffers too. There's his reunion with his birth mother, Lucy, and the unspeakable crimes he witnesses in that moment before they are separated once again.\n\nDank is particularly skilled at showing the outback through children's eyes and hearts: the magical fish, the things that can poison, the mangled yellow bodies of grasshoppers, the farming accidents - in this case, a man sucking the tip of a carbine light, and ending up \"without his brain\". The red-meat ant bite and the unexpected and confusing kindness of white strangers are stories told side-by-side; everything, it seems, has beauty and pain intertwined. There's the food and drink that binds time, place and joy into their broken hearts - the story of the conkerberries (bush plum), mamugujama in Gudanji language, \"so favoured by us all, including the turkeys\". And the gorgeous story of Dank's grandfather plucking five perch from a secret hole in the desert, where she discovers \"how we could take fish from cold water in arid places\".\n\nThere are quiet revelations found in fresh and saltwater, and the melding of each in her marriage to a white fella, and in returning with her adult children to country where her son is so eager to remove his shoes, for his feet to breathe on the bank; as he puts it, \"my feet have felt all those things here before\".\n\nIn the end, Dank reckons with the violence that was never meant to enter her family tree, but did, and she overcomes it. It's as if these enormous heartbreaks have lodged in her own mouth as a child, unwilling to say so many things aloud. Here, in the privacy and the communion of the page, Dank's voice is heard clearly and courageously, and we, readers, fellow inhabitants of this country, are all the more enriched because this book was written.\n\nWe Come With This Place by Debra Dank is out now through Echo Publishing"

      "text": "'I never really thought I'd be alive at this point': Munroe Bergdorf on how she fell back in love with life\n\nShe's the model, writer and trans activist who has been abused in her private life and vilified in public. Now she is revealing all in her new memoir - and explains why writing it was the most brutal form of therapy\n\nA t the age of 13, Munroe Bergdorf was a swimming sensation. But in her memoir, she barely devotes a sentence to her feats in the pool, merely saying she swam at national level, was ranked 11th in the country and didn't have her heart in it. That's all. She doesn't tell us whether she enjoyed swimming, trained hard or dreamed of competing in the Olympics. Not even her stroke of choice or distance. Now I'm curious. Fancy being so brilliant at something yet so indifferent to it that it barely merits a mention in your life story.\n\nSo I ask, and it all pours out. She swam the 50m backstroke, won race after race for her all-boys school, and hated every minute of it. Not the swimming (that was fine), but the culture. \"Going to meets, the boys would all have fun together on the bus and I'd sit at the back,\" she says. \"I was never part of the squad. I was just there to bring the average of the team up. All of my teammates hated me.\" It says so much about how she viewed the world, and how the world viewed her.\n\nSwimming was not the only sport she excelled in. She was the school's top high jumper and a gifted middle-distance runner. Did she take pride in her achievements? \"Not really. Not when teachers are poking fun at the way you move, and calling you a nancy boy because you're running away from the ball because you don't want to play rugby.\"\n\nFast forward 23 years, and Bergdorf is a renowned model, writer and activist. She was the first trans person to appear on the cover of Cosmopolitan UK and to be hired ( and fired and eventually rehired ) by the cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Her achievements are indisputable. As are the many attacks she has been subject to. Bergdorf has been vilified in public for her views on race and gender, and abused in her private life. It's not been an easy ride.\n\nHer memoir, out this week, has been a long time in the making. She signed the book deal almost four years ago, but admits writing it has been a struggle. Not least because it's such a painful story to tell. \"It's been the most brutal form of therapy I can fathom,\" she says.\n\nIt feels appropriate that the book is coming out now - the debate about transgender rights has never been so high profile or heated. In the latest census for England and Wales, only 0.2% of the population identified as transgender (equally split between men and women), but the issue has caused a mighty schism between Scotland and the rest of Britain. While arguments rage in Westminster and the Scottish parliament over the Scottish government's gender recognition reform bill , drafted to make it easier for people to transition, we've heard remarkably little from trans people themselves. Which, Bergdorf tells me, is a huge part of the problem.\n\nW e meet at a hotel in Soho, London. Bergdorf is strikingly beautiful, with an extraordinary stillness to her. Even when she cries - which she does more than once in the couple of hours we chat - she retains that stillness. And yet her anxiety is soon apparent. Congratulations on the book, I say. \"Thank you. What did you think?\" she replies, with a sense of urgency verging on panic. \"I'm really nervous. When you lay your life out there for people to consume it's nerve-racking.\" And she really does lay her life out here. It's part confessional, part manifesto and part philosophical treatise - a guide to how we can all live together without tearing each other apart (with plenty of examples of how she has been torn apart, and torn herself apart, to get here).\n\nTransitional is a clever, moving book that packs a lot into its 194 pages. Yes, this is a story about Bergdorf's transition from he to she, but more importantly it's about any number of transitions that we all go through in life - culturally, politically, financially, intellectually, socially, you name it. As she says, barely a day passes when we don't evolve, or transition, in some way.\n\nBergdorf, aged 36, grew up in Stansted Mountfitchet, a conservative middle-class village in Essex. Her working-class parents had done well for themselves (her white British mother had a senior job in financial PR, her black Jamaican father was a carpenter) and moved from London to Stansted. There were hardly any other black people in the neighbourhood, though this was never discussed when she was growing up. Her parents liked to think they were the perfect fit.\n\nShe was happy at primary school, but as she grew up she became increasingly alienated from her peers. \"Once gender roles were introduced and the girls and boys started dividing, I didn't really have a place because I was too girly for the boys and I wasn't a girl - or seen as a girl. So I was ostracised, and the ostracism never stopped until I left high school.\" Her own family struggled with her sexuality and gender dysphoria. Her father, in particular, found it hard to accept that his son wanted to be a girl.\n\nShe was at school during the era of section 28 , legislation introduced by Margaret Thatcher that banned schools from \"promoting\" homosexuality. In reality, this meant that teachers were terrified of even discussing sexuality, let alone trans issues. Meanwhile, Munroe was beginning to realise her skin was political; that she was judged for its colour. In 1999, the Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and subsequent botched investigation by the Metropolitan police was published. The report concluded that the Met was institutionally racist. Neither her father nor brother discussed it at home. It didn't seem relevant to their lives. But when she visited her extended family in London, it was a different story. They knew exactly why Stephen and his friend Duwayne Brooks were attacked without provocation by white strangers - it was blind hatred. They understood that they could have been the victims of the attack just as easily as Stephen. And so did Bergdorf, because as an effeminate black boy she was particularly vulnerable.\n\nBergdorf grew into a sad, angst-ridden teenager. While her struggles prevented her from excelling academically, she did well enough to win a place at the University of Brighton to study English. When she left home, she says, she was reborn. Did she finally feel she belonged when she got to university? She corrects me, gently. \"I felt I belonged in Brighton . I didn't go to university for reasons of academia, I went to start a different life.\"\n\nIn Brighton, she began her transformation into the Munroe Bergdorf we see today, experimenting initially with clothes and makeup. After university, she worked for three years in fashion PR, then co-founded the queer rave Pussy Palace in London's Brick Lane. At the age of 24, she began using hormones to transition and later had surgery. In her book, she is deliberately vague about what procedures she has undergone. Is she saying it's none of our business? \"Basically, yes. It's obvious that I've had surgery. It's the first thing you see about me.\"\n\nDo people ask? \"They do, but I don't normally feel I have to give them an answer.\" She pauses. \"If another trans girl asks me, I will talk about it, because if it can help her feel as good as I feel within myself, then I will disclose what doctors I've gone to and what procedures I've had, but I also don't want to feed into the narrative for young trans people that in order to feel complete they have to have these surgeries.\"\n\nThe one thing Bergdorf does talk about in detail is facial feminisation surgery. In 2018, she underwent a series of procedures, including re-contouring of the chin and brow bone. For most trans women, she says this matters so much more than what they do or don't do downstairs. \"It's my priority, because I show it to the world. But the ins and outs of what I've had done, I don't talk about.\" She hopes the book is more about interiors than exteriors. People can see for themselves what she looks like. She wants to show us what it feels like to be her; what it has taken to get where she is today.\n\nShe nibbles at a pain aux raisins and tells me that the joy of her student years didn't last. She spent much of her 20s in chaos. Transition brought new challenges. There were so many dysfunctional relationships with men who fetishised her as a trans woman and despised themselves for doing so, she says. Invariably, their self-loathing ended up expressing itself in acts of violence towards Bergdorf.\n\nIn the book, she describes a terrifying sexual assault by a man she met on a night out who pushed cocaine up her nose and into her mouth as he raped her. \"When you look at someone and you know they want to kill you, and they don't see you as human enough to respect you when you say no, you don't want to have sex with them, and rape you anyway, that just kills a part of you.\" She chokes up. \"I don't know how I can unsee that. I still struggle to think of that period because I lost all hope. After that, I started hating myself a lot and entered abusive relationships because I didn't think I deserved any more.\" You went looking for them? \"I wasn't looking for them, but what I was attracted to wasn't healthy. I'd see people who would display controlling behaviour as somebody who cared. I just wasn't in a good place.\" That's awful, I say. She smiles and sniffs up her tears. \"It wasn't great.\"\n\nShe says her story is the story of so many trans women - dysfunctional relationships, abuse, seeking solace in drugs and alcohol, mental health collapsing. At one point she was so worried that she called the police to protect her from herself.\n\nNot surprisingly, this period of her life was particularly tough to write about. Transitional has helped put it in context, she says. \"I do feel proud of myself for getting through it and for taking something positive from it. For a long time, I struggled to see the upside.\"\n\nDid she think she would get through it? \"It was touch and go. There was a lot I didn't put in the book. Put it that way.\" Did you try to take your life? The words don't come, so she nods. More than once? She nods again. I'm glad you didn't, I say. \"So am I. Don't make me cry!\" She laughs - just about.\n\nWhile she was becoming increasingly desperate within herself, her public profile was growing - drag queen, DJ, model, columnist. In 2014, the Evening Standard referred to her as a \" cornerstone of London's trans scene \". And the more that was written about her, the less she really understood who she was. She began to believe her own press, whether good or bad. Then in 2017, she was hired by L'Oréal. When the cosmetics giant got in touch, she initially assumed it was a joke. But sure enough, they really did want her to be their first transgender model. Then, barely before she had signed her contract, she was sacked for comments she had written on Facebook before getting the job.\n\nBergdorf was responding to news of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia where neo-Nazi James Alex Fields Jr drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring many and killing 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer . Bergdorf had posted a comment on Facebook saying that \"all white people\" were racist \"from microaggressions to terrorism\", the white race was \"the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth\" and that white \"existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour\".\n\nFacebook removed the posts from its site, regarding them as being in contravention of its rules against hate speech, while L'Oréal issued a statement that it \"supports diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion\" and that Bergdorf's comments about white people were \"at odds with those values\".\n\nIt perhaps wasn't the most balanced or calm way of expressing your point, I say. \"Well, would you expect people who are heavily traumatised by racism to be balanced and calm?\" she fires back. \"The idea that people should speak about the trauma and oppression they have experienced in a way that is digestible for people who don't experience it ... I mean, I was angry. We were watching one of the most violent displays of racism in recent history. It was horrendous. Of course I was angry, and I think I had a right to be.\"\n\nIt wouldn't have had such impact if you'd expressed yourself in a more measured manner, I say. \"Well, exactly.\" Although Bergdorf's comments drew widespread criticism, there was huge support for her from those who believed it was outrageous that she had been labelled racist for calling out racism. \"I was the fall guy. In retrospect, I'm happy it happened because it did push the conversation forward. It got a lot of people talking. It went all over the world.\" But at the time she was terrified by the response. \"The amount of death threats and rape threats ... I saw a really dark side of humanity .\n\nSign up to Inside Saturday\n\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I was scared to go under the water when I was in the bath because I was convinced someone would hold me under. Things go through your head that you would never think of if you hadn't gone through that.\" Because of the threats? \"Yeah. People said they knew where I lived, that they were going to attack me with acid, that they would get me when I least expected it. It was endless.\" Two years ago, she left Twitter saying it was an unsafe place for transgender people, and that social media companies \"won't, rather than can't\" clamp down on transphobia.\n\nT he L'Oréal incident was a turning point for Bergdorf. It came close to breaking her, but ultimately it proved her salvation. After a lifetime's self-sabotage, she fought for herself like never before - for her career, her reputation, her life. \"Until that point, I was fighting against myself, whether it was the relationships I was in, or how I was treating myself with drink and drugs. Then, when my life moved into the public eye, I was forced to level up and start fighting for myself. I was on my own side for the first time.\"\n\nIn 2020, after t he racist killing of George Floyd in America, Bergdorf criticised L'Oréal Paris for posting on Instagram that it stood in solidarity with the black community. She said she had never received an apology for the way she had been treated by the company. In response, L'Oréal did apologise and invited Bergdorf on to its new Inclusion Advisory Board. She accepted, and is still working with the company today.\n\nIs this an example of the other kinds of transition she refers to in the book? \"I think so. It was transitioning out of an experience that didn't benefit anybody. I don't want to be at odds with the biggest beauty brand in the world for the rest of my life, and they obviously don't want to be seen in a bad light. They have offered me a way to move forward, to understand where they went wrong, and to better improve the practices of their company, and I can be part of that. That's a positive thing all round. Where cancel culture goes wrong is when people don't really want to find a resolve, they just want to cast people out of the kingdom or demonise people continually even when they have shown they want to make amends.\"\n\nWhile dealing with the L'Oréal fallout, Bergdorf also found herself fighting on another front. The issue of trans women had become the surprising battleground on which the culture war was being fought in Britain. Younger generations have been pitted against older; Westminster against the Scottish parliament. While Bergdorf and her allies argue that trans rights are on a par with previous battles for racial and sexual equality, gender-critical activists argue that trans women threaten the safety of biological women, and the sanctity of single-sex spaces.\n\nAlthough Bergdorf is appalled by the fact that the trans community has been weaponised by politicians, she's not surprised. We've seen it all before, she says. \"Whenever there are gains made from a marginalised community, there is always a pushback. Just before black people gained civil rights, there was a war.\" And are we in the middle of a war now? \"Definitely. There is definitely a war on trans people. It's not a civil war, but it's a war within the media. It's a war on trans people, and we are fighting literally for our lives.\"\n\nAs for the government, Bergdorf believes it is targeting trans people as a distraction. \"The trans community is too small to pander to but big enough to exploit for the Conservative government, and the Conservative government has always needed an enemy. The Tories function within an environment of fear, especially with the need to deflect from their own shortcomings. This is what we're seeing from Rishi Sunak in a time of multiple crises focusing on a community that he should be helping. There are so many issues that the trans community is facing, but we are being painted as the issue.\"\n\nA week after Bergdorf and I meet, Sunak announces that his government will try to block Scotland's gender recognition reform bill, which was passed by the Scottish parliament in December. The bill reduces the minimum age for transitioning from 18 to 16, eradicates the need for a psychiatric diagnosis of gender dysphoria in order to obtain a gender recognition certificate, and reduces the time people have to live in their acquired gender before applying for a certificate from two years to three months for those over 18 and six months for people aged 16 and 17. It's the first time Westminster has tried to stop a Scottish bill becoming law since the Scottish parliament was established in 1999.\n\nWhile we see any number of politicians and commentators discussing trans rights, Bergdorf points out that trans people have been notable for their absence in the debate on their future. The reasons are twofold, she says - the trans community in general doesn't trust mainstream media, and mainstream media has not prioritised hearing trans voices. The result is unsatisfactory at best. Imagine if the same were true for other minorities, she says. \"We're not looking to white people to be the authority on the black experience.\" Meanwhile, Bergdorf says, Britain's most vulnerable minority are continuing to die at an alarming rate.\n\nA few years ago, Bergdorf was asked in front of a live audience when she had \"come out\". She replied she'd done so three times - first as gay, then trans and most recently as pansexual. Back then, the term pansexual was less familiar, so she helped the audience with a definition. \"I'll sleep with anybody - if I find you attractive, and we've got a connection, it's fair game!\" she said. It got a big laugh. On public platforms Bergdorf can be po-faced and intense (largely because she is being interrogated), but she can also be very funny.\n\nIn Transitional, she says the first functional, loving relationship she has had was with Ava, a trans woman she dated for three years. Bergdorf has a tiny cross tattooed on her right wrist. She got it on a day trip to Brighton with Ava, who got a matching one. Transitional is dedicated to Ava's memory. I ask Bergdorf what happened to her, fearing the worst. She seems thrown by the question, and edges her way to an answer. \"Erm ... erm ... she passed away in summer.\" How old was she? \"She was 33.\" Was she ill or did she take her life? Bergdorf looks distraught. She tries to answer, but an anguished noise comes out of her mouth, part groan, part wail. \"She took her own life,\" she says eventually.\n\n\"I'm still processing it,\" she says. Now her anger is unmistakable. \"I just don't know what these people think they're doing. We're being talked about like we're a hypothetical, like we're not real, like it doesn't affect us, and we're burying our loved ones because of it. People are losing their lives because of it.\" Was that the case with Ava? \"I wasn't there. When someone takes their own life I'm sure there are a number of reasons, but I know the current climate had an impact on her. Just like it's having an impact on every trans person in the country. She was the first person I ever loved truly. I can't imagine my life having not met her.\" Tears are streaming down her cheeks. \"I'm sorry. It's really fresh. She had so much to live for. How many people are going to die, and how many people are going to end up in situations like I've been in where they can't love themselves, because the environment they are in encourages them to hate themselves? I'm really, really tired of it, because when I have to bury my ex-girlfriend and see her family in pieces, I don't even really have the words for it. People think there is no consequence for their actions because they don't even see us as human beings.\" She finally comes to a stop, sniffs back more tears and apologises. \"There really are no words. I'm heartbroken. The way that it happened is no way that anybody should go.\"\n\nWe sit in silence for a while. I'm searching for a positive. I ask Bergdorf which of the many transitions she has made that she's most proud of. She smiles, and says despite everything there have been so many recently.\n\nIt's only a year since she was last hospitalised with anxiety and depression, but she truly believes she's turned the corner. For the past 18 months, she has been in a relationship with a British chef who works in France. \"This is the first relationship I've had with a man that feels healthy and wholesome and encouraging. He's incredible.\" She shows me a picture of him, handsome, topless and blond, alongside her miniature Yorkie (a bitch called Teddy). She's obviously proud of both of them. And then there's her greatly improved relationship with her parents. Over the past few years her father has opened up about the racism he experienced in Britain. \"He told me that a woman who worked in the corner shop would never put money in his hand,\" she says. \"She refused to touch him. She would always put money on the counter.\" They now have a much better understanding of each other.\n\nWhat about the swimming - has she swum competitively since school? \"No! Nonono!\" I stopped swimming competitively when I started having gender dysphoria at school.\" Does she swim for pleasure now? \"Yes.\" Fast? \"Not fast. My body's not as hydrodynamic as it used to be because there's a lot more of it!\" She laughs.\n\nShe's still contemplating the transition she's most proud of. \"I think it's the place that I'm in right now. I'm the most consistently happy I've been in my entire life. I've got so much love in my life and things to be happy for. I never saw that I would be in this position.\" She pauses. \"I never really thought I would be alive at this point.\" Is she off medication now? \"No, I'm on a very low dose of antidepressants. Not that that matters! I never saw this part of my life. I never planned this far. Even though it was really hard year last year with losing Ava and starting the year in a really dark place, ever since those really tough moments I have fallen back in love with life.\" Finishing the book, she says, is a relief and a release. Now she doesn't have to tell anybody her story. It's there in writing, and she finally believes she knows who she is. What's more, she likes Munroe Bergdorf and is happy to hang out with her. \"I really feel this is my life now,\" she says. \"And I'm not going to allow it to be dictated to by anybody else.\"\n\nTransitional is published by Bloomsbury on 16 February.

      "text": "Chilling effect of immigration rules will blight an American generation\n\nIt is the symbolism of the Trump administration - more than the substance - that is wreaking havoc on immigrant families\n\n\"I 've been told since fifth grade that college makes you a better person,\" said the young woman. Her mother, an immigrant from Mexico, had always dreamed of going to college, but never got the chance. So, as she started her senior year at KIPP University Prep, a charter school in San Antonio, she buckled down and filled out applications to more than a dozen schools.\n\nBut then, suddenly, things went sideways. Her mother was in the process of becoming a US citizen this fall, and she was afraid that the financial aid application might derail the process. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the young woman asked me not to use her real name. I'll call her Mariela.\n\nBack in September , the Trump administration announced a long-rumored proposal to deter immigrants seeking long-term legal residency from using public health, nutrition and housing programs. The result would be that immigrants who use these programs would have a lower chance of receiving long-term legal residency in the United States. While this so-called \"public charge\" rule does not apply to federal financial aid programs, Mariela's mother still worried. Advocates for immigrant families call this \"the chilling effect\" of the administration's approach to immigration.\n\nMariela's story shows how, stunning as it sounds, the symbolism of the administration's immigration agenda may matter even more than the substance .\n\nSure, the substance of the administration's agenda is amply cruel. It has left hundreds of thousands of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) recipients uncertain about their legal status. It has ripped thousands of vulnerable children from asylum-seeking families at the border. Nearly 200,000 US-citizen children stand to lose their immigrant parents to the administration's sunsetting of their legal right to stay in the country. The public charge proposal alone would affect the long-term legal status of nearly 400,000 immigrants each year.\n\nThe underlying message - the symbolism - is clear. In each of these cases, the administration presents immigrants as dangerous. It targets them as others, as not-fully-human, as competitors that undermine the values, pocketbooks and opportunities of native-born Americans. It demeans immigrants and divides them from native-born Americans.\n\nThink about the ugly messages Donald Trump's immigration agenda reinforces for native-born Americans. It suggests that, whenever possible, immigrants should be dissuaded from coming to the United States - even if that requires threatening and/or harming children. Further, it suggests that legal immigrants working and paying taxes in the United States should be discouraged from using public programs that would help them and their families live healthier, more productive lives.\n\nIt seems almost quaint to insist on this in 2019, when the facts of so many matters have been so thoroughly damned so many times, but still: almost none of this thinking is even remotely tethered to the real world. There are reams of research showing how immigrants make communities - and the country - richer, safer and better .\n\nMariela's ears are open too. Think about how she hears these messages emboldening many native-born Americans' prejudices. In the past two years, Mariela says that she's repeatedly been abused by white strangers. They taunt her - \"you're gonna get deported\" - and that, she says, \"makes me feel like I'm illegal here\".\n\nHer mother's mistrust of an antagonistic, fickle US government could leave a citizen like Mariela without a path through college. It would scramble her precarious, carefully laid plans. She's done everything right - she's worked hard and built a foundation for her future. She wants to believe in this country, in its meritocratic promises - work hard, get a degree, do better than your parents. But, in 2019, it's not entirely clear to her that her country believes in or has a place for her.\n\nThere are millions of others like Mariela - children with at least one immigrant parent are a growing segment of the US student body today, and will be a large share of the US workforce in the future. What happens if the Trump administration's agenda blocks their ambitions and dashes their hopes? Deterring these children from college will make them less educated, and less productive, but it's hard to see how it makes the country better.\n\nThe administration's immigration agenda also divides immigrant families from native-born American families (many of whom, we should note, are just immigrant families of a marginally less recent vintage). It's undermining how these families see one another. And for what? Short-term political gains fueled by anxious American revanchism?\n\nOne of Mariela's classmates, who I will call Gustavo, ran into similar difficulties this fall. As he approached college and financial aid applications, his parents balked. \"[They] told me not to fill mine out. They were scared that something might happen to my mom,\" he said. She's in the country on a visa, and Gustavo said the family worried that applying for financial aid to support his education could cost her the right to stay with her husband and son, both of whom are native-born US citizens. Money's tight in Gustavo's family - he says he works after school to help pay the bills. He can't see a path to college without financial aid.\n\nAsked if he feels American, Gustavo hesitates, mulling his long life in the country, reflecting on his deferred dreams. Maybe someday, he says, when he and \"every Hispanic person can feel safe going out and not have any type of racial slurs\". He sighs. \"The United States is not what I'd call a free country, because we're still in the shadows, hiding.\"\n\nHis situation more or less sums up the problem with the administration's immigration agenda. Most of it is substantively ineffective, more likely to inflict cruelty on vulnerable families than to achieve any meaningful improvements to the United States. And yet, all of it further stigmatizes immigrant families, and that detaches them from the country's social life and public institutions. Through a strange and selfish alchemy, it converts basic pieces of upward mobility - access to food, healthcare and education - into supposed luxuries that immigrants and their children should not be able to access.\n\nLike Mariela, Gustavo says he's trying to believe in the rules, trying to make his family proud. \"Most Hispanic parents ... want something bigger. They always pushed me to go to college.\" Without the resources to pursue his college dream, afraid that his government would penalize or target his family if he applied for financial aid, frustrated and marginalized by his country's leadership, Gustavo needed another door to opportunity and the American Dream.\n\nSo he's trying another way of proving to his birth country that he belongs, that he should have a shot: he's offering up his body. He's joining the military.\n\nConor P Williams is a fellow at The Century Foundation"

      "text": "'I can have a voice': Latino voters set for decisive role in key Arizona county\n\nRising Latino engagement has been fueled by opposition to Maricopa county's longtime former sheriff Joe Arpaio and could help win the White House\n\nEven before she could vote, Imelda Quiroz Beltran had a goal for this election: to register as many Latino voters in Maricopa county as possible - and make sure they cast their ballots.\n\nEvery day for months, she has gone door to door with the non-profit Mi Familia Vota, undeterred by the searing desert sun - zipping across Phoenix's sprawling concrete-paved neighborhoods in search of eligible voters.\n\nAnd then the day came when Beltran registered herself - after she became a naturalized citizen this year.\n\n\"Finally, I can have a voice,\" she said. \"And this year, it is so important that we all have a voice.\"\n\nMaricopa - which includes Phoenix - is the fastest-growing county in the US. Of its nearly 4.5 million residents, one-third identify as Latino, according to census data.\n\nWhile Arizona has voted for the Republican presidential nominee in every election but one since 1952, this year, political strategists and pollsters are predicting that Latino voters in Maricopa could play a decisive role in electing Joe Biden to the White House and Democrats up and down the ballot.\n\n\"Whoever wins the Latino vote, is going to win Maricopa county. And whoever wins Maricopa county is going to win Arizona ,\" said Joseph Garcia, director of Chicanos Por La Causa Action Fund, a non-profit based in Phoenix. \"And whoever wins Arizona is likely to win the White House.\"\n\nWith early voting already well under way, Biden is leading among registered Latino voters in Arizona by a staggering 38 points.\n\nThis year, Democrats also find themselves with a real chance of taking control of the US Senate. In Arizona's Senate race, Democrat Mark Kelly - a former astronaut - is leading the incumbent Republican Martha McSally by five or six points among registered voters, and by more than 25 points among Latinos.\n\nThe forces that have made Maricopa county and Arizona such a hotly contested election battleground this year were set in motion more than a decade ago, by a generation of young, progressive Latino activists who mobilized against the hardline immigration policies and Joe Arpaio, the rightwing Maricopa county sheriff who became known as \"the Donald Trump of Arizona\".\n\nBut in the last four years, Trump's chaotic, divisive tenure has accelerated the electorate's leftward shift. And in recent months, anger over the Republican governor Doug Ducey's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately devastated the state's Latino communities, has further alienated voters from the right.\n\nThough Mi Familia Vota's canvassers help both Republicans and Democrats register to vote, Beltran says she often meets people canvassing who - like her - feel betrayed by the current administration. Trump enraged Beltran from the moment he launched his campaign in 2016, when he characterized Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. Those comments, she said, \"made me want to move and do something\".\n\nBeltran believes the president has emboldened racists. \"I've lived here 30 years,\" she said. \"I speak English.\" But in the past four years - she said she has heard more white strangers than ever before tell her to \"go back\" to where she came from.\n\nThe election in 2016, \"really, I think activated people - it was a wake-up call for many,\" said Athena Salman, who was elected to the state house the same year Trump was elected to the White House. \"But I tell people, especially those who weren't involved or civically engaged up until Trump was elected - we had our own Donald Trump,\" she said.\n\nThat would be Arpaio, the Maricopa sheriff known for his anti-immigration policies and reality-TV antics, who joined forces with Trump to investigate the racist conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the US.\n\nArpaio was buoyed by local and state officials - who in 2010 passed SB 1070, known here as the \"show me your papers\" law that allowed police to detain anyone they suspected of being in the US illegally, which activists and civil rights lawyers argued opened the door to racial profiling against Latinos and other immigrants.\n\nThe law initially energized conservatives, who rewarded hard-right populists. But it also activated a generation of young Latinos and progressives - including Salman, who was a college student at the time.\n\nThough activists ultimately failed to stop the bill from being signed into law, they were undeterred.\n\n\"We kept going, we kept pushing,\" said Carlos Garcia, a longtime activist who was elected to the Phoenix city council in 2018. \"We took to the courts, we hit the streets, we registered people to vote. We tried every tactic. We built power.\"\n\nA year later, in 2011, activists led a successful recall against the bill's author, Russell Pearce, who became the first state lawmaker in Arizona history to be removed from office by voters via a recall election. Through a series of court cases, they successfully dismantled key provisions of his signature legislation. And then in 2016 - the same day Trump claimed the presidency - Maricopa voters ousted Arpaio after nearly a quarter-century in power.\n\n\"Every election year, politicians ask - when will the Latino vote show up for us,\" said Eduardo Sainz, the Arizona state director for Mi Familia Vota. \"But the thing is, we have been showing up - we have been showing up for ourselves.\"\n\nIn 2018, young Latino voters cast ballots in record numbers, and elected Kyrsten Sinema - the first Democrat to win a US Senate seat in Arizona in decades. Since then, an estimated 100,000 more Latino voters have come of age and have become eligible to vote.\n\nMi Familia Vota is hoping to mobilize as many of these new voters as possible to cast their ballots, having registered 185,000 voters - young and old - this year.\n\n\"The electorate itself definitely looks different than 2016,\" said Josh Ulibarri, a Democratic pollster based in Phoenix.\n\n\"There are new voters in the mix,\" he said. \"And those voters tend to be a little more oriented towards Biden, towards Democrats and towards change in general.\"\n\nLatinos account for 18% of the US population, and are the country's second-largest racial or ethnic group, said Josepha Garcia of Chicanos por la Causa, though he stressed that they are \"not monolithic\".\n\nAnd yet, Latino voters - especially young, progressive Latino voters like those in Maricopa county - are poised to play a decisive role in swing states across the country, he said. An estimated 1 million Latinos will turn 18 every year for the next two decades in the US, joining a diverse new generation of voters in the US that will transform the country's political future.\n\nIt is still uncertain whether Biden and Democrats can parlay demographic change, a growing progressive movement and disdain for Trump seen in counties like Maricopa into victories in November. Though he has struggled to make gains with Latino voters, there are signs he has improved his standing: Biden is leading among likely Latino voters in Arizona 66% to 28%, according to a recent Monmouth poll. Those numbers are consistent with national trends: Biden holds a 34-point lead over Trump among Latino eligible voters across the country, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center.\n\n\" What it comes down to is the numbers - and if the numbers turn out at the ballot box,\" Garcia said.\n\nIn a high-turnout race, the Monmouth poll found Biden with a seven-point lead - but a likely voter model with lower turnout found Biden with just a two-point advantage.\n\nThough there is little chance the president will win over most Latino voters here, siphoning off even a small share of Biden's support could be consequential in a tight race.\n\nThe Trump campaign is specifically targeting Latino men who prioritize jobs and the economy - issues where the president still has an advantage. And Trump - who this week saw his conservative, anti-abortion nominee confirmed to the US supreme court - also appeals to many anti-abortion Latino voters in the area.\n\nAt a Latinos for Trump rally in Phoenix, hundreds of supporters packed into a hotel conference room to see the president, Governor Ducey and a panel of Latino business owners. \"We are Catholic, we are pro-life. For me, definitely our values of freedom, family and faith are represented in the Republican party,\" said Alma Rodriguez, 28, who came with her husband.\n\nA mother of four, Rodriguez said she was frustrated by Ducey's response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit her husband's construction business and left her children anxious as their public school struggled to adapt to online learning.\n\nThe pandemic has killed more than 225,000 Americans and infected millions, far more than any other country, with deaths and cases surging in the midwest in recent weeks. A majority of Americans do not approve of the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic, which has taken a disproportionate toll on Latinos across the nation, including in Maricopa. But Rodriguez believes Trump was right to \"leave it to the governors - he's not a dictator\".\n\nShe said the Latinos for Trump offices in south Phoenix have helped solidify her support for the president. \"It really blows my mind that the president has opened up a whole office, just for us,\" she said. \"I have not received any phone calls from Biden.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign, which initially avoided in-person events and door-to-door canvassing due to the pandemic, has resumed traditional campaigning in the final few weeks. But progressive organizers worry that these efforts are too little, too late.\n\nDemocrats have for too long maintained a transactional relationship with Latino voters, said Gilbert Romero, who was a delegate for Biden's former rival, Bernie Sanders, at the Democratic national convention earlier this year.\n\n\"Arizona could have gone blue in the year 2000. Hillary Clinton could have won in 2016,\" he said. But while voters in Maricopa have helped elect a wave of progressive Latinos to local and statewide office, the region has continued to back Republicans in national races. \"The voters have always been there - but the fact is, we haven't had a candidate that actually speaks to us,\" Romero said.\n\nFor many Latinos, Biden was not the Democrat they wanted to see at the top of the ticket. Although the former vice-president won the primary elections, many of the younger Latino voters backed Sanders.\n\n\"But Bernie Sanders ain't on the ballot,\" said Joseph Garcia of Chicanos por la Causa Action Fund. \"An unenthusiastic vote for a candidate, counts exactly the same as an enthusiastic vote for the candidate.\"\n\nStill, Garcia and activists hope that a historic turnout among Latino voters will send a clear message to both parties.\n\n\"If they're going to use us to win elections,\" he said, \"They also going to have to listen to us, our concerns.\"\n\nOn a blazing Friday afternoon in late September, Alejandro Chavez - an organizer with the United Farm Workers and the grandson of the Arizona-born labor leader Cesar Chavez - visited the Mi Familia Vota office in downtown Phoenix, where he appealed to canvassers to make themselves heard.\n\n\"Don't just ring the bell, knock - and knock a little harder,\" he told them.\n\nIf there's a fence or a locked door, he said, \"shake it - make sure there isn't a dog first, but shake it hard!\"\n\nWhy?\n\n\"Because nobody else can be trusted to do it.\""

      "text": "Salma's World\n\nNot long after the September 11 attacks, in the dusty town of Hargeisa in the highlands of northwestern Somalia, I met a young woman named Salma. At 25 she lived alone with her mother, who chewed the stimulant shrub khat all day, and together they watched the satellite television that her father's earnings as a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia had paid for. Salma was obsessed with the twin towers, for which she expressed a deeply personal love. When Rudy Giuliani and Oprah Winfrey commemorated the deaths in a ceremony at Yankee stadium, Salma watched in Hargeisa and cried. Her sympathy was composed in large measure of longing and loneliness. \"Everyone there was crying together,\" she told me, \"but I was crying alone.\"\n\nOutside her house were stone-throwing boys and the tyrannical imam of a mosque next door. Salma's gelled hair and bright skirts drew their abuse, so she stayed inside for days at a time with her lifeline, the TV screen, which brought tidings of a world that seemed far more real to her than her own. Hargeisa was bombed to rubble during Somalia's long civil war and it's now a city teeming with refugees. But the more her people suffered, the more Salma seemed to despise them. She found New York's gaping wound more grievous. Her English was littered with turns of phrase she'd culled from hip hop - \"bitch\" was a favorite word. Like a teenager, she filled her diary with lyrics from Michael Bolton songs and a description of the menstrual cycle recalled from her years in a Kenyan primary school, when she and her mother were refugees from Somalia's civil war. Nairobi had been free and exciting, but dangerous. Somalia, on the other handÐshe hated it to the point of refusing to speak her own language. \"I wish I had two Scuds,\" she said. \"I would bomb all of Somalia.\"\n\nShe was half-educated, unqualified for most work, unwilling to marry a Somali and begin having children. She felt like a prisoner in her own country, and she feared going mad. A series of Americans in Hargeisa - the most recent were Christian aid workers - had briefly entered Salma's life (she struck up conversations with white strangers on the bus) and left her with a potent sense of hope and abandonment. Not knowing what else to do, I gave Salma a hundred dollars to help pay her way back to Nairobi, a sort of halfway house en route to her ultimate desire, which was to live in Miami or Beverly Hills. \"Africa is stupid,\" she said. \"Everything is about money because no one has any. That's all they can think about.\"\n\nIn some ways, Salma is a new figure on the world scene. In an impoverished, war-wrecked country, where no one is more than a generation away from being a nomad, her reality has been formed and deformed at dizzying speed by a narrow, but intense exposure to the modern world. If she were a young Somali man, poverty and dim prospects and news from the world she couldn't reach might have driven her to take Osama bin Laden as the spokesman for all her inchoate longings and frustrations. If she'd never gone to Kenya as a war refugee, she might already be having her third or fourth child. As it is, she knows too much and has too little. Her mental life far outruns her means.\n\nThere are millions of people around the world in Salma's position - members of the vast poor majority on whom the modern world has begun to work. In reality, the problem today in those parts of the world like Somalia where food remains an issue is that food is not the only issue. Salma needs money, but she also needs a sense of how she fits into the modern world. A new kind of identity crisis holds people like her in its neurotic grip, trapped between one culture - their own - that increasingly fails them and another culture - ours - that promises much and delivers little. It's pointless to bemoan the effect of America's trash exports on ancient civilizations. For someone like Salma, who has lost a connection to the land and the clan, and who sees nothing but failure in her corner of the contemporary world, Oprah is the image of her desire.\n\nI had gone to Somalia to find young Islamic fundamentalists, to ask about the appeal of radical Islam here in the horn of Africa. They were not eager to be found, for rumors were flying that Somali Islamists would be the next targets of America's war on terrorism. Since then, Somalia has dropped off Washington's radar again. A year later, I can see that the people I was looking for were in some ways less important than the person I found. The conflict that began around the time I went to Hargeisa has given Americans a misleadingly rigid notion of the way the world is lined up: On one side, the US and the west, democratic, modern, decadent, too-powerful; on the other, fundamentalist Islam, with its apocalyptic dreams and its siren song of third world solidarity. In this scheme, hundreds of millions of people throughout much of black Africa and Latin America and the non-Muslim parts of Asia, including Salma, have largely been forgotten. And yet they are the real audience for the war - the ones whose hearts and minds belong by birth or tradition to neither side, and could be won by either.\n\nA year ago, Americans discovered that we live inside the gates of an empire with unprecedented power. The initial response to this realization was characteristically American. Even Oprah devoted a show to Islam. Sophisticated Europeans sneered, but it's just this innocence and openness that many of the world's poorer citizens value about Americans, as anyone who has traveled through Africa knows. But in the year since then, the world has become alien again. The burst of self-education and self-examination ran its course, and Americans have withdrawn into a defensive clinch. As a result - and this is true of the left in this country just as much as the right - we misunderstand what the war is about and how to judge the world's response to it.\n\nTo one group of Americans, we are engaged in nothing less than a clash of civilizations, and \"they\" are dangerous fanatics who must be disarmed and subdued. To another group, the war against terrorism should be a war against poverty and America's victimization of the world's brown and black people. Underlying both these views, however, is an inability to imagine \"them\" as individuals. Conventional thinking on both the left and the right turns a good part of the world's six billion humans into either threats or victims, an undifferentiated mass of faceless objects of history, locked in a simple, static relationship with us. Neither view tells us what to make of a person as strange and shifting and hybrid as Salma. A central question of the war is whether the modern world, with its disorienting freedoms and choices and kaleidoscopic images, will work on behalf of someone like her, giving her a new sense of identity and fulfillment, or cast her into the unwanted pile. She doesn't want to be left alone by America; she wants to be seen and heard by it.\n\nWhat will ultimately matter more than where and how we intervene militarily is whether there will be room for the restless poor in the world of satellite TV and the pursuit of happiness. This question is an economic one, but it is also more than that. Once people become aware of themselves as individuals, they won't dissolve back into the fixed identity of the mass. \"I only think about myself,\" Salma kept saying. \"I don't care about no one else.\" In America, we call this selfish individualism and rightly see it as the besetting vice of our freedom. But in Somalia, this assertion of a young woman's own desires against the severe limits all around her seemed a necessary and healthy thing.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

In 2020, though, it's true. Really. Not just because it's a chance to oust Donald Trump and undo the damage from 2016, says voting rights champion Stacey Abrams, who ran for Georgia governor in 2018. \"2020 is also a redo and a redemption of the 2010 election,\" she says fervently. 2010 was the year, Abrams explains, that Republicans, stunned by Barack Obama's election in 2008, began their comeback. They didn't ignore federal races, by any means, but they began pouring money and energy into flipping state legislative chambers, which had been dominated by Democrats for decades. They were astonishingly successful, not only in 2010 but throughout Obama's two terms, eight sorry years in which Democrats lost 942 legislative seats. In 2009, Democrats controlled 27 state legislative assemblies and Republicans 14, with eight divided. (Nebraska's unicameral legislature is nonpartisan.) By 2017, Republicans controlled 32 and Democrats 14, with three divided. (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) In those years, Democrats' fortunes eroded at other levels: The party lost the US House in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and stunningly, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 with an Electoral College win, though she captured the popular vote. Abrams and other Democrats connect many of those losses to the states Republicans won in 2010, where they gained control over redistricting. In many states they gerrymandered state and congressional districts to disadvantage Democrats and passed voting rights restrictions. Those moves made it harder for Democrats to win state and congressional races and, ultimately, the White House. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, three states that Clinton lost by a combined 77,000 votes and thus the Electoral College, saw Republicans gain state power and pass voting rights restrictions between 2010 and 2016. The good news: In 2017 the resistance to Trump ran through state legislative races as Democrats won back 14 state seats in special elections, plus an astonishing 15 in Virginia that November (11 of them going to women, including five women of color). Learning the lessons of Virginia, a broad roster of national groups, some of them institutional and some the so-called resistance pop-ups-from a renewed Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee ( DLCC ) to Indivisible , from Emily's List to Flippable , from former attorney general Eric Holder's well-funded National Democratic Redistricting Committee to scrappy Sister District -put admirable muscle into statehouse races in 2018. The result: They turned 380 seats from red to blue that November, flipping chambers in six states.

In Minnesota they grabbed the House, and in New Hampshire they turned both. They made huge strides elsewhere in eroding GOP power, switching 16 seats in North Carolina's House and Senate, ending GOP supermajorities (which gave the legislature power to override the Democratic governor's vetoes); 14 in Texas; and 19 in Pennsylvania. In 2019, Virginia Democrats finished their job, taking the House and the Senate. With a Democratic governor, the state returned to full Democratic control for the first time in over two decades. Counting those Virginia victories, Democrats have won back over 450 seats and 10 state chambers in the Trump era.

But they need to learn the lessons of why state Democrats slumped after 2008, failing to rise to the GOP challenge, and surged after 2016. Chief among them: You can't win if you don't play. Democrats in many states had long failed even to field challengers to many Republican incumbents. That's changed hugely since 2016. In this cycle, the DLCC has spent $6.2 million to recruit candidates. Democrats also need a diverse slate of challengers, especially to turn out the people least likely to vote but most likely to be Democrats: so-called low-propensity voters, mainly people of color and younger people (who obviously overlap). Then Democrats need to target those voters, as well as run on issues and urgency that match the moment. State-level Democrats are doing fairly well on all three fronts. Covid-19 and the national uprising against police violence \"have really made people understand the power of state legislators and governors,\" says Catherine Vaughan, a cofounder of Flippable (now merged with Swing Left), formed in 2016 to focus on state races. Activists are also inspired by the sheer number of candidates running-including many women of color-who lost narrowly in 2018 and are running again. \"What's great is that Democrats aren't playing defense to hold any chamber they control, and they've fielded more state candidates than Republicans have,\" says Daily Kos communications director Carolyn Fiddler, a veteran of state legislative politics. \"So far, this looks like it could be the inverse of 2010.\" On the other hand, the Covid pandemic has turned campaigning upside down, making field organizing all but impossible and fundraising tougher, too. \"We're all just figuring it out together,\" says Amanda Litman, a cofounder of Run for Something , which recruits young Democrats to compete for state and local offices. \"Anyone who tells you they know what will happen in the states this year is full of shit.\" On the ground: Volunteers with Sister District, one of several new groups focused on winning state­houses, canvassing in Virginia in 2019. (Justin Gibby) T he diverse roster of groups working in this space is spread across the country, but most share several top-priority states, where there's a good chance to flip a chamber or where the legislature plays a role in redistricting decisions. Thus the four states that are seeing the most investment are North Carolina, where there's a chance to shift the House and Senate; Arizona, where both chambers are likewise in play; and Texas and Michigan, whose Houses may be up for grabs. Fights are also underway to turn the Minnesota Senate, the Iowa and Ohio Houses, and both Pennsylvania chambers. Wisconsin and Georgia are getting attention, too. And with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief. Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 \"I'm always raising alarms that this field isn't well resourced,\" says Hausman. \"The vast majority of donors are focused on federal races. But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nNot just because it's a chance to oust Donald Trump and undo the damage from 2016, says voting rights champion Stacey Abrams, who ran for Georgia governor in 2018. \"2020 is also a redo and a redemption of the 2010 election,\" she says fervently. 2010 was the year, Abrams explains, that Republicans, stunned by Barack Obama's election in 2008, began their comeback. They didn't ignore federal races, by any means, but they began pouring money and energy into flipping state legislative chambers, which had been dominated by Democrats for decades. They were astonishingly successful, not only in 2010 but throughout Obama's two terms, eight sorry years in which Democrats lost 942 legislative seats. In 2009, Democrats controlled 27 state legislative assemblies and Republicans 14, with eight divided. (Nebraska's unicameral legislature is nonpartisan.) By 2017, Republicans controlled 32 and Democrats 14, with three divided. (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) In those years, Democrats' fortunes eroded at other levels: The party lost the US House in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and stunningly, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 with an Electoral College win, though she captured the popular vote. Abrams and other Democrats connect many of those losses to the states Republicans won in 2010, where they gained control over redistricting. In many states they gerrymandered state and congressional districts to disadvantage Democrats and passed voting rights restrictions. Those moves made it harder for Democrats to win state and congressional races and, ultimately, the White House. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, three states that Clinton lost by a combined 77,000 votes and thus the Electoral College, saw Republicans gain state power and pass voting rights restrictions between 2010 and 2016. The good news: In 2017 the resistance to Trump ran through state legislative races as Democrats won back 14 state seats in special elections, plus an astonishing 15 in Virginia that November (11 of them going to women, including five women of color). Learning the lessons of Virginia, a broad roster of national groups, some of them institutional and some the so-called resistance pop-ups-from a renewed Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee ( DLCC ) to Indivisible , from Emily's List to Flippable , from former attorney general Eric Holder's well-funded National Democratic Redistricting Committee to scrappy Sister District -put admirable muscle into statehouse races in 2018. The result: They turned 380 seats from red to blue that November, flipping chambers in six states.

In Minnesota they grabbed the House, and in New Hampshire they turned both. They made huge strides elsewhere in eroding GOP power, switching 16 seats in North Carolina's House and Senate, ending GOP supermajorities (which gave the legislature power to override the Democratic governor's vetoes); 14 in Texas; and 19 in Pennsylvania. In 2019, Virginia Democrats finished their job, taking the House and the Senate. With a Democratic governor, the state returned to full Democratic control for the first time in over two decades. Counting those Virginia victories, Democrats have won back over 450 seats and 10 state chambers in the Trump era. Current Issue View our current issue Now those groups and some new ones are trying to change more chambers to blue, especially in states where the legislature controls redistricting. But they need to learn the lessons of why state Democrats slumped after 2008, failing to rise to the GOP challenge, and surged after 2016. Chief among them: You can't win if you don't play. Democrats in many states had long failed even to field challengers to many Republican incumbents. That's changed hugely since 2016. In this cycle, the DLCC has spent $6.2 million to recruit candidates. Democrats also need a diverse slate of challengers, especially to turn out the people least likely to vote but most likely to be Democrats: so-called low-propensity voters, mainly people of color and younger people (who obviously overlap). Then Democrats need to target those voters, as well as run on issues and urgency that match the moment. State-level Democrats are doing fairly well on all three fronts. Covid-19 and the national uprising against police violence \"have really made people understand the power of state legislators and governors,\" says Catherine Vaughan, a cofounder of Flippable (now merged with Swing Left), formed in 2016 to focus on state races. Activists are also inspired by the sheer number of candidates running-including many women of color-who lost narrowly in 2018 and are running again. \"What's great is that Democrats aren't playing defense to hold any chamber they control, and they've fielded more state candidates than Republicans have,\" says Daily Kos communications director Carolyn Fiddler, a veteran of state legislative politics. \"So far, this looks like it could be the inverse of 2010.\" On the other hand, the Covid pandemic has turned campaigning upside down, making field organizing all but impossible and fundraising tougher, too. \"We're all just figuring it out together,\" says Amanda Litman, a cofounder of Run for Something , which recruits young Democrats to compete for state and local offices. \"Anyone who tells you they know what will happen in the states this year is full of shit.\" On the ground: Volunteers with Sister District, one of several new groups focused on winning state­houses, canvassing in Virginia in 2019. (Justin Gibby) T he diverse roster of groups working in this space is spread across the country, but most share several top-priority states, where there's a good chance to flip a chamber or where the legislature plays a role in redistricting decisions. Thus the four states that are seeing the most investment are North Carolina, where there's a chance to shift the House and Senate; Arizona, where both chambers are likewise in play; and Texas and Michigan, whose Houses may be up for grabs. Fights are also underway to turn the Minnesota Senate, the Iowa and Ohio Houses, and both Pennsylvania chambers. Wisconsin and Georgia are getting attention, too. And with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief. Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 \"I'm always raising alarms that this field isn't well resourced,\" says Hausman. \"The vast majority of donors are focused on federal races. But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\n2010 was the year, Abrams explains, that Republicans, stunned by Barack Obama's election in 2008, began their comeback. They didn't ignore federal races, by any means, but they began pouring money and energy into flipping state legislative chambers, which had been dominated by Democrats for decades. They were astonishingly successful, not only in 2010 but throughout Obama's two terms, eight sorry years in which Democrats lost 942 legislative seats. In 2009, Democrats controlled 27 state legislative assemblies and Republicans 14, with eight divided. (Nebraska's unicameral legislature is nonpartisan.) By 2017, Republicans controlled 32 and Democrats 14, with three divided. (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) In those years, Democrats' fortunes eroded at other levels: The party lost the US House in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and stunningly, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 with an Electoral College win, though she captured the popular vote. Abrams and other Democrats connect many of those losses to the states Republicans won in 2010, where they gained control over redistricting. In many states they gerrymandered state and congressional districts to disadvantage Democrats and passed voting rights restrictions. Those moves made it harder for Democrats to win state and congressional races and, ultimately, the White House. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, three states that Clinton lost by a combined 77,000 votes and thus the Electoral College, saw Republicans gain state power and pass voting rights restrictions between 2010 and 2016. The good news: In 2017 the resistance to Trump ran through state legislative races as Democrats won back 14 state seats in special elections, plus an astonishing 15 in Virginia that November (11 of them going to women, including five women of color). Learning the lessons of Virginia, a broad roster of national groups, some of them institutional and some the so-called resistance pop-ups-from a renewed Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee ( DLCC ) to Indivisible , from Emily's List to Flippable , from former attorney general Eric Holder's well-funded National Democratic Redistricting Committee to scrappy Sister District -put admirable muscle into statehouse races in 2018. The result: They turned 380 seats from red to blue that November, flipping chambers in six states.

In Minnesota they grabbed the House, and in New Hampshire they turned both. They made huge strides elsewhere in eroding GOP power, switching 16 seats in North Carolina's House and Senate, ending GOP supermajorities (which gave the legislature power to override the Democratic governor's vetoes); 14 in Texas; and 19 in Pennsylvania. In 2019, Virginia Democrats finished their job, taking the House and the Senate. With a Democratic governor, the state returned to full Democratic control for the first time in over two decades. Counting those Virginia victories, Democrats have won back over 450 seats and 10 state chambers in the Trump era. Current Issue View our current issue Now those groups and some new ones are trying to change more chambers to blue, especially in states where the legislature controls redistricting. But they need to learn the lessons of why state Democrats slumped after 2008, failing to rise to the GOP challenge, and surged after 2016. Chief among them: You can't win if you don't play. Democrats in many states had long failed even to field challengers to many Republican incumbents. That's changed hugely since 2016. In this cycle, the DLCC has spent $6.2 million to recruit candidates. Democrats also need a diverse slate of challengers, especially to turn out the people least likely to vote but most likely to be Democrats: so-called low-propensity voters, mainly people of color and younger people (who obviously overlap). Then Democrats need to target those voters, as well as run on issues and urgency that match the moment. State-level Democrats are doing fairly well on all three fronts. Covid-19 and the national uprising against police violence \"have really made people understand the power of state legislators and governors,\" says Catherine Vaughan, a cofounder of Flippable (now merged with Swing Left), formed in 2016 to focus on state races. Activists are also inspired by the sheer number of candidates running-including many women of color-who lost narrowly in 2018 and are running again. \"What's great is that Democrats aren't playing defense to hold any chamber they control, and they've fielded more state candidates than Republicans have,\" says Daily Kos communications director Carolyn Fiddler, a veteran of state legislative politics. \"So far, this looks like it could be the inverse of 2010.\" On the other hand, the Covid pandemic has turned campaigning upside down, making field organizing all but impossible and fundraising tougher, too. \"We're all just figuring it out together,\" says Amanda Litman, a cofounder of Run for Something , which recruits young Democrats to compete for state and local offices. \"Anyone who tells you they know what will happen in the states this year is full of shit.\" On the ground: Volunteers with Sister District, one of several new groups focused on winning state­houses, canvassing in Virginia in 2019. (Justin Gibby) T he diverse roster of groups working in this space is spread across the country, but most share several top-priority states, where there's a good chance to flip a chamber or where the legislature plays a role in redistricting decisions. Thus the four states that are seeing the most investment are North Carolina, where there's a chance to shift the House and Senate; Arizona, where both chambers are likewise in play; and Texas and Michigan, whose Houses may be up for grabs. Fights are also underway to turn the Minnesota Senate, the Iowa and Ohio Houses, and both Pennsylvania chambers. Wisconsin and Georgia are getting attention, too. And with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief. Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 \"I'm always raising alarms that this field isn't well resourced,\" says Hausman. \"The vast majority of donors are focused on federal races. But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\n(Source: National Conference of State Legislatures)\n\nIn those years, Democrats' fortunes eroded at other levels: The party lost the US House in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and stunningly, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 with an Electoral College win, though she captured the popular vote. Abrams and other Democrats connect many of those losses to the states Republicans won in 2010, where they gained control over redistricting. In many states they gerrymandered state and congressional districts to disadvantage Democrats and passed voting rights restrictions. Those moves made it harder for Democrats to win state and congressional races and, ultimately, the White House. Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, three states that Clinton lost by a combined 77,000 votes and thus the Electoral College, saw Republicans gain state power and pass voting rights restrictions between 2010 and 2016. The good news: In 2017 the resistance to Trump ran through state legislative races as Democrats won back 14 state seats in special elections, plus an astonishing 15 in Virginia that November (11 of them going to women, including five women of color). Learning the lessons of Virginia, a broad roster of national groups, some of them institutional and some the so-called resistance pop-ups-from a renewed Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee ( DLCC ) to Indivisible , from Emily's List to Flippable , from former attorney general Eric Holder's well-funded National Democratic Redistricting Committee to scrappy Sister District -put admirable muscle into statehouse races in 2018. The result: They turned 380 seats from red to blue that November, flipping chambers in six states.

In Minnesota they grabbed the House, and in New Hampshire they turned both. They made huge strides elsewhere in eroding GOP power, switching 16 seats in North Carolina's House and Senate, ending GOP supermajorities (which gave the legislature power to override the Democratic governor's vetoes); 14 in Texas; and 19 in Pennsylvania. In 2019, Virginia Democrats finished their job, taking the House and the Senate. With a Democratic governor, the state returned to full Democratic control for the first time in over two decades. Counting those Virginia victories, Democrats have won back over 450 seats and 10 state chambers in the Trump era. Current Issue View our current issue Now those groups and some new ones are trying to change more chambers to blue, especially in states where the legislature controls redistricting. But they need to learn the lessons of why state Democrats slumped after 2008, failing to rise to the GOP challenge, and surged after 2016. Chief among them: You can't win if you don't play. Democrats in many states had long failed even to field challengers to many Republican incumbents. That's changed hugely since 2016. In this cycle, the DLCC has spent $6.2 million to recruit candidates. Democrats also need a diverse slate of challengers, especially to turn out the people least likely to vote but most likely to be Democrats: so-called low-propensity voters, mainly people of color and younger people (who obviously overlap). Then Democrats need to target those voters, as well as run on issues and urgency that match the moment. State-level Democrats are doing fairly well on all three fronts. Covid-19 and the national uprising against police violence \"have really made people understand the power of state legislators and governors,\" says Catherine Vaughan, a cofounder of Flippable (now merged with Swing Left), formed in 2016 to focus on state races. Activists are also inspired by the sheer number of candidates running-including many women of color-who lost narrowly in 2018 and are running again. \"What's great is that Democrats aren't playing defense to hold any chamber they control, and they've fielded more state candidates than Republicans have,\" says Daily Kos communications director Carolyn Fiddler, a veteran of state legislative politics. \"So far, this looks like it could be the inverse of 2010.\" On the other hand, the Covid pandemic has turned campaigning upside down, making field organizing all but impossible and fundraising tougher, too. \"We're all just figuring it out together,\" says Amanda Litman, a cofounder of Run for Something , which recruits young Democrats to compete for state and local offices. \"Anyone who tells you they know what will happen in the states this year is full of shit.\" On the ground: Volunteers with Sister District, one of several new groups focused on winning state­houses, canvassing in Virginia in 2019. (Justin Gibby) T he diverse roster of groups working in this space is spread across the country, but most share several top-priority states, where there's a good chance to flip a chamber or where the legislature plays a role in redistricting decisions. Thus the four states that are seeing the most investment are North Carolina, where there's a chance to shift the House and Senate; Arizona, where both chambers are likewise in play; and Texas and Michigan, whose Houses may be up for grabs. Fights are also underway to turn the Minnesota Senate, the Iowa and Ohio Houses, and both Pennsylvania chambers. Wisconsin and Georgia are getting attention, too. And with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief. Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name.

(A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nThe good news: In 2017 the resistance to Trump ran through state legislative races as Democrats won back 14 state seats in special elections, plus an astonishing 15 in Virginia that November (11 of them going to women, including five women of color). Learning the lessons of Virginia, a broad roster of national groups, some of them institutional and some the so-called resistance pop-ups-from a renewed Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee ( DLCC ) to Indivisible , from Emily's List to Flippable , from former attorney general Eric Holder's well-funded National Democratic Redistricting Committee to scrappy Sister District -put admirable muscle into statehouse races in 2018. The result: They turned 380 seats from red to blue that November, flipping chambers in six states.

In Minnesota they grabbed the House, and in New Hampshire they turned both. They made huge strides elsewhere in eroding GOP power, switching 16 seats in North Carolina's House and Senate, ending GOP supermajorities (which gave the legislature power to override the Democratic governor's vetoes); 14 in Texas; and 19 in Pennsylvania. In 2019, Virginia Democrats finished their job, taking the House and the Senate. With a Democratic governor, the state returned to full Democratic control for the first time in over two decades. Counting those Virginia victories, Democrats have won back over 450 seats and 10 state chambers in the Trump era. Current Issue View our current issue Now those groups and some new ones are trying to change more chambers to blue, especially in states where the legislature controls redistricting. But they need to learn the lessons of why state Democrats slumped after 2008, failing to rise to the GOP challenge, and surged after 2016. Chief among them: You can't win if you don't play. Democrats in many states had long failed even to field challengers to many Republican incumbents. That's changed hugely since 2016. In this cycle, the DLCC has spent $6.2 million to recruit candidates. Democrats also need a diverse slate of challengers, especially to turn out the people least likely to vote but most likely to be Democrats: so-called low-propensity voters, mainly people of color and younger people (who obviously overlap). Then Democrats need to target those voters, as well as run on issues and urgency that match the moment. State-level Democrats are doing fairly well on all three fronts. Covid-19 and the national uprising against police violence \"have really made people understand the power of state legislators and governors,\" says Catherine Vaughan, a cofounder of Flippable (now merged with Swing Left), formed in 2016 to focus on state races. Activists are also inspired by the sheer number of candidates running-including many women of color-who lost narrowly in 2018 and are running again. \"What's great is that Democrats aren't playing defense to hold any chamber they control, and they've fielded more state candidates than Republicans have,\" says Daily Kos communications director Carolyn Fiddler, a veteran of state legislative politics. \"So far, this looks like it could be the inverse of 2010.\" On the other hand, the Covid pandemic has turned campaigning upside down, making field organizing all but impossible and fundraising tougher, too. \"We're all just figuring it out together,\" says Amanda Litman, a cofounder of Run for Something , which recruits young Democrats to compete for state and local offices. \"Anyone who tells you they know what will happen in the states this year is full of shit.\" On the ground: Volunteers with Sister District, one of several new groups focused on winning state­houses, canvassing in Virginia in 2019. (Justin Gibby) T he diverse roster of groups working in this space is spread across the country, but most share several top-priority states, where there's a good chance to flip a chamber or where the legislature plays a role in redistricting decisions. Thus the four states that are seeing the most investment are North Carolina, where there's a chance to shift the House and Senate; Arizona, where both chambers are likewise in play; and Texas and Michigan, whose Houses may be up for grabs. Fights are also underway to turn the Minnesota Senate, the Iowa and Ohio Houses, and both Pennsylvania chambers. Wisconsin and Georgia are getting attention, too. And with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief. Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time.

The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable.

In Minnesota they grabbed the House, and in New Hampshire they turned both. They made huge strides elsewhere in eroding GOP power, switching 16 seats in North Carolina's House and Senate, ending GOP supermajorities (which gave the legislature power to override the Democratic governor's vetoes); 14 in Texas; and 19 in Pennsylvania. In 2019, Virginia Democrats finished their job, taking the House and the Senate. With a Democratic governor, the state returned to full Democratic control for the first time in over two decades. Counting those Virginia victories, Democrats have won back over 450 seats and 10 state chambers in the Trump era. Current Issue View our current issue Now those groups and some new ones are trying to change more chambers to blue, especially in states where the legislature controls redistricting. But they need to learn the lessons of why state Democrats slumped after 2008, failing to rise to the GOP challenge, and surged after 2016. Chief among them: You can't win if you don't play. Democrats in many states had long failed even to field challengers to many Republican incumbents. That's changed hugely since 2016. In this cycle, the DLCC has spent $6.2 million to recruit candidates. Democrats also need a diverse slate of challengers, especially to turn out the people least likely to vote but most likely to be Democrats: so-called low-propensity voters, mainly people of color and younger people (who obviously overlap). Then Democrats need to target those voters, as well as run on issues and urgency that match the moment. State-level Democrats are doing fairly well on all three fronts. Covid-19 and the national uprising against police violence \"have really made people understand the power of state legislators and governors,\" says Catherine Vaughan, a cofounder of Flippable (now merged with Swing Left), formed in 2016 to focus on state races. Activists are also inspired by the sheer number of candidates running-including many women of color-who lost narrowly in 2018 and are running again. \"What's great is that Democrats aren't playing defense to hold any chamber they control, and they've fielded more state candidates than Republicans have,\" says Daily Kos communications director Carolyn Fiddler, a veteran of state legislative politics. \"So far, this looks like it could be the inverse of 2010.\" On the other hand, the Covid pandemic has turned campaigning upside down, making field organizing all but impossible and fundraising tougher, too. \"We're all just figuring it out together,\" says Amanda Litman, a cofounder of Run for Something , which recruits young Democrats to compete for state and local offices. \"Anyone who tells you they know what will happen in the states this year is full of shit.\" On the ground: Volunteers with Sister District, one of several new groups focused on winning state­houses, canvassing in Virginia in 2019. (Justin Gibby) T he diverse roster of groups working in this space is spread across the country, but most share several top-priority states, where there's a good chance to flip a chamber or where the legislature plays a role in redistricting decisions. Thus the four states that are seeing the most investment are North Carolina, where there's a chance to shift the House and Senate; Arizona, where both chambers are likewise in play; and Texas and Michigan, whose Houses may be up for grabs. Fights are also underway to turn the Minnesota Senate, the Iowa and Ohio Houses, and both Pennsylvania chambers. Wisconsin and Georgia are getting attention, too. And with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief. Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand.

Then Democrats need to target those voters, as well as run on issues and urgency that match the moment. State-level Democrats are doing fairly well on all three fronts. Covid-19 and the national uprising against police violence \"have really made people understand the power of state legislators and governors,\" says Catherine Vaughan, a cofounder of Flippable (now merged with Swing Left), formed in 2016 to focus on state races.

And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 \"I'm always raising alarms that this field isn't well resourced,\" says Hausman. \"The vast majority of donors are focused on federal races. But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nNow those groups and some new ones are trying to change more chambers to blue, especially in states where the legislature controls redistricting. But they need to learn the lessons of why state Democrats slumped after 2008, failing to rise to the GOP challenge, and surged after 2016. Chief among them: You can't win if you don't play. Democrats in many states had long failed even to field challengers to many Republican incumbents. That's changed hugely since 2016. In this cycle, the DLCC has spent $6.2 million to recruit candidates. Democrats also need a diverse slate of challengers, especially to turn out the people least likely to vote but most likely to be Democrats: so-called low-propensity voters, mainly people of color and younger people (who obviously overlap).

Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says.

I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 \"I'm always raising alarms that this field isn't well resourced,\" says Hausman. \"The vast majority of donors are focused on federal races. But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nChief among them: You can't win if you don't play. Democrats in many states had long failed even to field challengers to many Republican incumbents. That's changed hugely since 2016. In this cycle, the DLCC has spent $6.2 million to recruit candidates. Democrats also need a diverse slate of challengers, especially to turn out the people least likely to vote but most likely to be Democrats: so-called low-propensity voters, mainly people of color and younger people (who obviously overlap). Then Democrats need to target those voters, as well as run on issues and urgency that match the moment. State-level Democrats are doing fairly well on all three fronts. Covid-19 and the national uprising against police violence \"have really made people understand the power of state legislators and governors,\" says Catherine Vaughan, a cofounder of Flippable (now merged with Swing Left), formed in 2016 to focus on state races. Activists are also inspired by the sheer number of candidates running-including many women of color-who lost narrowly in 2018 and are running again. \"What's great is that Democrats aren't playing defense to hold any chamber they control, and they've fielded more state candidates than Republicans have,\" says Daily Kos communications director Carolyn Fiddler, a veteran of state legislative politics. \"So far, this looks like it could be the inverse of 2010.\" On the other hand, the Covid pandemic has turned campaigning upside down, making field organizing all but impossible and fundraising tougher, too. \"We're all just figuring it out together,\" says Amanda Litman, a cofounder of Run for Something , which recruits young Democrats to compete for state and local offices. \"Anyone who tells you they know what will happen in the states this year is full of shit.\" On the ground: Volunteers with Sister District, one of several new groups focused on winning state­houses, canvassing in Virginia in 2019. (Justin Gibby) T he diverse roster of groups working in this space is spread across the country, but most share several top-priority states, where there's a good chance to flip a chamber or where the legislature plays a role in redistricting decisions. Thus the four states that are seeing the most investment are North Carolina, where there's a chance to shift the House and Senate; Arizona, where both chambers are likewise in play; and Texas and Michigan, whose Houses may be up for grabs. Fights are also underway to turn the Minnesota Senate, the Iowa and Ohio Houses, and both Pennsylvania chambers. Wisconsin and Georgia are getting attention, too. And with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief. Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name.

If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nState-level Democrats are doing fairly well on all three fronts. Covid-19 and the national uprising against police violence \"have really made people understand the power of state legislators and governors,\" says Catherine Vaughan, a cofounder of Flippable (now merged with Swing Left), formed in 2016 to focus on state races. Activists are also inspired by the sheer number of candidates running-including many women of color-who lost narrowly in 2018 and are running again. \"What's great is that Democrats aren't playing defense to hold any chamber they control, and they've fielded more state candidates than Republicans have,\" says Daily Kos communications director Carolyn Fiddler, a veteran of state legislative politics. \"So far, this looks like it could be the inverse of 2010.\" On the other hand, the Covid pandemic has turned campaigning upside down, making field organizing all but impossible and fundraising tougher, too. \"We're all just figuring it out together,\" says Amanda Litman, a cofounder of Run for Something , which recruits young Democrats to compete for state and local offices. \"Anyone who tells you they know what will happen in the states this year is full of shit.\" On the ground: Volunteers with Sister District, one of several new groups focused on winning state­houses, canvassing in Virginia in 2019. (Justin Gibby) T he diverse roster of groups working in this space is spread across the country, but most share several top-priority states, where there's a good chance to flip a chamber or where the legislature plays a role in redistricting decisions. Thus the four states that are seeing the most investment are North Carolina, where there's a chance to shift the House and Senate; Arizona, where both chambers are likewise in play; and Texas and Michigan, whose Houses may be up for grabs. Fights are also underway to turn the Minnesota Senate, the Iowa and Ohio Houses, and both Pennsylvania chambers. Wisconsin and Georgia are getting attention, too. And with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief. Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage.

Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nOn the ground: Volunteers with Sister District, one of several new groups focused on winning state­houses, canvassing in Virginia in 2019. (Justin Gibby)\n\nT he diverse roster of groups working in this space is spread across the country, but most share several top-priority states, where there's a good chance to flip a chamber or where the legislature plays a role in redistricting decisions. Thus the four states that are seeing the most investment are North Carolina, where there's a chance to shift the House and Senate; Arizona, where both chambers are likewise in play; and Texas and Michigan, whose Houses may be up for grabs. Fights are also underway to turn the Minnesota Senate, the Iowa and Ohio Houses, and both Pennsylvania chambers. Wisconsin and Georgia are getting attention, too. And with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief.

And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nAnd with a late, unexpected surge of first-time candidates, Florida has emerged as a fascinating laboratory for building Democratic infrastructure on the ground. Republicans hold a trifecta in state power-hapless Governor Ron DeSantis as well as both legislative houses-and they have botched the pandemic response beyond belief. Groups like Sister District, Forward Majority, and the DLCC are starting to spend money there to at least build a working Democratic Party in red areas, if not flip a chamber. \"Running up the margins\" in blue districts and preventing Republicans from doing so in red districts \"can help Joe Biden win the state,\" says Fergie Reid Jr. of 90 for 90 , a group formed to honor his father, Fergie Reid Sr., who was elected in 1967 as Virginia's first Black state legislator since Reconstruction, on his 90th birthday. (He's now 95 and going strong.) It is one of the groups behind Virginia's turnaround, by registering voters and recruiting Democratic challengers. Now it has helped inspire the late surge of Florida Democratic candidates. For a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents.

Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nFor a lot of groups, North Carolina is the big prize. \"This is a microcosm of Trumpism. It all started in North Carolina,\" says Christine Bachman of Our States Matter , who is widely credited with focusing national activism on Virginia in 2017 and is mainly working with the Tarheel State this year. In 2010 wealthy right-wing North Carolina businessman Art Pope helped bankroll an assault on state Democrats, working with Republican strategist Karl Rove and the notorious GOP Redistricting Majority Project, along with Charles and David Koch. The team won Republican control of both chambers of the state's General Assembly for the first time since 1870. \"North Carolina was the original red state laboratory, where they created all their extremist legislation and then spread it everywhere,\" Bachman laments. Jessica Post, who now heads the DLCC, was a junior staffer with the organization in 2010. She saw what went down in North Carolina and elsewhere around the country that November. \"In 2010 the [Democrats'] focus was on maintaining control of Congress. The feeling was that top-of-the-ticket turnout would trickle down,\" she says. The opposite happened. \"Karl Rove did this in plain sight.\" Indeed, in March 2010 he announced in The Wall Street Journal , \"Republican strategists are focused on 107 seats in 16 states. Winning these seats would give them control of drawing district lines for nearly 190 congressional seats.\" Post says, \"We lost 21 chambers across the country that night. I remember crying on the sidewalk, saying I never want to feel this way again.\" The Fight for Statehouses Democrats Are Finally Fighting for the States-and on Election Night, They Won Big Joan Walsh The Democratic Wins in Virginia Are What Happens When You Have a Smart Ground Game-and Fair Elections Joan Walsh The 7,383-Seat Strategy Joan Walsh But North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes.

K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 \"I'm always raising alarms that this field isn't well resourced,\" says Hausman. \"The vast majority of donors are focused on federal races. But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nJoan Walsh\n\nJoan Walsh\n\nJoan Walsh\n\nBut North Carolina's Democratic Party leaders turned the tables in 2018, and Post and others say the state party has continued its rise this cycle, again recruiting candidates to run in every district, plus doubling fundraising since 2018, which was a good year. And several candidates who lost that year are stepping up to run again. Educator Aimy Steele of Cabarrus County, just northeast of Charlotte, is one of them. An African American former principal who is married to a local pastor, she was driven to run in 2018 after the state legislature tried to lower class sizes from kindergarten to third grade not by increasing funding but by increasing class sizes in higher grades. She made a determined but underfunded challenge that year and came within 2,000 votes of winning. \"I was devastated the night I lost, but the next day I said, 'I'm not finished,'\" she recalls. Aimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina. She learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time.

[William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 \"I'm always raising alarms that this field isn't well resourced,\" says Hausman. \"The vast majority of donors are focused on federal races. But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nAimy Steele hopes to be part of a blue wave in North Carolina.\n\nShe learned a lot from that first race-including that experts tend to want candidates to focus on people who vote routinely, even to try persuading wobbly Republicans, but to ignore low-propensity voters, who tend to be people of color. Steele defied them, targeting those voters and turning out thousands of them. This time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives.

But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nThis time around, she has 12 new precincts, thanks to new and fairer North Carolina maps, which give her district more voters of color. That's also more voters to introduce herself to, but she says, \"I was principal of two schools in those precincts. People know me.\" Being an educator is key to her appeal during a pandemic in which elected officials, teachers, and parents are uncertain and sometimes divided over opening schools. Steele understands the tension. \"As if teachers already didn't have an enormous amount of responsibilities that they're not compensated for. Now they need to be qualified to take temperatures, to ensure that kids are safely socially distancing themselves and also provide avenues to make sure all the kids who stay home are learning, in addition to the kids who are at school,\" she says. Parents are worried, too. But she has found constituents turning to her in the crisis-parents asking for help finding tutors, teachers asking questions about their safety. She has a spreadsheet matching teachers who want work, often extra work, with parents losing patience with their unexpected homeschooling adventures. She makes these family-teacher connections almost every day. Run for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately.

White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nRun for Something's Litman sees a version of that all over the country. \"Candidates are acting as advocates for voters during [the pandemic]. They're doing wellness checks. They're connecting,\" she says. The other thing Steele learned was the importance of advocating for herself and raising money. Even in 2018, when the North Carolina House Democratic caucus was comparatively aggressive about challenging Republicans, her district was written off as hopeless, yet she got 47 percent of the vote. She says, \"As soon as I decided to run again, I connected with the caucus, and I let them know, 'Listen, I take this very seriously. If you're willing to make an investment in me, I'm willing to run hard and run strong.' And they said, 'It looks like the race is going to be better this cycle. So we will go ahead.'\" Bachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need.

If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 \"I'm always raising alarms that this field isn't well resourced,\" says Hausman. \"The vast majority of donors are focused on federal races. But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nBachman is optimistic. \"What we know as the resistance today started out as Rev. [William] Barber II and Moral Mondays in North Carolina in 2011,\" she says. \"That was the blueprint.\" After the state's GOP leadership began passing a barrage of right-wing legislation, including strict new voter ID measures, Barber and other religious and progressive leaders began weekly protests in Raleigh and partnered on voter registration drives. The activism culminated in Barber's nationwide Poor People's Campaign this year. This time around, Steele is unapologetic about targeting Black voters in a district that's 23 percent African American. \"I told my team, we need to talk to all Black voters in the district. Because they need the person who is running for a position of power, who could possibly represent them, to look like them,\" she says. Talk of low-propensity voters frustrates her. \"I could be one of those voters. I could fall into the low-propensity category, had someone not convinced me of how important voting was.\" On this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents.

If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely. April 24, 2025 Chris Van Hollen Shows Us One Person Can Make a Difference April 21, 2025 Trump Could Bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia Home if He Wanted To April 16, 2025 \"I'm always raising alarms that this field isn't well resourced,\" says Hausman. \"The vast majority of donors are focused on federal races. But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nOn this score, Steele says, the pandemic hampers her a little. (A lot of other second-time candidates of color say the same thing.) \"Door knocking is my superpower!\" she says. Bachman notes that \"the resistance was really built on human contact-field organizing, reaching voters in person, knocking on doors-which makes this cycle all the more challenging, given that Covid has stripped our candidates of those tools.\" (Canvassing with volunteers also costs less than paid media campaign features.) \"It's just very sad,\" Steele admits. \"Last time, people told me, 'Nobody ever knocks on our door.' I'd say, 'Hey, I will!' We just had so much fun on the doors. It's cramping my style.\" On the other hand, unlike many other states with Republican-controlled legislatures, North Carolina has a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, who gets high marks for his handling of the pandemic. He is also on the ballot in November, which should boost Steele. \"Our governor is favored highly with his handling of the coronavirus, so knowing I'm in his party, that's a help.\" So much so that her opponent, Kristin Baker, has boasted about working with Cooper while downplaying the \"R\" next to her name. New leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank) T hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad.

Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nNew leaders: A Sister District captain summit in Oakland, Calif.,  in 2018.. (Sarah Blank)\n\nT hat's not the case in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott is increasingly reviled for his pandemic management -which is partly why Democrats are increasingly optimistic about their chances to win the nine seats they need to turn the state House. There are nine House districts held by Republicans that were won in 2018 by Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose run is widely credited with reviving the state's withered Democratic infrastructure. He lost to Senator Ted Cruz narrowly, but Democrats picked up an astonishing 12 seats in the House that year. Run by a bumbling GOP trifecta in the age of coronavirus, ruby-red Texas is unpredictable this year. Biden even leads Trump in a few polls there. \"Governor Abbott has taken all the ownership of Covid and has refused to believe science,\" says second-time Texas House candidate Joanna Cattanach . \"We have refrigerator trucks outside hospitals in Dallas County now.\" The net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough.

Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nThe net approval rating for Abbott's response to Covid has slipped 21 points since June, when 56 percent of Texans approved and only 36 percent disapproved; he is now underwater, with 47 percent approval, 48 percent disapproval. \"He's really made himself the face of the pandemic,\" Cattanach says, sounding bewildered. Not only did Abbott open businesses too soon, the  public health data shows, but he also discouraged face masks and social distancing and even blocked localities from imposing stricter requirements. Like Steele, Cattanach, a journalist turned community college instructor, thinks being an educator particularly helps in this race. \"Abbott put together a task force on reopening the schools with no teachers on it,\" she notes. She says people are asking \"if there will be grief counselors when we open up the schools, because people will die. I'm hearing about teachers rushing to make wills.\" Not done yet: In 2018, it was widely assumed that Joanna Cattenach had no chance of winning a seat in the Texas House. She came within 220 votes, and she's running again. Also like Steele, Cattanach was given no chance of winning her race two years ago, but she came even closer, within 220 votes. This time around, she's getting more local and even national support. She's backed by Sister District, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, and major labor unions. She says, \"My message is, 'Trust me to take care of your kids. Let me clean up this mess in Austin.' And that's resonating.\" Like so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts.

Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nLike so many women who have run for office in the Trump era, Cattanach, who is Latina, says she returned from the first Women's March \"and just felt like I'd yelled and screamed but I had to do more.\" In 2017 she saw that the Texas House was considering a \"religious liberty\" bill that, among other things, would let state-funded foster care and adoption agencies, largely controlled by Christian charities, discriminate on religious grounds-potentially locking out non-Christians, people in interfaith marriages, or LGBTQ parents. A former foster child, she pitched local writers, \"Do you want to get the perspective of a foster care child on this one?\" It was a winning angle and helped launch her campaign. (A version of the bill eventually passed.) If elected, she would be the first former foster care child in the Texas legislature. This year, some hope that a presidential election, which always gets more voters to the polls, could help boost Texas turnout-but maybe not at the state legislative level. \"We have to avoid down-ballot drop-off,\" Cattanach says. That's always a challenge in state legislative races, even in the hyperenergized Trump era.  \"In 2018 our candidates underperformed Democrats in the same congressional district by about 4 points,\" Forward Majority cofounder Vicky Hausman warns. \"It's a real problem.\" \"This is where having an obnoxiously unique name could help me,\" Cattanach jokes. Like Steele, she believes her race will come down to mobilizing those less likely to vote, not persuading those on the fence. \"We're encouraged by the digital market and reaching young people that way. I'm seen as a progressive new voice. The line used to be that I'm too liberal for this district. Not anymore.\" Kathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time. K athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced. If Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman.

After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years. There have always been stalwart Democratic activists in the reddest places, but a lot of state parties have let the infrastructure \"wither away,\" Goldstein says. Lewis eventually got access to VAN. There are gaps in its data, but this time around, she's more confident anyway. \"You know what? With the coronavirus, we have local people who don't have health care. They can't access unemployment insurance. They know Florida is a mess,\" she says. She adds that after hearing her story in 2018 about fighting with the state to get services for her daughter and hearing it again in 2020, people tell her, \"Kathy, I didn't understand last time, but now I see exactly what you were saying.\" Unfortunately, local party leaders still don't seem to understand. Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

But the Koch brothers' infrastructure is still there. The dark money is still there.\" The Republican State Leadership Committee crushed Democrats in 2010; since then, the DLCC has held its own, occasionally beating its GOP rival in fundraising. The RSLC's rhetoric is silly: Its Right Lines 2020 campaign exhorts, \"Socialism starts in the states. Let's stop it there, too.\" Though, by all accounts, Republicans have failed to recruit competitive up-and-comers and savvy challengers, they still have access to dark money, as The Guardian reported in June. This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nKathy Lewis: She is running for Florida state legislature for a second time.\n\nK athy Lewis, who's running a second time for Florida's Senate District 20, encompassing the Tampa-St. Petersburg area anchored by Hillsborough County, didn't hear she was too liberal for the district in 2018. Mostly she didn't hear anything, especially from Democratic Party leaders. Like Steele and Cattanach, Lewis , who is African American, was driven to run in 2018 by experience. The mother of an adult child who is autistic, she jumped through the hoops of Florida's health care system to get her child approved for services, only to wait four months without getting any help. After a long struggle with multiple bureaucracies, she wangled the care she needed for her daughter-and decided to run for the state Senate against entrenched GOP incumbent Tom Lee. \"Everyone,\" including many state Democratic leaders, \"said we were crazy,\" she recalls. \"No one would vote for us. But the party had somehow miscalculated how much this district was changing.\" She garnered an unexpected 46.5 percent of the vote, winning 52 percent in populous Hillsborough County. In 2020, Lee resigned, and suddenly the party had an open seat to contest. According to several reports, Democratic leaders approached at least two others to run, even though Lewis filed almost immediately after Lee's announcement. \"They said later they didn't know I was on the ballot,\" she says, sounding unconvinced.

Lewis benefited from a widely seen Zoom call in July led by Hillsborough County Democratic leader Ione Townsend with local Black leaders. When one asked about the party's lack of support for Lewis her second time around, Townsend replied, \"It's not high on our list because of where the polling was. What we do is, we prioritize based on our overall goals. White, Black, brown-it doesn't matter who that candidate is, it's where they fall on our election priority list.\" Angela Birdsong, a Hillsborough Democratic activist who ran for county commissioner in 2018, responded, \"I just think any Black woman in the race right now stands a chance and should be given a little more money than you might think they need. I just feel that you should give them more money!\" Lewis, like other women of color running for office this year, believes the widespread American revulsion over George Floyd's murder and the movement to end police violence buoy her campaign. For one thing, it has gotten people focused on the role of state and local leaders in reforming police departments. Here's where electing Democrats can matter-if not always enough. Colorado, which elected a Democratic trifecta over the past few cycles, did away with qualified immunity for police officers in June; New York, which completed a trifecta in 2018, enacted other criminal justice reforms. \"We now have a Black Senate leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and a Black Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie,\" the DLCC's Post says of New York. \"That's truly made a difference.\" Lewis talks about another benefit. \"I have had at least five white strangers call me out of the blue when George Floyd died,\" she says. \"They somehow found my website and said they were looking to support an African American woman running for office.\" (Source: National Conference of State Legislatures) B ut not all voters and, sadly, not all Democratic leaders feel the same way. The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable.

This year the RSLC is raising more money (it outraised the DLCC in the second quarter), and it's getting money from giant corporations. Its top five donors are Chevron, Dominion Energy, the tobacco giants Reynolds and Altria, and the private railway company BNSF. Meanwhile, Democratic state House and Senate caucuses have improved in supporting a broader range of challengers, but it's not enough, many outside groups say. \"Caucuses get a lot of money from incumbents, so they're focused on protecting them,\" Vaughan of Flippable says, accurately. Since the Virginia elections in 2017, which I covered intensively, I've heard that from challengers who weren't getting support-some of whom won anyway. \"I am a little worried about the GOP making a late play,\" admits Fiddler of Daily Kos . \"They're going to have lots of money. But they really haven't done the candidate recruitment they'd need to do,\" the kind they did to rustle up challengers to incumbent Democrats, especially in 2010. \"So I'm not sure. What do they have to work with?\" Geri Prado, the vice president for state and local campaigns for Emily's List, agrees. She's optimistic, with a few reservations, given the pandemic. \"Some of our candidates' individual fundraising is being hard hit, plus they're having to invest more in absentee voting,\" she notes. But she says that support from large institutional players like the DLCC and Emily's List, combined with some of the more progressive state Democratic caucuses' cooperation (however imperfect) with outside groups, will continue to improve and give Democrats an advantage this year. Stacey Abrams says the party has certainly strengthened its state legislative infrastructure since 2016. \"The DLCC is laser focused now,\" she says, while praising Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee \"and a lot of donors and outside activist groups.\" But \"the lack of participation by voters of color in 2010 was so problematic, Republicans were able to gerrymander.\" She, like a lot of people I spoke with, continues to worry that those voters are still being missed by some state outreach efforts. Even in Virginia in 2019, Bachman observes, \"Democrats keep underperforming,\" at least partly because outreach to voters scored as less likely to vote was sometimes undervalued when it came to door knocking, media buys, and direct mail. Virginia Democrats took control of both chambers but won only two state Senate seats, fewer than expected. \"Given the nature of the 2016 election, the voters who stayed home skewed to Democrats,\" she adds. \"It couldn't be more clear that the path to winning more seats is getting lower-propensity voters, particularly lower-propensity voters of color, engaged with our message and turning them out.\" That's especially true, Abrams says, since 2020 is another census year, with participation threatened by the pandemic and Trump administration malfeasance. \"If we do not have adequate participation by voters of color in November,\" she warns, \"gerrymandering will be worse than we've ever seen.\" Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article used a map that incorrectly depicted which political parties controlled state legislatures in 2019. The map has been corrected.\n\nIf Democrats recruited two alternative potential candidates for Lee's seat, they neglected a whole lot of other districts. That's where 90 for 90 came in. After the group's Virginia successes, it moved on to other states, helping recruit candidates where party leaders seemed unable or uninterested. In Florida the Reids reached out to Janelle Christensen, the energetic head of the state Democrats' environmental caucus. \"They explained the advantages of running in every district, and I said, 'Hey, I'm convinced,'\" she says. \"It's not necessarily that they're going to win, although they could, but they can cut the margins in red districts for Biden and educate people on our issues.\" She says she could fill maybe 10 challengers' seats with folks close to her caucus. \"But when I got started talking to them, they talked to their friends, and we recruited 36.\" 90 for 90 also worked to help with the unlikely candidates' state election filing fees, which are $1,800 each. Other national groups, including the DLCC, have since jumped into Florida. \"The conventional wisdom is there's no path to winning the Florida House. We have a contrarian view,\" says Hausman. As in Texas, there are districts that appear flippable, especially the 13 GOP-held seats that were won by either Clinton in 2016 or by gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in 2018. Still, many people feel the state party is undersupportive of its new insurgents. Inexplicably, challengers have had trouble getting access to VAN, a privately owned list of local voters, with names, addresses, and phone numbers, who have voted or might vote Democratic. \"It felt like the party was constantly trying to reinterpret the rules for who qualifies [to get VAN],\" Christensen says. \"But even once you get it, most of the numbers are bad. Nobody's even been trying in these districts, in some cases for decades. They're useless for anyone coming in trying to organize. If all we did in these races is build a list of interested Democrats in VAN, that's something.\" Sister District cofounder Gaby Goldstein, whose group is also working in Florida, says that's a common problem in red states, many of which it has targeted since its founding in 2016. \"In some places, we have to lay the basic groundwork because VAN is garbage. Many Democratic voter lists are garbage,\" she says. I have heard this a lot in red states and districts over the last four years.

The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable.

The surge of Black women running for office since Trump was elected is unmistakable. In North Carolina four Black women are running in statewide races, which Democrats believe will buoy Black turnout statewide. All over the country, an unprecedented number of women, many of them women of color, are stepping up. But some people worry these women and other state- level Democrats are not getting the support they need. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom? A Baby Bust Is More Likely.

      "text": "The Fearful and the Frustrated\n\nOn July 23rd, Donald Trump's red-white-and-navy-blue Boeing 757 touched down in Laredo, Texas, where the temperature was climbing to a hundred and four degrees. In 1976, the Times introduced Trump, then a little-known builder, to readers as a \"publicity shy\" wunderkind who \"looks ever so much like Robert Redford,\" and quoted an admiring observation from the architect Der Scutt: \"That Donald, he could sell sand to the Arabs.\" Over the years, Trump honed a performer's ear for the needs of his audience. He starred in \"The Apprentice\" for fourteen seasons, cultivating a lordly persona and a squint that combined Clint Eastwood on the high plains and Derek Zoolander on the runway. Once he emerged as the early front-runner for the Republican Presidential nomination, this summer, his airport comings and goings posed a delicate staging issue: a rogue wind off the tarmac could render his comb-over fully erect in front of the campaign paparazzi. So, in Laredo, Trump débuted a protective innovation: a baseball hat adorned with a campaign slogan that he recycled from Ronald Reagan's 1980 run for the White House-\"Make America Great Again!\" The headwear, which had the rigid façade and the braided rope of a cruise-ship giveaway, added an expeditionary element to the day's outfit, of blazer, pale slacks, golf shoes-well suited for a mission that he was describing as one of great personal risk. \"I may never see you again, but we're going to do it,\" he told Fox News on the eve of the Texas visit.\n\nWhen Trump announced his candidacy, on June 16th, he vowed to build a two-thousand-mile-long wall to stop Mexico from \"sending people that have lots of problems.\" He said, \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\" Three of the statements had no basis in fact-the crime rate among first-generation immigrants is lower than that for native-born Americans-but Trump takes an expansive view of reality. \"I play to people's fantasies,\" he writes in \"The Art of the Deal,\" his 1987 memoir. \"I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration-and a very effective form of promotion.\"\n\nTrump's campaign announcement was mocked and condemned-and utterly successful. His favorability among Republicans leaped from sixteen per cent to fifty-seven per cent, a greater spike than that of any other candidate's début. Immigration became the centerpiece of his campaign. \"Donald Trump has changed the entire debate on immigration,\" Rush Limbaugh told his listeners last month. As the climax of events in Las Vegas and Phoenix, Trump brought onstage Jamiel Shaw, Sr., whose seventeen-year-old son was killed, in 2008, by a man who was in the country illegally. Trump stood by while Shaw told the crowd how his son was shot.\n\nBefore departing for Laredo, Trump said, \"I've been invited by border patrols, and they want to honor me, actually, thousands and thousands of them, because I'm speaking up.\" Though Trump said \"border patrols,\" the invitation had in fact come from a local branch of the border-patrol union, and the local, after consulting with headquarters, withdrew the invitation a few hours before Trump arrived, on the ground that it would not endorse political candidates. Descending the airplane stairs, Trump looked thrilled to be arriving amid a controversy; he waded into a crowd of reporters and described the change of plans as the handiwork of unspecified enemies. \"They invited me, and then, all of a sudden, they were told, silencio! They want silence.\" Asked why he felt unsafe in Laredo-which has a lower crime rate than New York City or Washington, D.C.-he invoked another \"they\": \"Well, they say it's a great danger, but I have to do it. I love the country. There's nothing more important than what I'm doing.\"\n\nTrump was now going to meet with city officials instead of with the union. He disappeared into one of seven S.U.V.s, escorted by a dozen police vehicles-a larger motorcade than Mitt Romney merited as the Republican nominee. He passed shopping malls, churches, and ranch houses with satellite dishes in the front yard. Some drivers waved; others stared. A car had been positioned along the route with a sign across the windshield: \" Mr. Trump, Fuck U .\"\n\nHe reached the World Trade Bridge, a trucking link to Mexico, where he stepped inside an air-conditioned building for a half-hour briefing. He emerged to talk to reporters, and, after pausing to let the cameras set up, resumed his event. He was asked, \"You keep saying that there's a danger, but crime along the border is down. What danger are you talking about?\"\n\nTrump gave a tight, concerned nod. \"There's great danger with the illegals, and we were just discussing that. But we have a tremendous danger along the border, with the illegals coming in.\"\n\n\"Have you seen any evidence here to confirm your fears about Mexico sending its criminals across the border?\"\n\nAnother grave nod. \"Yes, I have, and I've heard it, and I've heard it from a lot of different people.\"\n\n\"What evidence, specifically, have you seen?\"\n\n\"We'll be showing you the evidence.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\nHe let that one pass.\n\n\"What do you say to the people on the radio this morning who called you a racist?\"\n\n\"Well, you know, we just landed, and there were a lot of people at the airport, and they were all waving American flags, and they were all in favor of Trump and what I'm doing.\" He shrugged-an epic, arms-splayed shrug.\n\n\"They were chanting against you.\"\n\n\"No, they were chanting for me.\"\n\n\"What would you do with the eleven million undocumented immigrants who are already here?\"\n\n\"The first thing we have to do is strengthen our borders, and after that we're going to have plenty of time to talk about that.\" He thanked everyone and retreated to the S.U.V.s.\n\nLink copied\n\nOn the way back to the airport, Trump stopped at the Paseo Real Reception Hall, where his supporters had assembled a small rally; guests were vetted at the door to keep out protesters. I sat beside a Latino family and asked the father what had attracted him to the event. He said that a friend involved in the border patrol had called him and asked him \"to take up the spaces.\" He'd brought five relatives. I asked what he thought of Trump's politics. He paused and said, \"I like his hotels.\" Trump told the group, \"I don't think that people understand the danger that you're under and the talent that you have. But I understand it.\" When he opened the floor to questions, José Diaz-Balart, an anchor for Telemundo and MSNBC, said, \"Many feel that what you said, when you said that people that cross the border are rapists and murderers-\"\n\nTrump cut him off: \"No, no, no! We're talking about illegal immigration, and everybody understands that. And you know what? That's a typical case of the press with misinterpretation.\" His supporters jeered at the reporter, and Trump shouted over the jeers: \"Telemundo should be ashamed!\"\n\nDiaz-Balart said, \"Can I finish?\"\n\n\"No, no. You're finished,\" Trump said. He did his thank-yous, flashed thumbs-up signs, and headed for his airplane.\n\nWhat accounts for Donald Trump's political moment? How did a real campaign emerge from a proposition so ludicrous that an episode of \"The Simpsons\" once used a Trump Presidency as the conceit for a dystopian future? The candidate himself is an unrewarding source of answers. Plumbing Trump's psyche is as productive as asking American Pharoah, the winner of the Triple Crown, why he runs. The point is what happens when he does.\n\nIn New Hampshire, where voters pride themselves on being unimpressed, Fred Rice, a Republican state representative, arrived at a Trump rally in the beach town of Hampton on an August evening, and found people waiting patiently in a two-hour line that stretched a quarter of a mile down the street. \"Never seen that at a political event before,\" he said. Other Republicans offer \"canned bullshit,\" Rice went on. \"People have got so terribly annoyed and disenchanted and disenfranchised, really, by candidates who get up there, and all their stump speeches promise everything to everyone.\" By the night's end, Rice was sold. \"I heard echoes of Ronald Reagan,\" he told me, adding, \"If I had to vote today, I would vote for Trump.\"\n\nTo inhabit Trump's landscape for a while, to chase his jet or stay behind with his fans in a half-dozen states, is to encounter a confederacy of the frustrated-less a constituency than a loose alliance of Americans who say they are betrayed by politicians, victimized by a changing world, and enticed by Trump's insurgency. Dave Anderson, a New Hampshire Republican who retired from United Parcel Service, told me, \"People say, 'Well, it'd be nice to have another Bush.' No, it wouldn't be nice. We had two. They did their duty. That's fine, but we don't want this Bush following what his brother did. And he's not coming across as very strong at all. He's not saying what Trump is saying. He's not saying what the issues are.\"\n\nTrump's constant talk of his money, his peering down on the one per cent (not to mention the ninety-nine), has helped him to a surprising degree. \"I love the fact that he wouldn't be owing anybody,\" Nancy Merz, a fifty-two-year-old Hampton Republican, told me. She worked at a furniture company, she said. \"But the industry went down the tubes.\" Her husband, Charlie, used to build household electricity meters at a General Electric plant, until the job moved to Mexico. Now he parks cars at a hospital. Trump, in his speech, promised to stop companies from sending jobs abroad, and the Merzes became Trump Republicans. They are churchgoers, but they don't expect Trump to become one, and they forgive his unpriestly comments about women. \"There are so many other things going on in this country that we've got be concerned about,\" Nancy said. \"I've seen a lot of our friends lose their houses.\"\n\nTrump's fans project onto him a vast range of imaginings-about toughness, business acumen, honesty-from a continuum that ranges from economic and libertarian conservatives to the far-right fringe. In partisan terms, his ideas are riven by contradiction-he calls for mass deportations but opposes cuts to Medicare and Social Security; he vows to expand the military but criticizes free trade-and yet that is a reflection of voters' often incoherent sets of convictions. The biggest surprise in Trump's following? He \"made an incredible surge among the Tea Party supporters,\" according to Patrick Murray, who runs polling for Monmouth University. Before Trump announced his candidacy, only twenty per cent of Tea Partiers had a favorable view of him; a month later, that figure had risen to fifty-six per cent. Trump became the top choice among Tea Party voters, supplanting (and opening a large lead over) Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Governor Scott Walker, of Wisconsin, both Tea Party stalwarts. According to a Washington Post /ABC News poll conducted last month, the \"broad majority\" of Trump's supporters hailed from two groups: voters with no college degree, and voters who say that immigrants weaken America. By mid-August, Trump was even closing in on Hillary Clinton. CNN reported that, when voters were asked to choose between the two, Clinton was leading fifty-one per cent to forty-five.\n\nIn Hampton, I dropped by Fast Eddie's Diner for the breakfast rush. \"He has my vote,\" Karen Mayer, a sixty-one-year-old human-resources manager, told me. Already? \"Already,\" she said. Her husband, Bob Hazelton, nodded in agreement. I asked what issue they cared about more than any other. \"Illegal immigration, because it's destroying the country,\" Mayer said. I didn't expect that answer in New Hampshire, I remarked. She replied, \"They're everywhere, and they are sucking our economy dry.\" Hazelton nodded again, and said, \"And we're paying for it.\"\n\nWhen the Trump storm broke this summer, it touched off smaller tempests that stirred up American politics in ways that were easy to miss from afar. At the time, I happened to be reporting on extremist white-rights groups, and observed at first hand their reactions to his candidacy. Trump was advancing a dire portrait of immigration that partly overlapped with their own. On June 28th, twelve days after Trump's announcement, the Daily Stormer, America's most popular neo-Nazi news site, endorsed him for President: \"Trump is willing to say what most Americans think: it's time to deport these people.\" The Daily Stormer urged white men to \"vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nEver since the Tea Party's peak, in 2010, and its fade, citizens on the American far right-Patriot militias, border vigilantes, white supremacists-have searched for a standard-bearer, and now they'd found him. In the past, \"white nationalists,\" as they call themselves, had described Trump as a \"Jew-lover,\" but the new tone of his campaign was a revelation. Richard Spencer is a self-described \"identitarian\" who lives in Whitefish, Montana, and promotes \"white racial consciousness.\" At thirty-six, Spencer is trim and preppy, with degrees from the University of Virginia and the University of Chicago. He is the president and director of the National Policy Institute, a think tank, co-founded by William Regnery, a member of the conservative publishing family, that is \"dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of European people in the United States and around the world.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Spencer \"a suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old.\" Spencer told me that he had expected the Presidential campaign to be an \"amusing freak show,\" but that Trump was \"refreshing.\" He went on, \"Trump, on a gut level, kind of senses that this is about demographics, ultimately. We're moving into a new America.\" He said, \"I don't think Trump is a white nationalist,\" but he did believe that Trump reflected \"an unconscious vision that white people have-that their grandchildren might be a hated minority in their own country. I think that scares us. They probably aren't able to articulate it. I think it's there. I think that, to a great degree, explains the Trump phenomenon. I think he is the one person who can tap into it.\"\n\nJared Taylor, the editor of American Renaissance , a white-nationalist magazine and Web site based in Oakton, Virginia, told me, in regard to Trump, \"I'm sure he would repudiate any association with people like me, but his support comes from people who are more like me than he might like to admit.\"\n\nFrom the beginning of the current race, the conservative establishment has been desperate for Trump to be finished. After he disparaged the war record of Senator John McCain, the New York Post gave him a front-page farewell-\" DON VOYAGE \"-and a Wall Street Journal editorial declared him a \"catastrophe.\" But Trump carried on-in part because he had activated segments of the electorate that other candidates could not, or would not. On July 20th, three days before his trip to Texas, Ann Coulter, whose most recent book is \"¡Adios, America! The Left's Plan to Turn Our Country Into a Third World Hellhole,\" appeared on Sean Hannity's show and urged fellow-Republicans to see Trump's summer as a harbinger. \"The new litmus test for real conservatives is immigration,\" she said. \"They used to say the same thing about the pro-life Republicans and the pro-gun Republicans, and, 'Oh, they're fringe and they're tacky, and we're so embarrassed to be associated with them.' Now every one of them comes along and pretends they'd be Reagan.\"\n\nFrom the pantheon of great demagogues, Trump has plucked some best practices-William Jennings Bryan's bombast, Huey Long's wit, Father Charles Coughlin's mastery of the airwaves-but historians are at pains to find the perfect analogue, because so much of Trump's recipe is specific to the present. Celebrities had little place in American politics until the 1920 Presidential election, when Al Jolson and other stars from the fledgling film industry endorsed Warren Harding. Two decades ago, Americans were less focussed on paid-for politicians, so Ross Perot, a self-funded billionaire candidate, did not derive the same benefit as Trump from the perception of independence.\n\nTrump's signature lines-\"The American dream is dead\" and \"We don't have victories anymore\"-constitute a bitter mantra in tune with a moment when the share of Americans who tell Gallup pollsters that there is \"plenty of opportunity\" has dropped to an unprecedented fifty-two per cent; when trust in government has reached its lowest level on record, and Americans' approval of both major parties has sunk, for the first time, below forty per cent. Matthew Heimbach, who is twenty-four, and a prominent white-nationalist activist in Cincinnati, told me that Trump has energized disaffected young men like him. \"He is bringing people back out of their slumber,\" he said.\n\nOrdinarily, the white-nationalist Web sites mock Republicans as Zionist stooges and corporate puppets who have opened the borders in order to keep wages low. But, on July 9th, VDARE, an opinion site founded to \"push back the plans of pro-Amnesty/Immigration Surge politicians, ethnic activists and corrupt Big Business,\" hailed Trump as \"the first figure with the financial, cultural, and economic resources to openly defy elite consensus. If he can mobilize Republicans behind him and make a credible run for the Presidency, he can create a whole new media environment for patriots to openly speak their mind without fear of losing their jobs.\" The piece was headlined \" WE ARE ALL DONALD TRUMP NOW .\"\n\nTrump's admirers hear in his words multiple appeals. Michael Hill heads the Alabama-based League of the South, a secessionist group that envisions an independent Southern republic with an \"Anglo-Celtic\" leadership. In 1981, Hill began teaching history at Stillman College, a historically black college in Tuscaloosa. He applied for jobs at other schools, and was turned down, which he attributes to affirmative action. In 1994, he co-founded the League, which put him at odds, he said, with \"civil-rights-age, older black faculty and administrators, looking down their nose at this uppity white boy coming out here, talking about the Confederate flag and all that kind of stuff.\" In 1999, he left Stillman. He told me, \"If academia is not for me, because of who I am-a white Southern male, Christian, straight, whatever-then I'm going to find something that is. I'm going to fight this battle for my people.\" Hill was moved by Trump's frequent references to Kathryn Steinle, a thirty-two-year-old woman who, on July 1st, was walking with her father on a pier in San Francisco when she was fatally wounded in what police described as a random shooting. When police arrested Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a repeat felon who had been deported from the United States five times, Trump adopted the story of \"that beautiful woman\" as \"another example of why we must secure our border immediately.\" Hill told me, \"That struck such a nerve with people, because a lot of this political stuff is abstract, but, as a father, I've got a daughter as well, and I could just see myself holding my daughter, and her looking up at me and saying, 'Help me, Daddy.' \" Hill, who condemns immigration and interracial marriage and warns of the influence of \"Jewry,\" said, \"I love to see somebody like Donald Trump come along. Not that I believe anything that he says. But he is stirring up chaos in the G.O.P., and for us that is good.\"\n\nI joined Hill at a League of the South meeting one afternoon in July, at its newly built headquarters, on a couple of verdant acres outside Montgomery, Alabama. It was the League's annual conference, and there were about a hundred men and women; the older men were in courtly suits or jackets, and the younger set favored jeans, with handguns holstered in the waistband. The venders' tables had books (\"The True Selma Story,\" \"Authentic History of the Ku Klux Klan\"), stickers (\"The Federal Empire Is Killing the American Dream\"), and raffle tickets. The prize: a .45-calibre Sig Sauer pistol.\n\nLink copied\n\nAfter years of decline, the League has recently acquired a number of younger members, including Brad Griffin, a thirty-four-year-old who writes an influential blog under the name Hunter Wallace. Short and genial, he wore Top-Siders, khaki shorts, and a polo shirt. As we talked, Griffin's eyes wandered to his two-year-old son, who was roaming nearby. Griffin told me that he embraced white nationalism after reading Patrick Buchanan's \"Death of the West,\" which argued, in Griffin's words, that \"all of the European peoples were dying out, their birthrates were low, and you had mass immigration and multiculturalism.\" Griffin once had high hopes for the Tea Party. \"They channelled all that rage into electing an impressive number of Republicans in the South, but then all they did was try to cut rich Republicans' taxes and make life easier for billionaires!\" he said. \"It was all hijacked, and a classic example of how these right-wing movements emerge, and they're misdirected into supporting the status quo.\"\n\nGriffin had recently told his readers that his opinion of Donald Trump was \"soaring.\" He sees Trump's surge as a \"hostile takeover of the Republican Party. He's blowing up their stage-managed dog-and-pony show.\" Griffin is repelled by big-money politics, so I asked why he spoke highly of Trump. \"He's a billionaire, but all of these other little candidates are owned by their own little billionaires.\" He mentioned Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers. \"So I think Trump is independent.\"\n\nThe longer I stayed, the more I sensed that my fellow-attendees occupied a parallel universe in which white Americans face imminent demise, the South is preparing to depart the United States, and Donald Trump is going to be President. When Hill took the stage, he told his compatriots that the recent lowering of the Confederate flag was just the beginning. Soon, he warned, adopting the unspecified \"they,\" they will come for the \"monuments, battlefields, parks, cemeteries, street names, even the dead themselves.\" The crowd was on its feet, cheering him on. \"This, my friends, is cultural genocide,\" he said, adding, \"Often, as history has shown, cultural genocide is merely a prelude to physical genocide.\" I ducked out to catch a flight to Des Moines: Trump was speaking the next day in Iowa.\n\nThe \"Make America Great Again Rally and Family Picnic\" in Oskaloosa (population: 11,463) opened at eleven, but by ten there was already a crowd of thirteen hundred people-almost twice the capacity of the auditorium. The buffet was serving free pulled-pork sandwiches, and Trump's warmup act, Tana Goertz (runner-up, \"The Apprentice,\" Season 3), told the crowd, \"Please go eat! Mr. Trump can't take all this food home on the plane!\"\n\nIt must be stated clearly that (to the delight of the far-right extremists I spoke with) a great many Republicans are mortified by Trump-horrified by his campaign of fear, embarrassed that others in the Party are not, and desperate to move on. But Trump's strategy has its logic. Gary Johnson, who as a Republican served two terms as the governor of New Mexico, before becoming the 2012 Libertarian Party Presidential candidate, told me that anyone who runs for office discovers that some portion of the electorate is available to be enraged and manipulated, if a candidate is willing to do it. \"I ran across this constantly,\" he said. \"This eight per cent out there that bangs their fist on the table and says, 'The biggest problem we're facing is immigration!' And I'm going, 'No! No! This is not the case!' \" Johnson cited a poll that at that point put Trump's support among Republicans at eighteen per cent, and told me, \"I don't think there's an eighteen-per-cent element of this country that is just outright racist. But there is a segment out there that is, and he has definitely appealed to that.\" Most people, in Johnson's view, are animated by other parts of Trump's pitch-\"that he's going to get in and make the tough deals, and nobody's going to screw with him, because he'll drop bombs.\" That coalition-the fearful and the frustrated-is powerful. \"That's how you begin to get to eighteen per cent,\" Johnson said.\n\nAs people turned up in Oskaloosa, I encountered some of the fearful. A construction worker named Ron James, wearing a T-shirt that said \"Every-Juan Illegal Go Home,\" told me that the \"invasion of illegals\" is eroding American culture: \"We're getting flushed down the toilet.\" But the vast majority of the room, as best I could tell, was more like Stephanie DeVolder, an elegant fiftysomething, with blond hair and bright-green eyes, who had worked as a sales rep for Dice, a job-search site. She was glad that Trump had \"brought up the horrific treatment of the veterans,\" and that \"he is a foremost believer in the military,\" and she admired his work on television. \"I bought the videos of 'The Apprentice,' and watched the whole thing,\" she said. \"He is a phenomenal judge of character, and he actually does have a heart. He is absolutely amazing.\" His fame had guided her to his political views, and, in time, she had concluded that he was \"absolutely right about border security.\"\n\nEmerging from the wings, in a navy suit, a white shirt, and a pink tie, Trump paused midway across the stage to spread his arms in a gesture of astonished, grateful embrace. For years, Trump has been compared to P. T. Barnum, but the comparison doesn't capture his range; on the campaign trail, he is less the carnival barker than the full cast-the lion, the fire-eater, the clown with the seltzer-all trussed into a single-breasted Brioni suit. Music from the \"Karate Kid\" soundtrack blared-\"You're the best around! Nothing's gonna ever keep you down!\"-and, for a moment, Trump looked genuinely startled by the ardor of the stargazers in the crowd. At the lectern, he said, \"It's a terrific place, Iowa.\" Then he monologued for an hour, off the cuff, on Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server (\"What she did is very criminal\"); Scott Walker (\"Finally, I can attack!\"); the Veterans Administration (\"the most corrupt group of people in all of Washington\").\n\nAs always, he created a powerful set piece about Mexican criminals who are allowed to \"roam around, shooting people and killing people,\" as he put it. He described this as a hidden scourge: \"Such a big problem, and nobody wants to talk about it.\" He reminded the crowd of his trip to Laredo: \"I told the pilots, I said, 'Fly a little bit away from the border, please. Fly a little bit inland.' It's a whole scary thing.\" He said that when he returned to New York his wife had greeted him in tears. \"You made it safely from the border!\" she cried. As always, he spoke of Kathryn Steinle's murder-\"Kate, beautiful Kate\"-and of the death of Jamiel Shaw's son, \"shot by an animal, an animal that shouldn't have been in this country.\" He urged Iowans to be afraid, even if they didn't see the threat. \"When you're afraid to walk into your own country, it's pretty bad,\" he said. \"Hard to believe. You don't have that problem in Iowa, in all fairness. But it's pretty rough out there.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nOver the years, Trump has rejected the suggestion that he is a \"belligerent, loudmouthed racist,\" as Paul Krugman, the Times columnist, put it recently. \"I have a great relationship with the blacks,\" Trump said on the radio, in 2011.\n\nTrump has always weaved in and out of racially charged controversies. In 2000, he secretly ran ads opposing a Catskills casino backed by the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, because it would rival his businesses in Atlantic City. Beneath a picture of drug paraphernalia, the ad asked, \"Are these the new neighbors we want?\" Tribal leaders denounced the message as \"racist and inflammatory,\" and Trump and his associates were fined by New York State for concealing the true source of the ads. In March, 2011, Trump, who was considering a Presidential run, resurrected the crackpot theory that Barack Obama is not an American citizen, declaring, \"I want him to show his birth certificate.\" (It had already been publicly available for more than three years.) Trump's declaration gave the issue new prominence. At the time, Trump's on-again, off-again political adviser, the former Nixon aide Roger Stone, said that the decision to become a birther was \"a brilliant base-building move.\"\n\nTrump's phantasmagorical visions of marauding immigrants are part of a genre in which immigration and race are intermingled. In recent years, hoaxes and theories that were once confined to the margins have been laundered through mainstream media outlets. In 2013, Fox News repeatedly broadcast warnings about the \"knockout game,\" based on a self-published book by the white nationalist Colin Flaherty, which described black men randomly attacking white pedestrians. In a study published in the journal Race & Class , Mike King, a sociologist at SUNY -Oneonta, searched for a single actual case of the knockout game and found none. The news reports were largely patched together from unrelated viral videos of street violence. Bureau of Justice statistics show, King wrote, a \"marked decrease in random assaults, including black assaults on white strangers.\"\n\nWhen Trump started emphasizing the mortal threat posed by undocumented immigration, America's white nationalists rejoiced. \"Why are whites supposed to be happy about being reduced to a minority?\" Jared Taylor, of American Renaissance , asked me. \"It's clear why Hispanics celebrate diversity: 'More of us! More Spanish! More cucaracha!' \"\n\nTaylor, who calls himself a \"racial dissident,\" was slim and decorous in gray trousers and a button-down when we met. For years, he and others have sensed an opportunity on the horizon to expand their ranks. When Obama was elected in 2008, Stormfront, the leading white-supremacist Web forum, crashed from heavy traffic. The Klan, weakened by lawsuits and infighting, barely exists anymore, but the Internet draws in young racists like Dylann Roof, who is accused of the June 17th massacre of nine people at a church in Charleston. The attack inspired a broad effort to remove the Confederate flag-from the state capitol and from the shelves of Amazon and of Walmart and a host of other retail stores. Defenders of the flag were galvanized, and they organized more than a hundred rallies around the South, interpreting the moment, months after racial unrest in Ferguson and Baltimore, as a sign of a backlash against political correctness and multiculturalism. Trump's language landed just as American hate groups were more energized than at any time in years. Griffin, the blogger for the League of the South, told me that the removal of the flag had crystallized \"fears that people have about what happens when we become a minority. What happens when we have no control over things? You're seeing it play out right now.\"\n\nOver sandwiches in the dining room of Taylor's brick Colonial, with views of a spacious back yard, a half-hour from downtown Washington, D.C., five of his readers and friends shared their views on race and politics, on the condition that I not use their full names. They were white men, in white-collar jobs, and each had a story of radicalization: Chris, who wore a pink oxford shirt and a tie, and introduced himself as an employee of \"Conservativism, Inc.,\" the Republican establishment, said that he had graduated from a public high school where there were frequent shootings, but he felt he was supposed to \"ignore the fact that we were not safe on a day-to-day basis because of all of these blacks and the other immigrants in our schools.\"\n\nJason, a muscle-bound commercial-real-estate broker in a polo shirt, said, \"I've had personnel-in strict, frightened confidence-just tell me, 'Hey, look, we're just hiring minorities, so don't appeal, don't come back.' \" This sense of \"persecution,\" as he called it, is widely held. In a study published in 2011, Michael Norton, a professor at Harvard Business School, and Samuel Sommers, a professor of psychology at Tufts, found that more than half of white Americans believe that whites have replaced blacks as \"the primary victims of discrimination\" today, even though, as Norton and Sommers write, \"by nearly any metric-from employment to police treatment, loan rates to education-statistics continue to indicate drastically poorer outcomes for Black than White Americans.\"\n\nThe men around the table, unlike previous generations of white nationalists, were inspired not by nostalgia for slavery but by their dread of a time when non-Hispanic whites will no longer be the largest demographic group in America. They uniformly predicted a violent future. Erick, who wore a Captain America T-shirt and unwittingly invoked one of Trump's signature phrases, told me, \"The American dream is dead, and the American nightmare is just beginning. I believe it's that way. I think that whites don't know the terror that's upon us.\"\n\nAll the men wanted to roll back anti-discrimination laws in order to restore restrictive covenants and allow them to carve out all-white enclaves. Henry, a twenty-six-year-old with cropped blond hair, said, \"We all see some hope in Donald Trump, because it's conceivable that he could benefit the country in a way that we feel would be helpful.\"\n\nIn early August, the Republican candidates convened in Cleveland for their first debate. I watched it on television with Matthew Heimbach, the young white nationalist in Cincinnati, and some of his friends. Heimbach, whom anti-racist activists call \"the Little Fuhrer,\" for his tirades against \"rampant multiculturalism,\" founded the Traditionalist Youth Network, a far-right group that caters to high-school and college students and pushes for the separation of blacks and whites. Stocky and bearded, Heimbach is ambitious. He graduated, in 2013, from Towson University, in Maryland, where he attracted controversy for forming a \"white student union.\" He has met with European Fascists, including members of the Golden Dawn, in Greece.\n\nLink copied\n\nHeimbach rents part of a house on a placid side street and works as a landscaper. He and his wife recently had their first child, a boy named Nicholas. When I asked Heimbach how he got involved with Fascist politics, he laughed. \"I was not raised like this,\" he said. \"I was raised to be a normal small-town Republican.\" The son of teachers in Poolesville, Maryland, an hour from Washington, he, like Brad Griffin, credited Buchanan's book \"Death of the West\" for seeding his conception of a desolate future. \"Even if you play the game, even if you do everything right, then the future, when it comes to your income, when it comes to benefits, when it comes to everything, we are going to be the first generation in American history to be living worse than our parents.\" He went on, \"My own parents tell me, 'Well, you should just shut up, you should go get a normal job, and get a two-car garage, and then you'll be happy.' \"\n\nOn the economics, Heimbach's narrative is not wrong. During a half-century of change in the American labor market-the rise of technology and trade, the decline of manual labor-nobody has been hit harder than low-skilled, poorly educated men. Between 1979 and 2013, pay for men without a college degree fell by twenty-one per cent in real terms; for women with similar credentials, pay rose by three per cent, thanks partly to job opportunities in health care and education. Like many ultraconservatives, Heimbach had largely given up on the Republican Party. He said, \"We need to get the white community to actually start speaking for the white community, instead of letting a bunch of Republicans that hate us anyway, and don't speak for our values, be the unofficial spokespeople.\"\n\nDuring the debate, Mike Huckabee was asked how he might attract enough support from independents and Democrats to get elected, and Heimbach shouted at the TV, \"You don't need to! All you need to do is get the Republican base to get out and vote.\"\n\nOn a couch across from the television, Tony Hovater, who used to be a drummer in a band and now works as a welder, said that, from what he has heard from Trump, he suspects that Trump shares his fears about immigration but can't say so openly. Hovater told me, \"I think he's, like, dog-whistling,\" adding, \"He's saying we should probably favor more European immigration, or maybe more of just a meritocracy sort of system, but he's not coming out and saying it, because people will literally stamp him: 'Oh, you just hate Mexicans.' \" Hovater hopes that Trump will find a way to be more forthright: \"Why not just say it?\"\n\nFor his part, Hovater hopes to get into politics. This fall, he's running for City Council in New Carlisle, Ohio, representing what he and Heimbach have named the Traditional Workers Party. He is taking inspiration from Trump's populist success. \"Just like we're seeing with Trump, if the people honestly feel like you're fighting for them, they'll rally behind you,\" he said. He knows that his views are \"extreme,\" but Trump's success tells him that people support tone over substance. \"People will be, like, 'Well, I'll take the fighter, even though I might disagree with him on some things,' \" he said.\n\nAs the debate wound down, Trump, in his final statement, recited his mantra of despair. \"Our country is in serious trouble. We don't win anymore,\" he said. \"We can't do anything right.\" Matthew Parrott, a Web developer who was sipping coffee from a cup adorned with a swastika, said, \"He was sassy without being comical. He struck exactly the tone he needed to give the people supporting him exactly what they want more of.\" He went on, \"The political system hasn't been providing an outlet for social-conservative populism. You had this Ron Paul revolution, and all the stuff about cutting taxes, small government, and that's just not the electrifying issue that they were expecting it to be. Simple folks, they want the border secure. They want what Donald Trump is mirroring at them. I think he's an intelligent businessman who identified what the people want to hear. He's made a living finding these sorts of opportunities.\"\n\nTrump emerged from the debate on a wrathful tear. When Megyn Kelly, the Fox News host, asked him to explain why he called some women \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals,\" Trump replied, \"What I say is what I say.\" In an interview the next day, he said that Kelly had \"blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\" In the attendant uproar, Trump played dumb, declaring that only a \"deviant\" would think he was referring to menstruation, when he was thinking only of her nose.\n\nThe Republican commentariat celebrated what finally seemed to be Trump's immolation. A couple of days after the debate, Stephanie DeVolder, in Iowa, e-mailed me to say that Trump had lost her. \"I am not offended by his comments (as much as I am embarrassed for him and his family).\" She had soured on his \"bullying,\" and his \"total disregard for manners.\"\n\nThe polls did not follow suit, though. Trump not only remained the front-runner-ahead of Bush and Cruz and the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, depending on the poll-but broadened his lead. (Two weeks after the debate, DeVolder changed her mind on Trump again. \"I forgave him, as his message/platform continues to resonate above all else,\" she wrote to me.)\n\nOn August 16th, with the media in full summer frenzy, Trump made his first detailed proposal, a six-page immigration plan that outlined an unprecedented crackdown. Presented as the remedy for a victimized nation-\"We will not be taken advantage of anymore\"-Trump's plan called for the government to deport large segments of the undocumented population, seize money that these immigrants attempt to send home, and, contravening the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, deny citizenship to their U.S.-born children.\n\nThe Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based organization that seeks to reduce immigration (it is classified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center), hailed Trump's plan as the \"American Workers' Bill of Rights.\" Mark Meckler, the co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, described it as a new standard \"that all the other candidates will now have to meet,\" and Scott Walker immediately echoed Trump's call for building a wall and ending birthright citizenship. Other Republicans recoiled, convinced that Trump's nativist turn would taint the Party's image as ruinously as Mitt Romney's \"self-deportation\" comments in his race against Barack Obama. At the time, Trump himself disapproved of Romney's approach, saying, in November, 2012, \"He had a crazy policy of 'self- deportation,' which was maniacal. It sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote. He lost the Asian vote. He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.\" Trump now faced the risk that his new stance could eventually undo him.\n\nOn Tuesday of last week, Jorge Ramos, the most influential Latino news anchor, told his audience on the Fusion network, \"Right now Donald Trump is, no question, the loudest voice of intolerance, hatred, and division in the United States.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nBefore dawn on Wednesday, two brothers from South Boston allegedly attacked a homeless Hispanic man, breaking his nose and urinating on his face. The police said that, after the men were arrested, one of them, Scott Leader, justified the assault by saying, \"Donald Trump was right-all these illegals need to be deported.\" (Both men pleaded not guilty.) When Trump was asked at a press conference about the case, and about threats of other violence, he replied, \"I think that would be a shame, but I haven't heard about that. I will say that people that are following me are very passionate. They love this country, and they want this country to be great again, and they are very passionate, I will say that.\" (Two days later, Trump, under fire, tweeted, \"Boston incident is terrible. . . . I would never condone violence.\")\n\nWhen Trump leaped to the head of the Republican field, he delivered the appearance of legitimacy to a moral vision once confined to the fevered fringe, elevating fantasies from the message boards and campgrounds to the center stage of American life. In doing so, he pulled America into a current that is coursing through other Western democracies-Britain, France, Spain, Greece, Scandinavia-where xenophobic, nationalist parties have emerged since the 2008 economic crisis to besiege middle-ground politicians. In country after country, voters beset by inequality and scarcity have reached past the sober promises of the center-left and the center-right to the spectre of a transcendent solution, no matter how cruel. \"The more complicated the problem, the simpler the demands become,\" Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at the University of California in San Diego, told me. \"When people get frustrated and irritated, they want to cut the Gordian knot.\"\n\nTrump has succeeded in unleashing an old gene in American politics-the crude tribalism that Richard Hofstadter named \"the paranoid style\"-and, over the summer, it replicated like a runaway mutation. Whenever Americans have confronted the reshuffling of status and influence-the Great Migration, the end of Jim Crow, the end of a white majority-we succumb to the anti-democratic politics of absolutism, of a \"conflict between absolute good and absolute evil,\" in which, Hofstadter wrote, \"the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to a finish. Nothing but complete victory will do.\" Trump was born to the part. \"I'll do nearly anything within legal bounds to win,\" he wrote, in \"The Art of the Deal.\" \"Sometimes, part of making a deal is denigrating your competition.\" Trump, who long ago mastered the behavioral nudges that could herd the public into his casinos and onto his golf courses, looked so playful when he gave out Lindsey Graham's cell-phone number that it was easy to miss just how malicious a gesture it truly was. It expressed the knowledge that, with a single utterance, he could subject an enemy to that most savage weapon of all: us.\n\nTrump's candidacy has already left a durable mark, expanding the discourse of hate such that, in the midst of his feuds and provocations, we barely even registered that Senator Ted Cruz had called the sitting President \"the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism,\" or that Senator Marco Rubio had redoubled his opposition to abortion in cases of rape, incest, or a mortal threat to the mother. Trump has bequeathed a concoction of celebrity, wealth, and alienation that is more potent than any we've seen before. If, as the Republican establishment hopes, the stargazers eventually defect, Trump will be left with the hardest core-the portion of the electorate that is drifting deeper into unreality, with no reconciliation in sight. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Happy Trails\n\nForty-one years ago, my uncle Hector said he was hitchhiking to Spokane, walked out the door, and disappeared. I was only seven years old and he was my favorite relative. He'd be seventy-two now. He left as a randomly employed blue-collar reservation alcoholic, but, if he hadn't vanished, he probably would have sobered up and become a tribal elder. Indian men live wild-horse lives, running beautiful and dangerous, until some outside force-some metaphorical cowboy-breaks them. I imagine that Hector, in his senior years, would be the Head Man Traditional Dancer at every third powwow. He'd probably be as fat as I've become. Indian dudes come in two sizes: the slender, androgynous boys who make the girls go crazy and the aging men who, with their big bellies, skinny legs, and fossilized feet, look like overfed chickens.\n\nOver the years, I've lost two other uncles and three aunts, to cancer, heart disease, and car wrecks. One uncle survives, in Seattle, but I rarely see him. My father died, from diabetes, seven years ago. I've got three cousins in prison, three living in poverty on our reservation, and a beautiful and distant cousin who married a Lakota and moved to South Dakota. When we were twelve, we made out in a tree house. I still think she's the most beautiful woman who's ever lived. And I loved her so much, romantically and inappropriately, that I've never bothered to kiss any other woman.\n\nBest thing my gorgeous cousin said to me: \"If we lived in Old England, then we could get married. If we were royalty, then we could have a dozen babies.\"\n\nI still live with my mother. The rest of the world would call me a failure, I suppose, but Indians don't judge adult Indians for remaining in the family home. Everything-our worst losses and our greatest beauty-is deemed sacred and necessary.\n\nBest thing my mother ever said to me: \"You know what's inside an Indian self-help book? Pictures of other self-help books.\"\n\nAnyway, four decades after my uncle Hector walked into nothingness, I decided that we needed to bury him.\n\n\"But there's no body,\" my mother said.\n\n\"Don't need one,\" I said. \"We can bury the memory of him.\"\n\n\"I think he might still be alive,\" she said.\n\n\"If he were still alive he would have come back. Or written a letter. Or called. Something. Hector was too good to leave us hanging.\"\n\n\"He was a good man.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"A great man.\"\n\nActually, Hector was only sometimes great. But we need to make the dead better people than they were, because it makes us look better for loving them. Mostly, Hector was a temperamental asshole. He drank, did drugs, and got into fistfights like he thought every white man was a cavalry soldier. I knew that, as he hitchhiked toward Spokane, he'd picked a fight with the wrong guy, or a group of toughs, and had been beaten to death. I was no visionary, but whenever I closed my eyes I could see his bones scattered and scoured by wind and wild animals. I could see the holes pounded into his skull. With a tire iron. I can hear that metal striking bone. That was Hector's destiny. Violent men die violently. Warriors get murdered.\n\nBecause my mother was good at funerals (she cooked, cleaned, sang, drummed, and held the hand of whichever mourner was hurting the most at any particular time), she decided that, yes, it was time to hold Hector's wake. Most of the tribe came to mourn Hector. We sang the correct songs, gave the proper eulogies, and stayed awake for two days.\n\nBest part of the funeral: We had an open and empty casket.\n\nBest joke about the open and empty casket: \"Hector was such a showoff that I'm surprised he hasn't come back from the dead to lie in his coffin and die again.\"\n\nBest sad thing said about Hector: \"He wasn't afraid of any white man. But white men weren't afraid of him, either.\"\n\nWe put the empty coffin in a truck bed and hauled it over to the Catholic cemetery.\n\nYeah, we Coeur d'Alene Indians are the best Catholics you're ever going to meet. When we eat the bread and drink the wine we're eating and drinking Jesus, Mary, and all twelve of the Apostles, even that traitor Judas.\n\nWe lowered Hector's coffin into the ground and, after everybody had thrown a handful of dirt into the grave, we buried him completely. Then everybody went away.\n\nBest thing said in parting: \"A hundred years from now, white archeologists are going to open that coffin, find it empty, and wonder what it all means.\"\n\nThen, at the graveside, as the starlings pulled down the sun and the mosquitoes raised the moon, it was just my mother and me. She whisper-sang an old mourning song. I didn't know it, so I couldn't sing with her. My mother could be stingy like that. Keeping the old traditions locked inside her rib cage. She'd rather let them die than have them corrupted by a cell-phone Indian like me.\n\nAnyway, as she sang, I stared at Hector's wooden grave marker, carved with his name, date of birth and date of disappearance, and a few random tribal glyphs. I wondered if it was possible for an Indian to die peacefully. I've got a photograph of Hector, as a baby, being held by his grandmother Agnes. She was born before the Civil War, so, yes, my favorite uncle was only one degree removed from slavery. Agnes was a teen-ager, living on the newly created Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation, when Custer and his soldiers were righteously killed at Little Bighorn, in Montana. Hector was only one degree removed from the Indian Wars. And Agnes was the mother of three kids, the first generation of our tribe to be born and live in a house with four walls, when the U.S. Army got its revenge by massacring hundreds of unarmed old people, women, and children at the so-called Battle of Wounded Knee, in South Dakota. Hector was only one degree removed from genocide. How could he have become anything other than a violent man who died violently?\n\nYes, crime begets crime begets crime begets an Indian man who probably hitched a ride with some drunken, seemingly friendly white boys who killed him. Or wait, no. Here's the thing that I don't want to admit. Here's the thing that no Indian wants to admit. Hector wouldn't have fallen prey to any carnivorous white men. He wouldn't have got into a car with white strangers. Or gone to some party where only white men would be present.\n\nOn that last day we saw him, setting off for Spokane, Hector would have accepted a ride only from other Indians-and only from Indians he knew. So Hector was almost certainly murdered and disappeared by another Coeur d'Alene Indian or by a war party of his own tribal members. I imagine it was mostly an accident. They were probably drinking too hard, as they were always drinking too hard. And, drunk, Hector probably insulted somebody. Or admitted that he'd fucked somebody's wife or girlfriend or daughter. And then they'd probably parked the car on a back road so that Hector and his opponent could fight it out. Half-assed warrior against half-assed warrior. And I imagine that a lucky punch shattered Hector's skull. Or maybe Hector challenged everybody to a fight. Maybe he decided he was tough enough to kick the shit out of every Indian at the same time. Maybe he thought he could kill the world and instead learned that the world is undefeated.\n\nAs I sat at my uncle's empty grave, I hoped that the Indians who killed Hector had sung him an honor song when they buried his body deep in the woods. I wished that one of those killers would send me an anonymous letter and tell me where the body was buried. So I could disinter my uncle, carry him to the cemetery, and fill the empty space in his coffin with his bones.\n\nI imagined that all my aunts, uncles, and cousins were buried in Hector's empty coffin. I knew my late father was also in that grave.\n\nBest thing my father ever said to me: \"All my kids were accidents. But you're the best accident. You're a car wreck with eagle feathers.\"\n\nStanding in that cemetery, I felt like the only Indian that mattered and the only Indian that didn't. I was alive, damn it, and I planned to live longer than every other Indian in the world. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Pam. Photo Albums, $10 each. Lakewood.\n\n_Each day this week, the Book Bench will feature an excerpt from \"It Chooses You,\" by Miranda July. The book, to be published on November 15th, recounts July's adventures with a series of strangers she met through the classified ads in the PennySaver. The encounters helped her finish the script for her film \"The Future\"-and one of the strangers played a key role in it. _\n\nPam could not believe we were seeing her house when it was such a mess. We assured her that it looked very clean, which it did-clean and chaotically filled with art. Gainsborough's The Blue Boy, The Hunt of the Unicorn, and various other familiaresque images had been meticulously re-created in needlepoint, by Pam, over the years. We settled ourselves around a large stack of albums and I lifted one onto my lap.\n\nMiranda: Where did these come from?\n\nPam: One of my friends, he has a friend, and that friend had a big sale. I keep looking at the first album and the second one, and I said, \"Oh my god, that's interesting. I wish I could go on vacation like this lady here.\"\n\nAs she talked I flipped though the album, and then another one. They were all filled with pictures of the same wealthy white couple-beginning with their wedding in the '50s and ending with the last of their cruises.\n\nPam: These people, they are going all over the world. To Greece and Italy and Japan, and it is gorgeous wherever. It really is nice, and someday maybe I wish I can go, but no money this time. My life, I get married so young and I have no time for vacation. And I say, Well, I can look at this pictures-is better than no vacation.\n\nMiranda: So you don't know these people?\n\nPam: No, I don't know the people, but I don't want the albums to be thrown away. I keep almost like ten years actually, in my house.\n\nI glanced at her, wondering if she was a bit of a hoarder. She wore a pink sleeveless top, not unlike Michael's, and her baroque decorating style made her seem older than she was. I guessed she was forty-eight. An exhausted forty-eight.\n\nMiranda: What do you imagine their life was like?\n\nPam: I think they have very, very good life. Nice, happy life, actually, if you living that long.\n\nMiranda: Yeah, they're pretty old in some of these.\n\nPam: Yeah, is very, very old, and is nice not only that they go, but it is nice to see them be happy with each other. Look at him, and he is just smiling, and it's nice. I always feel so good to see somebody really happy.\n\nMiranda: Do you think they died pretty old?\n\nPam: Yeah, I think the lady is like ninety-five and the guy ninety, yeah.\n\nMiranda: I'm surprised their kids wouldn't have taken these. Wouldn't you think -\n\nPam: They don't have kids, yeah. They don't have kids.\n\nMiranda: So when did you move from Greece? How old were you?\n\nPam: I was seventeen. I got married and I come here, and then after I had three kids.\n\nMiranda: Right away?\n\nPam: Yeah, after a year.\n\nMiranda: So you were eighteen. And what did you do?\n\nPam: We work in restaurants, fixing food.\n\nMiranda: So you had a restaurant?\n\nPam: Yeah. Twenty years one, and thirteen years another one.\n\nPam opened another album, and as we looked at pictures of the rich, white strangers on a boat, I had the queasy feeling that I was Pam, in reverse. She'd invented all kinds of happiness for these people who seemed boring to me, while her immigrant story struck me as inherently poignant and profound. And probably neither of us was entirely wrong; it's just that we were, more than anything, sick of our own problems.\n\nMiranda: And has anyone called about the albums to buy them?\n\nPam: Yeah, a lot of people, but -\n\nMiranda: But they don't buy them.\n\nPam: Yeah. But I can't throw them out. I used to have one customer in the restaurant, she was like ninety-five years old. Her name was Meg. She was so sweet. She come in every day at eleven o'clock and she eat. And this lady, she's doing a job kind of like your job, she goes to people and takes pictures and talks to somebody. And then after she's like sixty-five years old, you know what she does? She takes pictures of herself every day. And she goes home, and she puts them in the scrap album. She was so careful-three rooms like this high, thick, thick with albums. And then one day she passed away. And the son-in-law, he take all the albums and put everything in the dumpster. It's so sad. That's why I took these albums, so they wouldn't get thrown in a dumpster, you know? That's sad to me.\n\nAt age sixty-five, an age so far past young as to be almost unfeminine, a woman had decided to photograph herself every single day. It was immediately one of my favorite works of art, all the more significant because she wasn't Sophie Calle or Tracey Emin. She knew no one would clamor for the three rooms' worth of albums; their value was entirely self-defined. And though of course I wished I had somehow saved the albums, the performance had to end with her dying and the collection being thrown into the dumpster. It was the ending that really made you think.\n\nI bought a few of Pam's albums, and when I got home I forced myself to look at the pictures of the couple posing at alumni functions and tourist attractions.\n\nThe moral of these people was clear to me: if you spend your life endlessly cruising around the world, never stopping to plant children on dry land, then when you die some Greek woman you don't even know will become the steward of your legacy. And when she wants more room in her house, she sells your legacy in the PennySaver. And no one wants it. I'd been waiting for the perfect movie title, but finally I decided to just name it. It had to be short, a very familiar, short word. I looked up the most commonly used nouns. The number one most common noun was time. Which made me feel less alone; everyone else was thinking about it too. Number two was person. Number three was year. Number 320 was future. The Future.\n\nI didn't set out planning to write a script about time, but the longer I took to write it and get it made, the more time became a protagonist in my life. At first my boyfriend and I thought we'd get married after our movies were made, but after about six months of trying to get the films financed we thought better of this plan and set a date, come what may. Nothing came, we got married. And then, right around the time I started blindly meeting PennySaver sellers, it began to dawn on me that not only was I now old enough to have a baby, I was almost old enough to be too old to have a baby. Five years left. Which is not very long if an independent movie takes at least one year to finance, one year to make, and throw in a year or two for unforeseen disasters. (And I couldn't make the movie while pregnant, even if I wanted to, because I was in it.)\n\nSo all my time was spent measuring time. While I listened to strangers and tried to patiently have faith in the unknown, I was also wondering how long this would take, and if any of it really mattered compared to having a baby. Word on the street was that it did not. Nothing mattered compared to having a baby. And now that I had vowed to hang out with this man until I died, I also thought a lot about dying. It seemed I had not only married him but also married my eventual death. Before the vows, I might have lived alone, but forever; now I would definitely not be alone and I would definitely die. I had agreed to die, in front of all my family and friends. Brigitte had taken a picture of the very moment: I was smiling and, understandably, crying.\n\n_Tomorrow: Miranda meets Joe, who is selling Christmas cards. _\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Jonathan Ledgard Believes Imagination Could Save the World\n\nIn a clearing in rural Somalia, a jihadi commander sat in a white plastic chair, stroking a dik-dik, an antelope the size of a cat. His men escorted two British journalists into the clearing and sat them under an acacia tree. The commander, who had offered safe passage and a rare interview, released the dik-dik, which scuttled off into the bush.\n\nDik-diks are hard to catch but easy to shoot, and for this reason one of the journalists, Jonathan Ledgard, who was the East Africa correspondent for The Economist , later described the battle against these jihadis, known as the Shabaab, as \"the dik-dik war.\" The commander began a lecture on the supremacy and fairness of Islamic law, jabbing his finger at the sky. But Ledgard barely noticed; he was looking at the array of mobile phones that the commander had laid out in front of him. It was 2009; the digital world was becoming enmeshed with the physical world, accessible in a place where the environment could hardly sustain human life. \"You could receive money through a wire transfer, but you could not keep your child alive,\" Ledgard later wrote. He realized that nothing the man had to say-nothing that anyone had to say about the conflict-was as essential to understanding the transformation under way in the region as the fact that the phones had perfect reception.\n\nFor fifteen years, Ledgard had been reporting on war and disaster in Latin America, the Balkans, Afghanistan, Central Asia, and Africa, while writing novels to settle his mind. He carried two notebooks-red for his reporting notes, blue for thoughts and observations to use in fiction. With each journalistic assignment he grew more interested in the contents of the blue notebooks, and less sure that reporting on the world's horrors did anything to change them. \"I had been looking at the world as if it were cracks in a pavement,\" Ledgard told me. \"But it's not about the individual cracks, it's about the patterns and the networks,\" the scale of which eluded the dispatch format.\n\nThe world was undergoing an accelerating convergence of technological and environmental trends-you could feel it in Nairobi, Kenya, where Ledgard lived. A little more than a century earlier, the city hadn't existed; now it had a population of millions, doubling in size every generation, and was home to perhaps the largest urban slum in Africa. \"The biggest risk for Africa is the unmet expectations of its youth,\" Ledgard wrote, years later. At least fifty per cent of the continent was less than twenty years old. It was the best-educated generation in African history, digitally connected to the rest of the planet, yet the World Bank estimated that seventy-five per cent of sub-Saharan youths would be unable to find a salaried job in the coming years. \"They will be easily knocked flat by mishaps or illnesses,\" Ledgard continued, and would be prone to recruitment into insurgencies and terrorist groups. It was no coincidence, he thought, that the jihad was most active in the areas already being ravaged by oil extraction and climate change.\n\nNew technologies were lifting a nascent class of entrepreneurs and activists, but also enabling predatory regimes to crush them. \" Africa rising \" was the phrase often heard at conferences in Geneva and New York; \"Africa wavering\" was Ledgard's view. Decades of humanitarian aid had not slowed the proliferation of refugee camps, or the surge of migrations across the desert and the sea. Meanwhile, the pace of human development was destroying the natural world faster than scientists could catalogue its systems, much less understand how they fit together. \"You don't have to be a C.I.A. analyst to realize that it doesn't add up,\" he said.\n\nLedgard saw a brief window for radical changes in sustainability and governance-a couple of decades, perhaps. After that, it seemed clear that no previous conflict or migration would compare to the hell to come. Feedback loops would be set in motion that would transform the earth into an irradiated planet. Already, humans are expected to force more than a million species into extinction , and, by 2050, to fill the oceans with a greater mass of plastic than there is of fish. In interviews, Ledgard started pressing politicians, consultants, businessmen-anyone with power-to devise strategies for a more equitable, sustainable future. \"But I just wasn't getting any answers,\" he told me.\n\nThe most exciting thinking about the near future was taking place on the fringes of the tech sector, among people who worked on networks and artificial intelligence. \"There is no room for techno-utopianism in our bare-fisted future,\" Ledgard wrote. But if there were a way to counter the scale and pace of human depredations, he thought, it would come out of the laboratories and companies whose creations were enabling it.\n\nIn 2012, Ledgard quit his job, moved to Switzerland, and began a fellowship at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, one of Europe's best research institutes. \"It was very important to me to be in an almost autistically scientific environment,\" he said-not \"hanging around with political scientists or economists or anthropologists and having the usual conversations, learning nothing.\" He pinned photographs of a Nokia 1100 and a Kalashnikov next to his desk, as reminders of why he was there.\n\nFor the first two years, Ledgard sat through hundreds of lectures by theoretical physicists, computer scientists, mathematicians, and engineers, and forced himself to read abstracts of scientific and philosophical papers on subjects that he could barely grasp. \"My brain started moving in these completely different and much richer directions,\" he said, sparking \"a series of progressive realizations that the world that I thought I understood is not at all the world as it is.\"\n\nIn time, Ledgard refashioned himself as both an evangelist of radical thinking and a prophet of specific doom. He won't tell you that the world is ending; he'll just present the charts that show you how. \"The only possible thing to do is to go in an imaginative direction,\" he told me. \"Imagination at scale is our only recourse.\" This approach has led him into collaborations with an array of famous partners-the British architect Norman Foster , the Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson -on projects that range from practical and humanitarian to fanciful and abstract. The world, according to Ledgard and his collaborators, might stand a chance if cargo drones delivered goods in the roadless areas of East Africa; if sentient robots were curious about the natural world; if people could immerse themselves in the sights and sounds of the deepest parts of the ocean; if plants and animals could pay people for the cost of their preservation. \"I'm not sure if this is a real project or I'm trying to write a novel in the natural world,\" Ledgard told me, referring to the last of these ideas.\n\nLedgard knows how fantastical his projects can sound. \"You have to acknowledge that the probability of success is vanishingly small,\" he said. \"But if just one of these ideas came off in the next twenty years, in some form, and in a really significant way-and it improved the lives of poor people, or helped save other life-forms from extinction-then that would be really worth your time.\" He added, \"My main point is to move the conversation in a more imaginative direction.\"\n\n\"You get visionaries, you get dreamers, but Jonathan is also a realist, and intensely practical,\" Norman Foster told me. \"Perhaps that's why there has been so much common ground between us. In the end, architecture is projecting imagination to realize a tangible project.\" Each of Ledgard's projects appears to be animated by a single question: What if human greed could be harnessed as a kind of natural resource, and redirected to mitigate its own effects?\n\nLedgard was born in the Shetland Islands, off Scotland, in 1968. His father was a military chaplain, and, when Ledgard was four, the family moved to a base in Germany. But he spent his teen-age summers in the Shetlands, and came to know a group of retired whalers there. They would \"sail to Antarctica, South Georgia, Montevideo, San Francisco, Cape Town, Valparaiso,\" he recalled. \"And then they'd come back. They were amazing, in that they had seen the world, but also they were so comfortable with not seeing the world. In a way, they were global citizens before globalization kicked into the jetliner age.\" Ever since, he said, \"I've always been someone who just longs to be everywhere and nowhere.\"\n\nSomewhere between boarding school in Somerset and journalism everywhere else, he lost his Scottish accent. He is married to a Czech diplomat named Marta Anna. Avvy, their Brittany spaniel, responds to commands in English, French, and Czech. So does their fourteen-year-old son, Hamish, who has attended schools in Nairobi, Lausanne, and Prague, and recently accompanied his father on a trip to Papua New Guinea, to look at dugong, vegetarian sea cows. (Ledgard has also helped bring up Marta Anna's three children from a previous marriage.)\n\nOne day in Lausanne, it occurred to Ledgard that \"we have no word to describe the volumetric space in the sky. What we see is what is on it, like stage scenery.\" In other words, \"the sky above Sudan is stacked with virtual Sudans\"-vast, empty, unused. Then came an epiphany: just as the arrival of mobile-phone networks had allowed Africa to avoid constructing expensive landlines, there might be a way to use this empty space to bypass the continent's paltry system of roads.\n\nMost roads in Africa were built by colonial powers, for the extraction of natural resources, and so they connect villages to capitals, and capitals to ports, and hardly take into account the desire of a community to trade over the next hill. Only half of the population live within a mile of a functional road. Deliveries of blood to rural health centers are slow and unreliable; refrigerated medicines go bad before they arrive.\n\nAn answer, Ledgard thought, was drones . Commercial drones can't carry payloads of more than a few pounds, but that will soon change. Ledgard worried more about designing the infrastructure for what he calls droneports, from which cargo drones could one day be charged, loaded, launched, and repaired. A disconnected fax machine is useless; as a node on a larger network of fax machines, however, it achieves something close to magic. \"It's got to work in a way that ordinary people can get some meaningful value from it in their own lives,\" he said.\n\n\"One thing to kill early on is this Silicon Valley idea of disruption,\" Ledgard went on. \"I don't want to disrupt everything. I just want to add new solutions. You need motorbikes. You need lorries. You need boats, you need cars, you need trains, you need planes. But maybe a fleet of flying robots is a good idea as well.\"\n\nLedgard started mapping out fifty-mile routes that would connect populated but remote areas in Rwanda, Uganda, and Tanzania. (He estimated fifty miles as the distance that a cargo drone could reliably travel on a single charge.) The droneports would begin operating in three stages, in the next decade. The first would provide deliveries of small quantities of blood, vaccines, and other urgent medicines. In stage two, droneports would make up a courier system to transport crucial documents and goods between government offices, mines, oil-and-gas installations, ranches, and conservancies. Then commercial droneports would begin to emerge, connecting industrial zones to city centers. From this, eventually, local economies could spring to life. \"Wherever you have impecunious young people ubiquitously connected to the internet, e-commerce is desperate to happen,\" Ledgard wrote in a concept manifesto.\n\nTo design the droneports, Ledgard reached out to Norman Foster, whom he had profiled for The Economist , and whose work includes the Apple Park, in Cupertino, and the Beijing airport. Foster is an accomplished pilot, and had been flying drones with his adolescent son in Central Park. \"You've designed the world's largest airports,\" Ledgard said to him, in 2013. \"Want to design the smallest?\"\n\nThe first droneport had to be uncomplicated and inexpensive, constructed with local materials, and able to withstand wild fluctuations between the rainy seasons and the dry. Foster also wanted it to be beautiful. He sketched an arched vault-strong, elegant, easily replicated. The renderings included a health clinic, a fabrication shop, a post office, a trading hub, and a garage for manufacturing and repairing drones, to insure that the droneport would \"become part of local community life,\" Foster wrote, in a design pitch for African governments, released through his charitable foundation.\n\nFoster began lecturing on the droneport concept at universities all over the world, and constructed a prototype at the Venice Biennale. Meanwhile, Ledgard returned to Central and East Africa, to solicit advice from politicians, entrepreneurs, bureaucrats, and local traders. One night, in northern Kenya, he tried to explain the concept to a Samburu elder. At first, the man struggled to conceive of an autonomous flying robot. But, after a few minutes, he leaned back and smiled, and said, \"I see! You want to put my donkey in the sky.\" Exactly, Ledgard replied. \"The qualities of a donkey are similar to what is required for a cargo drone: surefooted, dependable, intelligent, able to deal with dust and heat; cheap, uncomplaining.\"\n\nThe adoption of Ledgard's vision would require the backing of many of the same government officials who, in the aftermath of colonialism, had enriched themselves but failed to build functional roads. And so, for reasons that he recalled as \"pragmatic, really, and cynical,\" he decided to start with Rwanda. \"It's that I knew the President quite well,\" he said-another benefit of his journalistic past.\n\nPaul Kagame , whose band of rebel soldiers brought an end to the Rwandan genocide, became the country's President in 2000. Since then, he has distinguished himself in the region for his future-minded approach, with strong health and education sectors, and more women than men in the legislature. These policies have seduced international organizations and brought investors to Rwanda, even as his regime has detained street children and other \"undesirables,\" and his political opponents have wound up in prison or dead. In 2014, at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Ledgard suggested to Kagame that Rwanda could transform the perception of drones from that of flying robots that deliver missiles to one of flying robots that deliver lifesaving materials. Kagame embraced the idea, and two years later a Silicon Valley startup called Zipline began flying blood to health facilities in remote areas, as part of a governmental fleet.\n\nFor Ledgard, the result was mixed; a leader had acted on his idea, but he found it troubling that Zipline operated under Kagame's authority. \"It needs to be a civilian project, at its core,\" Ledgard told me. In nearby countries, young people came up with new applications for drone mapping and photography, but Ledgard struggled to get African leaders to adopt his droneport concept. \"I'm not a politician or a regulator, and I'm not an engineer or an entrepreneur,\" he said. \"It's up to them to test it in the real world, and scale it-if it makes sense.\"\n\nAnother obstacle lay in opening up fragile countries to new challenges in safety and security. In the Middle East, jihadi groups have attached explosives to commercial drones, and deployed them in swarms against their foes. \"You are opening your window to get fresh air,\" a Tanzanian aviation official said. \"But sometimes insects might come.\" Ledgard has stressed the importance of government protection for droneports, at a level somewhere between that of a post office and an airport. As for accidents, \"fear of drones falling out of the sky should be set against the carnage on African roads,\" he said. The continent has three per cent of the world's motor vehicles but accounts for eighteen per cent of the world's road deaths.\n\nSeveral years ago, Ledgard tried to organize an event called the Flying Donkey Challenge, in which drone manufacturers would compete to transport goods around the perimeter of Mt. Kenya, the second-tallest peak in Africa. The event was backed by the École Polytechnique and the Swiss government, and planned to include, Ledgard said, participants from Amazon, Alibaba, and DHL. But the threat of the Shabaab in Kenyan territory was growing, and Kenya's intelligence agency shut down the event. Soon afterward, the government issued a multiyear ban on commercial drones.\n\nOne afternoon last October, Ledgard stood at the edge of a disused railroad track in Mwanza, Tanzania's second-largest city, on the banks of Lake Victoria. To his left was Bismarck Rock, a striking geological formation named for Germany's first Chancellor. (From 1885 until the end of the First World War, Tanzania was part of German East Africa.) To Ledgard's right was a rusting ferry, which had been built in Scotland, then chopped up, exported to Kenya, and reassembled at the edge of the lake in 1961, when Tanzania was part of the British Empire. Nearby, women grilled fish and vegetables over open fires and shooed away marabou storks-hideous, ill-tempered carnivores with rotten bills and stringy, matted feathers.\n\nLedgard has the wiry, athletic build of a man who hates to be inside; outside, he bounds forward with eager steps, legs slightly bowed, shoulders hunched. He is mostly bald, with a rim of white stubble, and prone to sunburn. He inhaled deeply, and said, \"This was always the dream: to connect Lake Victoria.\" The largest freshwater body in Africa, Lake Victoria has more than four thousand miles of jagged shoreline, belonging to Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. Some thirty million people live in settlements on the periphery, in structures ranging from glass skyscrapers, in Kampala, to mud huts, on islands where there is no electricity. The lake is twice the size of Belgium, but it is overfished and filled with deadly parasites.\n\nThat night, on the lawn of a lakeside resort, Ledgard met with Edward Anderson, a senior technology and development specialist at the World Bank. In 2014, Anderson recalled, he had noticed \"an explosion in the variety and capability of small drones,\" at a time when most countries in Africa had no regulations. \"It was a bit of a Wild West scenario.\"\n\n\"Moving blood, moving medicine-it's a good start,\" Ledgard said. \"But the scaling is really going to kick into gear when it becomes cheap enough to move around everyday things.\" Battery technology hasn't advanced as quickly as Ledgard had thought it would, when he wrote his manifesto; five years later, cargo drones lack the power-to-weight ratio required to lift heavy loads.\n\nLink copied\n\nAnderson said that he'd just met a livestock geneticist who wanted to use drones to transport \"élite semen\" to cattle farms in remote areas in Kenya. \"Yes, he's all about artificial intelligence for artificial insemination,\" Ledgard replied. \"In the way that the Internet was lifted by porn, cargo drones will be lifted by khat,\" the stimulant leaf that's ubiquitous in parts of Africa and the Middle East.\n\nAnderson raised a glass of beer and slumped in his chair. He had first sought out Ledgard in 2016, \"to get his insight, advice, and, ideally, blessing on how to revive the Flying Donkey Challenge,\" he said. Now, after years of coördinating with Tanzanian officials, Anderson and his colleagues had organized the Lake Victoria Challenge, the world's first drone-infrastructure conference. Part lecture series, part sales pitch, it would bring together entrepreneurs and experts in development, regulation, governance, security, infrastructure, and technology from across Africa, as well as from Silicon Valley. Ledgard, its guiding spirit, would deliver the keynote address. Foreign drone companies would run their wares through a gantlet of trials, carrying objects between the mainland and nearby islands, in competition for contracts. \"Now that it's entering the real world, I think there are better people than me to push it to the next level,\" Ledgard told me. The full event was planned for the following year; a rehearsal would begin at dawn.\n\nI ate breakfast on a patio at the Hotel Tilapia, a few feet from the lake. Suddenly, there was a rush of air, and a hawk swooped down and snatched a crêpe off my plate. A few minutes later, another raptor relieved my fork of some bacon, halfway to my mouth, and flung scrambled eggs onto my pants. The assault brought sympathetic laughter from a group of Rwandan Civil Aviation Authority officials sitting nearby. Maréchal Gasana, an elegantly dressed regulations officer, gestured toward an empty chair. After Ledgard's meeting with Kagame, Gasana and his colleagues had drafted the first commercial-drone regulations on the continent, a model for other countries looking to \"leapfrog into the future,\" as he put it.\n\n\"It was very complicated, because we have so many mountains,\" Gasana told me. \"We have to make sure that drones are flying not just at the right altitude but in relation to the shape of the ground.\" Today, two drone companies are operational in Rwanda-Zipline, for medical deliveries, and Charis, a domestic company, for surveying land and tracking crop yields. \"The biggest challenge that we are facing is scalability,\" Gasana continued. \"We've seen all the benefits, but the question is, how can we manage thirty or fifty times as many operations?\"\n\nOn the lawn of the Malaika, Mwanza's grandest hotel, European and American drone manufacturers showed off their concept vehicles. In Rwanda, Zipline drones deliver blood packs, medicine, and vaccines as a one-way service; launched from a motorized slingshot, they travel to remote health facilities, drop a cardboard box tethered to a tiny parachute, and return to the launch area, where they are brought down with a wire trap. Their inability to land means that doctors at remote health centers cannot send back lab samples or biopsies. At the Malaika, the prototypes were largely V.T.O.L. drones-vertical takeoff and landing. Perhaps the most arresting one was the Wingcopter 178, a German contraption with a six-foot wingspan and a tilt-rotor mechanism that can transition between vertical takeoff and fixed-wing flight. Ansgar Kadura, a founder and the chief operating officer of Wingcopter, told me, \"We've already been here in Mwanza for six months,\" conducting test flights to an island called Ukerewe. By ferry and motorcycle, delivery from Mwanza to Ukerewe, around the perimeter of the lake, takes between four and six hours. The Wingcopter costs seventy-five thousand dollars, but it can transport a payload of up to thirteen pounds across the water in about forty minutes, soaring along a preprogrammed flight path, before rotating the propellers and lowering itself to the ground.\n\nKadura and members of the other drone teams had travelled to Mwanza in part to compete in a race from the Malaika to Juma , a small island without electricity about ten miles west. But the race was cancelled, because the hardware for the traffic-management system had been lost in transit from Amsterdam, and without it the Tanzanian authorities wouldn't allow drones to fly beyond the line of sight. The drone operators stood next to some of the most advanced nonmilitary aircraft on earth, while, at Mwanza's international airport, which had no radar system, air-traffic controllers peered out of a second-floor window to track incoming planes.\n\nBy now, it had become apparent that the legacy of colonialism affected every step of this process. Representatives of Western companies, N.G.O.s, and U.N. agencies-wary of criticizing African leaders in an environment imbued with historical exploitation and contemporary guilt-spoke of the absence of roads and other systems in East Africa as if the situation were in no way the responsibility of the officials in the room. Broken roads, no roads, sinking ferries, urban flooding, cholera; drones could photograph the problem, map it, deliver small items-as long as the governments didn't object.\n\nA Swiss construction expert noted, with an exasperated shrug, \"The supply chain for these drones is controlled by fancy Western companies, toting around carbon-fibre frames. And the international community will make them rich,\" pouring aid and development funds into flying machines that, for all their advantages, could put motorcycle deliverymen out of business. He added that only Ledgard and Foster's droneport concept was exempt from this critique, because it was conceived as an organic network, for locals to use as they saw fit. \"The last thing you want to do is disrupt the local motorcycle-delivery guy, picking up from the fixed droneport location and delivering on the last mile,\" Ledgard said. \"But the middle mile-when you want to get over a mountain or a lake-that's where it can get very exciting.\"\n\nMaréchal Gasana, the Rwandan regulatory official, also had cost in mind. \"In Italy, they have roads that are two thousand years old, built by the Romans, but we are trying to meet the needs of a population that has never had anything,\" he said. \"So if I am given the option of building one kilometre of road that will last two thousand years, or taking the Chinese contract that will build a thousand kilometres of road that will last five years, plus two hospitals, that's the offer we are going to take.\"\n\nA hawk stole another tourist's breakfast. Gasana was reminded of a video he had seen, in which a carbon-fibre V.T.O.L. drone falls out of the sky. \"It broke my heart,\" he said. \"I was thinking of it in terms of houses. In my village-seventy-five thousand dollars? That's two houses.\"\n\nThe next morning, the World Bank rented both of the speedboats in Mwanza to take a couple of dozen Lake Victoria Challenge participants, who had signed up for the conference's \"Infrastructure Track,\" to Juma Island. Guided by Ledgard, the group set out to identify a good location for a droneport, and to evaluate how it might contribute to the economy, which relies mostly on fishing. I sat in the back, in a growing puddle, with the Swiss construction expert and Steve Kemp, the livestock geneticist. \"Artificial insemination is ludicrously complex, cumbersome work!\" Kemp shouted, above the roar of the engines. \"If you want to do an insemination well, you've only got a few hours!\"\n\nThe boats pulled up to Juma's eastern shore, where L.V.C. representatives had set up fences and chairs and awnings. Islanders stood at the periphery. One of them held up a carp by its gills, and smiled, as visitors snapped photos with their phones. Ledgard, who had visited the island a year earlier, asked participants to be \"very gentle and respectful of everyone on the island,\" but it seemed an inherent violation for such a large delegation of mostly white strangers to wander around.\n\nWe set off through a lush grove of banana trees, past goats and chickens, into a village of mud-and-concrete huts, where Ledgard stepped into a tiny shop selling batteries, toiletries, snacks, and cheap plastic goods from China. With the help of Freddie Mbuya, a Tanzanian entrepreneur who helped organize the L.V.C., Ledgard started interviewing the shopkeeper, who was twenty years old. After several minutes, the man became agitated. \"What he is saying is being said repeatedly in places all over Tanzania, and I'm sure all over Africa,\" Mbuya explained. \"You guys came last time and you said that these drones will bring medicine. He hasn't seen any medicine. Now you're coming in and saying these drones are going to be bringing other things.\" He added that, because we had spent time inside his shop, his neighbors will ask him about the World Bank's plans for the island, and will assume that he's been paid. \"I think he's a hundred per cent right-we should be able to tell him why we're here,\" Mbuya continued. \"What can he go and tell the islanders?\"\n\n\"We're a group who are looking at building a small structure near the school and the clinic,\" Ledgard said. \"It will take some years. You have to be understanding that this is a new technology. It's not going to change anyone's life straightaway, but it can be a useful service.\"\n\nThe shopkeeper nodded but looked dissatisfied. \"It actually makes me extremely uncomfortable as a Tanzanian, because I think he's asking the right questions,\" Mbuya told me later. He used to be a full-time consultant for the World Bank, where he often found himself promising short-term solutions to intractable issues. \"If I were someone else, I would be slamming the person in my role, really hard,\" Mbuya said.\n\nBack at the staging area, the L.V.C. delegation ate boxed lunches while islanders watched from the other side of the fence. Then we piled into the boats and returned to Mwanza, to compare notes at the Malaika. No one from Juma was present for the discussion about how to connect the island to its own future.\n\nOn Juma, Ledgard had learned that fishermen sell a sardine-like fish called dagaa by the bucket, while the middlemen who transport and sell the fish to Mwanza sell them by the kilogram. The fishermen of Juma don't know the price per kilo, and couldn't tell him how many kilos were in a bucket, because they didn't have a scale. \"So, obviously, the droneport will need a weigh station,\" Ledgard said. \"What is going out is, essentially, fish. And what is coming in is cash, spare parts, postal delivery.\"\n\nA young Rwandan entrepreneur objected, saying, \"If you mentioned all that in the Rwandan context, the government would not allow you to do it. It is against the vision of the country. We are encouraging zero paperwork, zero cash-it's all mobile money, mobile banking.\" He added, \"When you are looking at earliest-use cases, you quickly want to run them through the strategic direction that the country has.\"\n\n\"You're too Rwandan,\" Ledgard replied. \"Tanzania does not have a strategic direction.\" For Ledgard, the fact that the L.V.C. trial had taken place was itself a miracle. For all its tonal and logistical challenges, he saw it as a potentially transformational event, whose effects might spread throughout the region as participants from neighboring countries returned home. But, months later, the Tanzanian government still hasn't set aside any land for the construction of a droneport, and has blocked the full L.V.C. event from taking place until at least 2021. \"The conversation with Mwanza is off, indefinitely,\" Anderson, of the World Bank, told me. \"We're relocating the next phase to Lake Kivu, in Rwanda.\"\n\nAt the Malaika, the Infrastructure Track group pondered heady questions. \"What is the role of architecture?\" an American architecture professor asked. \"What is the iconographic identity that we can achieve through some kind of performative structure? What are the values that we can chase?\"\n\n\"Design is the problem,\" another said.\n\nLink copied\n\n\"Maybe droneport is the wrong name.\"\n\n\"Maybe we can call it a 'drone place'?\"\n\nLedgard laughed-he and Foster had rigorously addressed these questions five years before, although he didn't point this out to the group. The hours ticked by. Someone proposed that the group name the droneport Mtego, because, he said, \"I learned today that it means 'net' in Swahili. And this will capture wealth, and it will be networked.\" A Spanish L.V.C. organizer wrote \" M-T-E-G-O \" on a whiteboard, in blue marker. In fact, mtego means \"trap.\"\n\nTwo days later, Ledgard and I left Mwanza for Nairobi, with a brief fuel stop at Kilimanjaro. From there, he would continue to Marseille, to consult with the theoretical physicist Carlo Rovelli on the shape and meaning of time, and then to Prague, where, for the past two years, Ledgard has served as a visiting professor at the Czech Technical University's Center on Artificial Intelligence. In transit, I reread \" Submergence ,\" Ledgard's second novel, which was published in 2011. It depicts a love affair between a deep-ocean biologist and a spy, but it's really Ledgard's attack on shortsighted politics and an ode to our sickly, fading earth. A favorable review in the Times called it \"obsessed with unexplored depths, whether of self, of world conflict or of the ocean.\" Kathryn Schulz, writing in New York , called it \"the best novel I've read so far this year,\" and compared Ledgard's prose to that of John le Carré, Anne Carson, and W. G. Sebald.\n\nIn the book, James More, a British intelligence officer who lives in Kenya, is Ledgard the reporter, a man who has \"a flaw in him that urged him to catalogue rather than to enjoy,\" Ledgard writes. \"He was tasking agents to infiltrate mosques in Somalia and along the Swahili coast,\" places where you could work out how many people lived in a settlement by the number of plastic bags on the trees. Danielle Flinders, the biologist, is Ledgard today: \"She was trying to understand the pullulating life in the dark parts of the planet at a time when, up above, mankind was itself becoming a swarm and setting off in ever more artfully constructed but smaller and more mindless circles.\"\n\nJames is captured by jihadis in Somalia, and faces execution-but it is Danielle who puts into perspective the fragility of life itself. \"We exist only as a film on the water,\" she explains. Life on earth began in the deep, and the search for extraterrestrial life continues in the oceans of distant moons. \"We're nature's brief experiment with self-awareness,\" she says. \"Any study of the ocean and what lies beneath it should serve notice of how easily the planet might shrug us off.\"\n\nSince \"Submergence\" came out, Ledgard has been working with Olafur Eliasson to broadcast the sights and sounds of the deep ocean in a gallery, to show that \"there is another world in our world,\" which is vast and fragile, and largely unknown. As we drove through Nairobi, during a layover, Ledgard gestured in the direction of the Great Rift Valley, the site of many of the oldest known human remains. \"Early humans walked out of that place seventy thousand, maybe eighty thousand years ago-an incredibly short period of time, compared to microbial life,\" he said. Now we're choking the planet.\n\nAccording to a United Nations study, humans have \" severely altered \" two-thirds of the earth's marine environment. Each decade, we lose ten per cent of the world's sea-grass meadows and dump some four billion tons of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge, and other industrial wastes into the world's waters. \"If this was happening in a science-fiction world we would see it clearly for what it is, but we don't because it's happening here and now. It's obscured by the money someone is making off it,\" Danielle says. \"If man had a sense of proportion, he would die of shame.\"\n\nIn Czech, the phrase jdi do Prčice literally means \"go to Prčice,\" but it is widely understood as an affectionate way of saying \"get lost\" or \"go fuck yourself.\" Ledgard, who has a weekend house near Prčice, says he does much of his best thinking on walks in the Czech countryside, and it was on one of his outings, last year, that he had \"a eureka moment.\" Many of the planet's biodiversity-rich areas happen to be in cash-poor places. What if endangered species could, in effect, pay local communities for their own protection? Might it be possible to store value in a pear tree in Tajikistan, or in a chimpanzee in Uganda's Albertine Rift?\n\nLast November, in Prague, he presented this idea at Avast, an artificial-intelligence and cybersecurity firm, before Ondrej Vlcek, the C.E.O., and a team of computer scientists. \"Many species are at risk of local extinction because they have no independent means to change their financial value,\" Ledgard explained. The goal, he said, is to \"pick a local species that is threatened with extinction, give it some financial agency in the world, and then work out how the value that it holds can be distributed to the local human community.\" He named the project Linnaeus, for the Swedish botanist who devised the taxonomic system.\n\n\"Why not kill the animal when you're hungry?\" an engineer asked.\n\n\"Essentially, what you want is for these communities to start realizing that they have significant, positive financial value from living next to a biodiverse area,\" Ledgard replied. \"But to do that you would have to provide more value than they're presently getting from short-term, day-to-day activities, like cutting down trees for charcoal,\" or killing gorillas for meat. If Linnaeus were implemented, he explained, \"very large numbers of humans would give small amounts of money into a mechanism which then apportions it hyperlocally, to species that need it most\"; as an endangered population grew in health and number, so, too, would the amount of money distributed to the local human community.\n\n\"It's crazy, but it might work,\" an Avast employee said.\n\n\"How committed are you, personally, to this?\" Vlcek, the C.E.O., asked.\n\n\"Oh, a hundred per cent!\"\n\n\"So this is all you're doing?\"\n\n\"Well, eighty per cent,\" Ledgard replied. \"My modus operandi is to think of crazy ideas, and then to try to lift them, in a very early stage.\"\n\n\"A number of crazy ideas? Because this one is crazy enough to keep you busy for many years,\" Vlcek said. \"What's in it for you? Why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"I don't want to get to 2050, when Elon Musk and his libertarian chums are eating dog food on Mars, and then for them to look back on Earth and see that we've lost fifty per cent of our life-forms,\" Ledgard replied. \"There's a significant minority-or maybe a majority-of human beings who are biophiliac. They like living things. And that hasn't been priced correctly.\"\n\nA few months later, Ledgard called me to say that he had refined the concept to focus on the promotion of insect life on European farms. \"Jonathan, like all of us-his greatest strength is also, paradoxically, his weakness,\" Foster told me. \"And that is his ability to go from one great idea to another, and to another, and to another.\"\n\nIn recent years, Ledgard's fixations have converged in the field of artificial intelligence. No other technological development is likely to so dramatically accelerate the future, especially if computer scientists achieve what is known as \"singularity\"-the point at which an artificially intelligent network escapes human control. Some futurists worry about robots taking over; Ledgard is more concerned that artificial intelligence is being crafted in the image of the modern corporate élite, obsessed with the generation of capital and uninterested in the natural world. \"If you're not recorded in the book of data, then you cease to have importance,\" Ledgard explained.\n\nAlready, humans have accelerated the rate of global species extinction by a factor of \"tens or hundreds of times\" more than in the previous ten million years, according to the United Nations. The biologist and theorist Edward O. Wilson writes, in \" Half Earth: Our Planet's Fight for Life ,\" from 2016, \"Humanity is losing the race between the scientific study of global biodiversity and the obliteration of countless still unknown species.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nYet the studies that have been carried out make it clear that, in both the digital and the natural realms, \"there are ways of seeing and ways of understanding which are superior to the ways that humans see and understand,\" Ledgard said. Wilson writes in another of his books, \" Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge ,\" from 1998, that \"we have even uncovered basic senses entirely outside the human repertory. Where humans detect electricity only indirectly by a tingling of skin or flash of light, the electric fishes of Africa and South America\" transmit and receive electrical signals through their skin. Butterflies search for pollen by reading the pattern of ultraviolet rays that are reflected off petals; bats hunt by broadcasting ultrasonic pulses and reading the echoes that bounce off the bodies of insects.\n\n\"If you look intensely at something, it becomes magical, it attains an importance and a character,\" Ledgard said. A superintelligent digital entity would be able to look more intensely at everything, and so it might develop a greater awe of the intricacies of the natural world. But it might also miss the mark, morally. As the Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom wrote, in his 2003 paper \" Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence ,\" it \"seems perfectly possible to have a superintelligence whose sole goal is something completely arbitrary, such as to manufacture as many paperclips as possible, and who would resist with all its might any attempt to alter this goal.\" Or, if the Internet had its way, the superintelligent entity might be taught to prioritize the existence of cute animals, like mice-which falcons eat-and thus bring about extinction for falcons. \"We need to be careful about what we wish for from a superintelligence, because we might get it,\" Bostrom writes.\n\nLast year, Ledgard teamed up with Federico Díaz, a Czech-Argentine conceptual artist, to imagine how an artificially intelligent robot would conceive of the natural world around it. On a long walk, about fifteen miles outside Prague, they spotted a wild boar tearing through a farmer's field. It struck Ledgard that this ugly, stinking beast is exactly the kind of creature that might be left out of the digital future. \"Wild boar live very proximate to humans, but no one really thinks about them much, except to kill them,\" Ledgard said between slurps of pea soup, when we met in Prague. He and Díaz started tracking a group of boar, sleeping in a field among them. They learned that wild boar dig circular pits in the ground. \"Fedé is a very romantic guy-he had this idea that the boar were looking for something existential,\" Ledgard told me. \"This wafting smell of the earth, this energy-that they're looking out to the stars and digging around. Then we spoke to the gamekeeper, and he said, 'What? No, they're in it for meat. They want worms and mice.' \"\n\nLedgard and Díaz intend to create an immersive art exhibit where visitors would become disoriented by shifting perspectives-between that of the boar and that of the machine intelligence-and begin to question the human tendency to rely on visual sight over the other senses. To Ledgard, collaboration with artists is as urgent as that with scientists. \"The questions that various artists have been asking-maybe forever!-are really fundamental questions, which machine-intelligence engineers are only just beginning to ask themselves,\" he said. \"What is it to have a body? What is it to have a sense of touch? How are you orientated in space?\" Ledgard and Díaz concede the impossibility of the task at hand. \"We know something about boars through videos and books, hunters and zoologists,\" Díaz said. \"But I am like a child-I know nothing about the language of the boars. And then, if we are talking about A.I., we are in prenatal times.\"\n\n\"We are two humans trying to imagine what is a boar, and what is machine intelligence, and how would they think about each other,\" Ledgard said. The theme echoes Ledgard's first novel, \" Giraffe ,\" from 2006, which is partly written from the perspective of a Kenyan giraffe, which ends up being killed in Czechoslovak captivity during the Soviet era. \"We know that what we are doing is stupid and forlorn. But we also know that it's important and beautiful.\"\n\nDíaz objected: \"I wouldn't say stupid, I would say naïve.\"\n\n\"Naïve-better word,\" Ledgard agreed. \"It's this idea that maybe-and weirdly-in 2060 the machine intelligence will look back and say, 'Oh, this was one of the first very, very clumsy, naïve attempts to think of what I might think about!' \"\n\nThat night, Ledgard and I drove a half hour southwest, to a village called Mezouň. It was nine o'clock, and Díaz had arranged for a local hunter, a large, middle-aged Czech named Martin, to lead us into the woods.\n\nMartin parked at the edge of a small field, thick with weeds. It was surrounded by forest but close enough to the highway that you could hear the sounds of passing cars. \"When we started this project, we were trying to escape the human element,\" Ledgard said. \"But we've come to really appreciate that humans have meshed the entire world. Here is an animal that lives around us. It's not domestic, but it's not truly wild, either.\" Against the night sky-which showed the lights in Prague-you could make out the black silhouette of a wooden hunting tower.\n\n\"There is a group of thirty to forty boar that lives in this patch of forest,\" Martin explained. He gestured toward the tower, adding, \"I killed one this morning, at seven o'clock.\" Then he climbed into his truck and drove off.\n\nDead leaves and acorns tumbled through the crisp autumn air. Ledgard and Díaz climbed the hunting tower, but after a few minutes Díaz insisted that they leave. \"I think we will not see anything, because we are in the spot of the shooter,\" he said, and the boar would be mourning Martin's kill.\n\nLedgard got down, and began traipsing through the forest, leaving Díaz behind. He came across muddy pits where the boar had foraged for mice and acorns, and parts of trees whose bark had been rubbed off by boar. \"Boy, that's a strong smell,\" he said. \"Sweat, berries, mice, rotting acorns, shit.\"\n\nThere was the yellow glint of an eye, roughly forty feet away. A large female boar stared at Ledgard for a few seconds, then turned, snuffling, and darted off. After a few minutes of silence, at least a dozen boar rustled past, very close, hidden amid the darkness and the trees. \"If you see them, it's about you,\" Ledgard whispered. \"But if you can just smell and hear them it's about them.\"\n\nThis was quintessential Ledgard: inquisitive, strange, striving for stillness and invisibility-the better to spend time among aggressive and skittish creatures, and make sense of them to a mostly incurious world. I had come to think of him as a man who probably won't save the planet but at least has the audacity to try.\n\nLedgard and I returned to the car close to midnight. We were covered to the ankles with boar droppings. We drove with the windows down, and stopped at a gas station, on the outskirts of Prague, where we took turns blasting our feet with a power washer. \"The closer you get, the harder you try to see the boar as a creature, the more you realize that you don't have the empathy to do so,\" Ledgard said, laughing.\n\nIn his darkest moments, Ledgard has the \"somewhat creepy\" fantasy that advances in artificial intelligence may actually serve as a kind of evolutionary correction to the depredations of humanity. The best hope for the natural world might look something like Nick Bostrom's paper-clip problem, but morally intact: that before we render the earth completely uninhabitable we will create a superintelligent entity that recognizes the value of life itself, and so begins to ruthlessly prioritize the preservation of life in its most essential forms-the microbes, the fungi, the flora, the jellies and salps pulsing in the oceans' blackest deep. A digital intervention to mitigate the Anthropocene. Another chance for earth, without us. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this story misidentified the location of the boarding school Ledgard attended.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Deep East Texas\n\nI went to see Roger Hale mainly because of my interest in the case that put him in jail. Hale, who is forty-seven years old, black, and a total stranger to all forms of American privilege, is serving twelve years in a federal prison in Louisiana after pleading guilty to distributing cocaine. He was born and raised in San Augustine County, in the piney-woods country known as Deep East Texas. I was spending a lot of time in San Augustine, and that was another reason I went to see him: he was related to a lot of people I got to know. His wife, for instance, a soft-voiced young woman known as Fanny, waitresses at the Hill Top Barbecue, a family-run joint where I often ate lunch. When Fanny heard that I was going to visit her husband, she sent the same message that one of his cousins did: \"Just tell Roger we love him.\"\n\nThe case was known as Operation White Tornado. It had been a combined effort by federal, state, and local law-enforcement officers to shut down a cocaine-trafficking network based in San Augustine County. Some two hundred agents had descended on San Augustine on June 2, 1989, and arrested dozens of residents, including Hale. A crowd gathered in the courthouse square in the town of San Augustine that night and cheered as handcuffed suspects were led into the squat old jail. At a press conference the next day, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas announced that the local drug trade had been \"what you would expect to find in a major metropolitan area.\" Seventy-five pounds of cocaine-with a street value of more than three million dollars-had been moving through San Augustine each week, he said.\n\nThis was startling news, if only because San Augustine is, even by East Texas standards, poor, isolated, and sparsely populated. The county, which is half the size of Rhode Island, has only eight thousand inhabitants, thirty-five per cent of whom live below the federal poverty line. Though it is on no interstate highway, and is about eighty miles from a town of any size, San Augustine had somehow become, according to the authorities, a major regional distribution center for cocaine. I wanted to know how that had happened, and also how such a small, close-knit community had absorbed the impact of an Operation White Tornado. (Some people called it Operation Black Tornado, for of fifty-four people ultimately convicted on various charges fifty were black. San Augustine County is thirty per cent black.) Clearly, some combination of drugs and the national \"war on drugs\" had rocked the county to its foundations.\n\nRoger Hale, according to the police, was actually a minor figure in the San Augustine drug trade. But when we met, in an empty prison visiting room, he came on like a tough guy. In a harsh, level voice, he told extravagant stories of wheeling and dealing in guns and jewelry-but not drugs-and made extravagant threats against people in San Augustine who he felt had sold him down the river. His standard pronouncement on his enemies was \"He's no earthly good, and he knows I know it.\" He himself had never really done anything wrong-\"just devilment,\" he said-but he had become unpopular as a result of his work as a repo man (work that had required him to carry a sawed-off shotgun) and his involvement in what he called \"politics.\" Hale's social philosophy might also have hurt his popularity, I thought. \"People who had less than me, I never messed with 'em, because I couldn't make nothing off 'em,\" he said. \"I never had much time for black people. I mostly associated with up-to-date white people.\"\n\nHale believed that he was in prison solely because of his association with Nathan Tindall, a not especially up-to-date white person who had been the sheriff of San Augustine County for the better part of forty years. Hale had worked, in various capacities, for Mr. Nathan, as he called him, his entire adult life. Indeed, people in San Augustine still described Hale as \"Nathan's hey-boy,\" a nasty little tag that Hale may have had in mind when he informed me vehemently, \"I'm my own man. I ain't no boy.\"\n\nNathan Tindall was, according to many accounts, the chief target of Operation White Tornado. He had left the sheriff's office just a few months before the raid, after losing the last election, and federal indictments had fallen all around him. Roger Hale went to prison on drug charges, and so did Hale's two grown sons. Willie Earl Dade, Tindall's last chief deputy, was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Dave Husband, a local liquor wholesaler and a longtime friend and political ally of Tindall's, was one of the white defendants in the case. Roger Hale said, \"Me and the white boy, we got the hard time just because we wouldn't give them the Sheriff.\" By \"the white boy\" he meant Husband, and in Husband's case he was certainly right. Although Husband had coöperated by pleading guilty to drug, gun, and tax charges-and no drugs had been found on his property, and he had no prior felony convictions, and none of the crimes he was charged with involved any violence-he had, after refusing to incriminate Tindall, been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. This extraordinary sentence was one of the things that particularly interested me about Operation White Tornado. I also wondered, naturally, how it was that Tindall had escaped indictment.\n\nHale didn't really tell me much on that score. He could have tried to incriminate Tindall to curry favor with the feds, of course. \"But I didn't want to be that kind of fella,\" he said. He did know some explosive things, he insisted. \"And I'm about ready to call somebody, bring down that whole town like the Titanic.\" But he apparently wasn't ready to sink any ships through me.\n\nListening to Hale, trying to sort out the possibly true from the wildly improbable, I found myself wondering what kind of fella he in fact was. His peculiar fury, his stiff-necked hustler's dignity (which made it impossible to relay the simple news from home: that his family loved him) struck me as the likely product of a dismal mismatch-a bitter gap between his ambitions and his lot. I remembered his cousin, a beautiful church-choir singer and school-bus driver, with dark skin, narrow eyes, and strongly planed features that were just like Hale's, saying, \"Roger got the brains, he just don't have the-mm, background.\" And Hale, even from the depths of his crushing prison sentence, kept returning, I noticed, to the prospects and requirements of various business enterprises-trucking companies, gaming rooms-and discussed them with great energy. Some huge percentage of black men in Deep East Texas struggle to make a living \"hauling pulpwood\" (a dangerous, low-overhead form of logging), and Hale himself had worked for many years in the woods. But his heart, I suspected, was in the office, the bank, the auto dealership. When I asked about the drug raid's community impact, he fairly snarled, \"Operation White Tornado just put every black man with any business talent in San Augustine in prison.\"\n\nEast Texas resembles the Deep South far more than it does the open prairies of the rest of Texas. Dense pine and hardwood forests shroud rolling terrain; lakes and bayous are fed by fifty inches of rain a year. San Augustine was first settled by white farmers and their black slaves migrating west at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Their cotton plantations thrived in the red lands that run in a wide, fertile band across the county. The town, laid out in 1832, is, in the words of a road sign today, \"The Oldest Anglo Town in Texas.\" Several of the leaders of the Texas Republic came from San Augustine; Sam Houston himself lived there in the eighteen-thirties.\n\nWhite San Augustine, like much of the white South, never recovered from the Civil War. There were, in fact, more people living in the county in 1900 than there are today. As a result, San Augustine teems with ghosts, particularly in the woods, where innumerable small family graveyards lie overgrown. The slavery era left an indelible print on the county: surprising numbers of people, black and white, share the same few family names. These biracial clans were created when former slaves took the names of their owners after emancipation, causing those cruel original re-lationships to echo down through the ages.\n\nLike the rest of the \"black belt\" of the rural South (places with populations at least thirty per cent black), San Augustine after the Civil War settled into a general poverty, endured by all but a small élite. Sharecropping, which lasted nearly a century, perpetuated the old master-servant relations between certain black and white families, and Jim Crow laws and the Ku Klux Klan helped maintain social and economic distinctions between black and white small farmers. The great tide of American industrial prosperity bypassed the region as a whole. Timber eventually replaced cotton-wood remains the county's leading crop-and poultry farming came along after the Second World War, but the big timber mills and chicken-processing plants were all built elsewhere. There are poorer counties in East Texas, but San Augustine is today a backwater even in a backward, isolated area.\n\nMost Texans simply disown the whole region. \"Behind the Pine Curtain\" is what they call East Texas. Why, the people there aren't really even Texans, I was once told in Houston; they're the ones who were afraid to come out of the woods and into the sunlight during the great westward movement.\n\nAnd much about San Augustine does feel frozen in time, preserved from another era. Not only the plantation houses-slave-built from virgin longleaf pine-but many of the older houses in town have the wide porches and twelve-light windows, the fluted Doric columns and classical pediments of the antebellum South. On the courthouse square, farmers sell watermelons, okra, potatoes, and yellow squash from pickups parked next to the jail. Bags of seed are piled on a canopied sidewalk in front of an old brick hardware store. The only stoplight in town-and San Augustine is the only real town in the county-blinks sleepily, often seeing no traffic, at one corner of the square. Across the railroad tracks, in a black neighborhood still known as the Quarters, unpainted shotgun shacks lean under tall pines and great, spreading maples. On the porches in the Quarters, old folks nod in weathered armchairs; in the back yards, roosters crow from woodpiles. The atmosphere of deep, premodern slumber is broken only by the passing of a glistening violet Nissan miniature pickup, its side windows smoked, its chassis lowered almost to the ground, with a gold-flaked stiff chain around the license plate, a young black man at the wheel, and percussive hip-hop pounding from the cab.\n\nThough a big stone courthouse sits at the center of the square that occupies the center of downtown San Augustine, the old two-story brick jailhouse next door takes up far more symbolic space in the county's collective consciousness. People talk about \"the sheriff\"-or \"the high sheriff\"-whose office is in the jailhouse, as though he were an intimate, fundamental, inescapable fact of life, like oxygen or aging or family. They dream about him, turn to him in every sort of extremity, blame him for every sort of distress. More than once, I overheard residents in their cups declaring that their lives would be utterly different if only So-and-So were sheriff. The sheriff is held accountable not just for law enforcement but for the community's moral and economic health. He sets a tone, he defines an era. Presidents are marginal figures by comparison.\n\nPolitically, the South became a one-party state after Reconstruction, and in the system of power and patronage that emerged in virtually all rural areas violence was never far from the surface. In the eighteen-nineties, the Populists briefly challenged the ruling Democrats, and in San Augustine they managed to capture the sheriff's office. The first Populist sheriff of San Augustine was gunned down in the street in 1900 by a political rival. A few weeks later, his successor, who also happened to be his nephew, was shot, and two other nephews were killed, in a downtown shootout with leading Democrats. This particular political feud, which was also a clan feud, led to a number of other deaths. Soon, though, the Democrats were back in control of the county, and they have not been seriously challenged since.\n\nThe saloons where much of this frontier-style violence found its spark were closed by Prohibition, which came to Texas in 1918. But the illegal-liquor business thrived in perennially depressed, lightly policed San Augustine, and this trade, too, gave rise to frequent violent disputes. Like most Bible Belt communities, the county stayed dry after the repeal of national Prohibition, and thus insured that moonshining and bootlegging would continue. The families who controlled the liquor trade began to terrorize their neighbors, going on a legendary binge of robbery, rape, assault, and murder, until finally, in 1935, the Texas Rangers were sent in. The state officers took control of local law enforcement, forcing out the sheriff and bringing the outlaw clans to justice. Four thousand people gathered on the courthouse square to thank the Rangers. Still, moonshining and bootlegging remained important local industries in an economy that otherwise, during the Depression, virtually came to a halt.\n\nNathan Tindall grew up in Depression San Augustine. His parents were poor tenant farmers on the Attoyac River, in the western part of the county. He went to school in a lumber-company settlement and rarely saw the town of San Augustine. His family belonged to either Pentecostal or Baptist country churches; they and their neighbors moved in a separate social universe from the Episcopalians and the Methodists who worshipped in the big white churches in town. As a teen-ager, Tindall became a mule skinner-an independent logger with a mule team-and earned a name for himself as a hard worker blessed with extraordinary strength. \"For a white man, Nathan was almighty stout,\" a veterinarian named Tom Blount told me. \"He could pick up a hundred-and-twenty-eight-pound sack of oats with his teeth and throw it up on the back of a truck.\"\n\nIn 1943, at the age of eighteen, Tindall joined the Navy. He served in the Pacific, as a military policeman, and was wounded near Kwajalein. When he came home to San Augustine after the war, one of the first things he did was run for sheriff. It was an unusual move for a twenty-one-year-old, but Tindall was an unusual twenty-one-year-old. \"Hell, I was just as settled at twenty-one as I am now,\" the sixty-nine-year-old Tindall told me. \"I grew up young, for some reason, and never did change.\"\n\n\"Nathan was strangely even-tempered,\" Dr. Blount recalled. \"Almost unnaturally so. Also, there wasn't a scared bone in him.\"\n\nGreatly aided by the general popularity of returning soldiers, he was elected. A photograph of the young sheriff, taken in 1950, shows a smooth-cheeked, round-faced, blue-eyed country boy in a tall white Stetson. He looks kindly and calm, almost shy. Studying the photograph, Tindall-now portly, gray-haired, nearsighted, and nothing like shy-remarked to me thoughtfully, \"I don't believe I'd vote for a kid that young.\"\n\nHis new job paid only forty-five hundred dollars a year, but with it came a late-model, cream-colored Ford with a red light mounted in the center of the grille, and Tindall soon found that sheriffing suited him down to the ground. He knew the woods, where most of the county's moonshining and bootlegging went on, and he was willing to go to considerable lengths to do his job. \"One time, I knew this old boy down there in Black Ankle was makin' whiskey,\" he recalled. \"But I just didn't know where, and one day I seen he had a jenny, and I knew she was for carryin' the corn into the woods, because makin' that whiskey takes a lot of corn. So I seen he wasn't around, and I let the jenny out of her pen, and she took off into the woods. And I just grabbed onto her tail and followed her through the woods for about five miles. Finally, we came up to where the old boy had his rig, and he looked up, but he just saw the jenny, because I was down low right behind her. And when we got there and I popped up he went crazy. Cryin', prayin', screamin'. Wanted to kill hisself, wanted to kill that poor old jenny. But she didn't do nothin' wrong. Boy just didn't want to go to jail.\"\n\nTindall didn't attempt the impossible-shutting down the illegal-liquor trade. He simply kept enough pressure on the bootleggers and moonshiners to insure that their power didn't get out of hand, and kept the county's bank account filled with the fines he collected from them. The bootleggers' lawyers, notably Smith Ramsey and his brother Ben, were formidable opponents. The Ramseys were members of the old, landed élite of San Augustine-Ben served as lieutenant governor of Texas in the fifties, and Smith was routinely described as the most powerful man in town. Tindall, who never did win the support of most of the San Augustine Old Guard, had to work around them. \"One time, I waited till Smith was on vacation and Ben was busy in Austin,\" he recalled. \"And then I rounded up twenty-eight bootleggers, and I persuaded that judge, who usually did whatever Smith told him to do, to hit those boys with the maximum fine, a thousand dollars each. I could run the sheriff's office for five years in them days on twenty-eight thousand dollars.\"\n\nAlthough Tindall's annual budget was minuscule, he took pride in leaving most of it unspent. He was loath to renovate the jailhouse, which badly needed work, and he went to great lengths to process prisoners swiftly, so that the county wouldn't have to feed them. \"We had county court on Monday afternoons,\" Carol Vaughn, the county treasurer, told me. \"So if Nathan arrested somebody on a Monday evening, he'd just arraign them any way he could. Anything to avoid holding them for a week. He'd let them go and tell them to come back Monday, or else call the judge, get the person's attorney, if they had one, down there, and do it right in the sheriff's office.\"\n\nTindall even found a way to make money off his jailhouse-by taking overflow prisoners from crowded urban jails in Beaumont and Houston. One winter, the big-city inmates protested their primitive lodgings by tearing up their cells, and so Tindall housed them outdoors, cuffed to a flagpole on the courthouse square (it was sleeting, he recalled), while the cells were slowly cleaned.\n\n\"Nathan was very penny-pinching,\" Charles Mitchell, the San Augustine district attorney, said. \"And it could cause problems. Once, he tried to save the county money by not having an autopsy in a triple murder. He figured that it was self-enclosed-that the killer was one of the dead people-and I'm sure he was right. But what if some kids come in later and say there was a shooter in a tree?\" Tindall's official parsimony also gave rise to some strange personal habits. \"He always wrote a 'T' on the plastic-foam cup he used for coffee,\" Mitchell said. \"And he'd use the same cup for five days.\"\n\nBut when it came to solving crimes Tindall's approach was, according to him and to others as well, tenacious and inventive. \"I'd do about anything to catch a thug,\" he told me. \"I remember, once, this old boy had murdered his mother-in-law, and I knew how these boys always like to talk about what they done, so I saw them all in there one night, and I crawled up under the house, where I could hear them clear as could be. And here was this old boy tellin' them others, 'Don't tell the sheriff this, and don't tell the sheriff that.' After a few minutes, I heard pretty much everything I needed to know.\"\n\nCharles Mitchell, who happens to be Smith Ramsey's nephew, grew up in San Augustine in the nineteen-sixties. \"You couldn't do a thing here without the Sheriff knowing about it,\" Mitchell told me. \"He just pretty well handled it. One thing you have to say for Nathan: he is good at solving crimes.\"\n\nGary Borders, who edited a newspaper in San Augustine for five years in the nineteen-eighties, recalled, \"Tindall's judgments were very hard to second-guess. They were, you could say, uncannily canny.\"\n\nTindall's wits were his main weapon, literally. In a county where virtually everyone seems to carry a gun-where grandmothers pat their aprons significantly when the subject is small pistols and self-defense, where people still hunt deer and squirrel and possum for meat irrespective of the season, and where I was regarded with disbelief and disdain by local young women after admitting that I travelled unarmed-Tindall never carried a gun.\n\n\"He's a six-gun sheriff without the six-gun,\" said Sam Malone, a local printer and longtime East Texas newspaperman.\n\n\"He was always such a disappointment to me and the kids,\" I was told by Nathan's wife, Willie Earl Tindall, who is a schoolteacher and local historian. \"He didn't wear a gun, and you know how he made an arrest? He'd call them on the telephone and tell them to meet him at the jailhouse.\"\n\nTindall even made murder arrests over the telephone-perhaps fifty of them, he reckons, through the years. But his best-known exploits tended to feature his strangely even temper. I talked to several survivors of a standoff with a local man who killed his girlfriend and then barricaded himself inside a house, from which he shot a sheriff, a deputy sheriff, an ambulance driver, and a highway patrolman-the sheriff and the deputy each lost an eye-before Tindall showed up and, unarmed, strode up to the house. \"This is Tindall,\" he is reported to have said. \"Come on out of there.\" The man came out and laid his shotgun on the porch, and Tindall took him to jail.\n\nTindall's peculiar authority is difficult to account for, according to Sam Malone. \"He tells you to do something, you just better do it. Not because he'll hurt you physically, or even throw you in jail. He's just a queer nut. There ain't no explaining him.\"\n\nOccasionally, some drunk or foolish miscreant did compel Tindall to use force. \"He had a famously effective knockout punch,\" Gary Borders said. \"But he used it sparingly. And, as far as I could see, he did it without any relish. Tindall never used more force than was necessary to take a suspect into custody, and he used to brag that he never charged anyone with resisting arrest.\"\n\nTindall, being a politician, loved to get his picture in the paper. \"Nathan was always showing off,\" Borders went on to say. \"He once called me up to go out with him. He had solved the Case of the Stolen High School Band Instruments. We went out there, and the band instruments were right where he said they would be. He went on and on about his own brilliance, as if he had just solved the crime of the century. Finally, I managed to ask how he had come to suspect the boy who did it. The boy's mother had called him up, Nathan said, and told him that her son stole the stuff.\"\n\nIn truth, solving crimes and making arrests are not the major part of a rural sheriff's job. \"Mainly, the sheriff in a county like San Augustine has to know the people, and how to get their problems solved,\" a state-police sergeant told me. \"If two guys got a beef, he might just throw them both in a cell and let 'em fight it out. Or maybe run one guy out of the county.\" Character judgments, in other words, count for at least as much as crime judgments. As an example of Tindall's non-crime judgment, Charles Mitchell recalled a case in which the young son of a local drug addict won a twelve-thousand-dollar settlement after a car accident. Tindall gently suggested that the money be put in a trust, and, to everyone's astonishment, the addict mother agreed to that arrangement.\n\nIn the end, the rural sheriff, for all his autonomy and local power, is in a service profession, and the parameters of his job description have a tendency to expand indefinitely. \"In San Augustine, if you're out of water, the sheriff's supposed to bring you water,\" Willie Earl Tindall said. \"If your car breaks down, the sheriff's supposed to carry you home. If your lights go out, and you can't get the electric company, it's the sheriff's job to bring you a flashlight. It's pathetic, but that's the way people think here.\"\n\nTindall took this \"political\" side of his job so seriously that he essentially put himself on twenty-four-hour call for forty years. His nights off were so short that he often slept in his office. He and Willie Earl were married in the jailhouse, with two deputies as witnesses and with Nathan wearing his uniform.\n\nTindall had one major interest besides sheriffing, and that was making money. He started out by providing logging equipment to other men, and soon became what is called a pulpwood contractor. He bought and sold stands of timber, and acquired a fleet of logging trucks, a truck dealership, and, finally, a small sawmill. He also became a land trader. By the nineteen-seventies, Tindall's businesses were grossing more than two million dollars a year. Many of his employees were ex-residents of his jailhouse. Tindall's standard response to a jobless man who asked for work included providing him with a chain saw, a bobtail truck, and directions to some obscure patch of woods.\n\nHis recordkeeping was loose at best-he never employed a foreman, let alone a bookkeeper-and his lending policies were liberal, with the result that half of San Augustine eventually owed him money. The areas of overlap between his businesses and his work as sheriff, and the potential for conflicts of interest, were endless, and local muttering about corruption and the exploitation of public office grew louder with the years. Tindall, naturally, denies the charges that he grew light-fingered in office. And he was reëlected again and again.\n\nHis generosity helped. Tindall himself reckons that he \"gave away\" a million dollars while he was sheriff. \"Hell, I paid for over fifty babies to be born,\" he told me. \"Everybody, black or white, knew that if a baby was coming and there was no money you just had to call the high sheriff.\"\n\n\"The sheriff's office used to look like a bank,\" Gary Borders recalled. \"People actually stood in line to borrow money from Nathan. Some paid him back, but my impression was that most never did.\"\n\nThe Reverend Cecil Clark, a leader of the local black community, who has done his share of truck driving and pulpwood hauling for Tindall, told me that he would have lost his family's house if Tindall had not stepped in and made the mortgage payments during a bad patch in the seventies. An old black man named Willie Harp, who lives in a shack off a dirt road in the northwestern part of the county, said that the only reason one of his daughters was able to leave San Augustine, attend college, and climb out of poverty was that Mr. Nathan had paid for her education.\n\nTindall's warm relations with his black constituents irritated some whites, who took to calling him \"the nigger sheriff.\" Particularly offensive in the eyes of such whites was his habit of shaking hands with black friends in public. Although he was not above enforcing the segregation of Jim Crow days, Tindall's support in black San Augustine was deep and wide. He was seen as the rare powerful white man who treated the races more or less equally-\"I was just treatin' the blacks the way they make you treat 'em now ,\" he told me-and as the rare sheriff who tempered law enforcement with leniency. \"Tindall wasn't no big crusadin', whip-snappin' sheriff,\" Sam Malone recalled. \"He was a practical man livin' with poor, practical people.\" If a prisoner in Tindall's jail had a job and a family, the sheriff usually let him out in the mornings, so that he could go to work, and locked him up again in the evenings. Tindall cultivated his support in the black community by holding free barbecues and, at election time, by \"hauling votes\"-providing free transportation to the polls, courtesy of operatives like Roger Hale. The black vote, which routinely went more than eighty per cent for Tindall, became the key to his electoral lock, particularly after the civil-rights period and the increase it generated in black-voter registration.\n\nThe civil-rights movement had relatively little impact on San Augustine, however. White resistance was deep: public schools were segregated until 1970, and even then integration occurred only under federal court order. \"Even for the South, this town is not what you would call advanced,\" Leroy Hughes, the principal of San Augustine High School, told me. Hughes, who is black, grew up in Jackson, Mississippi. \"San Augustine is about where Jackson was twenty years ago,\" he said. The town is more than fifty per cent black-and the schools are nearly sixty per cent black-yet the leading local service organizations, the Lions and the Rotary Club, are still exclusively white.\n\nThat the tightwad sheriff was also a one-man charitable foundation was a paradox lost on nobody in San Augustine, least of all Willie Earl Tindall. Yet she claims that, although she knew of her husband's legendary generosity, she never realized how much money his businesses were making until she started reading about it in the press. \"If I'd known that-are you kidding? I would've had my butt in a Cadillac the next minute.\" But Nathan, the work-focussed child of the Depression, never changed his ways to reflect his wealth-he never went on vacation or wore anything but his sheriff's uniform-and by the time Willie Earl realized they were millionaires they weren't.\n\nThat is, Tindall's business fortunes, along with the Texas economy as a whole, turned down sharply in the nineteen-eighties-particularly, in his case, after he bought the San Augustine Sawmill in an effort to keep it from being closed. \"He saw himself as the savior of the county,\" Gary Borders recalled. \"And it just about wiped him out.\" Tindall lost the mill, and then a deep recession in the wood business and a disastrous investment in a floundering local bank plunged him close to bankruptcy.\n\nThe strange thing about Tindall's fall from financial grace, according to those who were there, was that it hardly seemed to affect him. He just kept sheriffing night and day, and claimed not to miss the money. His self-confidence, they said, seemed entirely undiminished.\n\nAnd such unflappability was actually not hard to picture, I found, for by the time I met Tindall he was selling used cars on U.S. 96, having been turned out of office by the voters, drubbed fearfully in the press, and hounded for years on end by various federal investigators; yet \"humbled\" was still about the last word that would have come to mind to describe him. He bustled around the car lot, popping hoods and turning ignitions for a succession of solemn young car shoppers, shouting instructions to a stream of \"hey-boys,\" black and white, who wheeled up in work-batter pickups or crawled out from under jacked, delaminating Buicks. He took me into his office, a grubby box at one end of a sagging mobile home, where, between telephone calls full of business dickering (\"A million feet a month, I'd go five dollars a ton first year, six dollars second year, up to nine dollars fifth year\"), he bragged for two hours about all the timber he had cut and all the crooks he had caught, and shook his head sadly over the performance of his successor. \"He knows about as much about sheriffin' as he does about jet airplanes,\" Tindall said.\n\nThe peculiar authority that Sam Malone noted in Tindall does not arise from his physical presentation. Tindall's boots that day were muddy, his shirt was rumpled, and he wore ill-fitting brown jeans with an oil rag hanging from a front pocket and a pair of rubber-handled pliers protruding from a back pocket. One lens of his glasses, which were thick and steel-rimmed, was severely smudged-from a recent encounter with battery acid, he said. His speech was by turns fumbling, gusty, intense, distracted, and enthusiastic. It was frequently punctuated by laughter. When Tindall saw that some of his humor went right past me, he looked at me quizzically, then seemed to decide that it would all take too long to explain to a Yankee. And when a heavy-browed young black man in coveralls came in, saw that I was taking notes, and started questioning me, Tindall just grinned and let him interrupt.\n\n\"People call me Frog,\" the young man said eagerly.\n\n\"I put him in jail for dope,\" Tindall said.\n\nFrog's eagerness to talk to a journalist vanished. He said it was true, and went about his business.\n\nFrog, I noticed, had addressed Tindall as \"Cap'n,\" and the title somehow sat comfortably between them.\n\nOver the weeks that followed, I often saw Tindall driving somewhere in the company of Frog and some of his equivalents-four or five of them crammed into the cab of a truck, off to cut some timber or pull another truck out of the mud. And the more time I spent in San Augustine-a place where black residents maintain that there are white shop assistants who still won't hand them change directly-the more I came to see how unusual Tindall's common touch truly was. I once watched him and Frog having lunch together at the Hill Top Barbecue. They teased each other cursorily while they waited for their food; then both plunged into plates of barbecued ribs, eating silently, side by side, and hardly looking up except to nod to friends and neighbors as they came through the door. I mentioned to my own lunch companion-Ilester Porter, a furniture restorer, who owns the Hill Top-that Tindall certainly seemed to be a democratic sort. \"Thank you,\" Porter said. \"He's too democratic.\"\n\nI later asked Porter what he meant. Porter, a middle-aged black man who was decidedly not a Tindall supporter, tried to explain. \"The sheriff in a place like San Augustine has one real job,\" he said. \"That's to keep the poor man, black or white, poor, and let the rich man get richer. If a poor man gets into something that lets him stack up a few thousand dollars, the sheriff's got to find some reason to bust him, take away that money by a fine. And he's gotta leave the rich man alone, let him do what he wants. Nathan Tindall didn't do part of his job. He didn't care who got rich, long as he was making money himself. He let white trash like Dave Husband get rich. That's why the rich folk decided to get rid of him, finally. And once them people over on the other side of the tracks decide you're out, you're out. \"\n\nIn a rare local civil-rights triumph, electoral district boundaries were redrawn in San Augustine in the nineteen-seventies to create a black-majority county precinct. This redistricting led to the repeal, in 1972, of Prohibition in the new precinct. And with that repeal Nathan Tindall's job got instantly easier, for bootlegging disappeared overnight.\n\nSince most of San Augustine's bootleggers were black men and women, the legalization of liquor sales shut down a traditional, if déclassé, avenue of black economic opportunity. There were also white bootleggers, however, among whom Dave Husband was easily the best known. His father and his grandfather had been bootleggers before him, operating from their homestead, on the Attoyac River, so Husband had been in the business since he was a boy. By all accounts, he was a savvy trader. With\nlegalization, he quickly opened a liquor store at the intersection of U.S. 96 and State Highway 21, just west of town.\n\nHusband's liquor store prospered, and by the early nineteen-eighties he was a major regional wholesaler and a wealthy man. He became something of a community burgher, known for his generous disbursements to youth groups such as the 4-H Club. But he apparently never lost his outlaw predilections. A compulsive gambler, he took to wearing expensive jewelry and Rolex watches, and liked to brag about the time that Governor Edwin Edwards, of Louisiana, sent a helicopter to fetch him for a gambling date. Husband wasn't just a high roller, though. \"He'd flip quarters in the alley all day\" with poor black men, according to Sam Malone. He also dabbled in all sorts of low-level rackets. \"Dave was always selling a box of nails at half price,\" John Mitchell, a local district judge, recalled. With the money he didn't lose gambling, Husband built onto his house, and by the mid-eighties the old homestead on the Attoyac, where Dave still lived, now with his wife and two teen-age children, looked like the suburban spread of a partner in a Dallas law firm.\n\nAlthough Tindall had arrested Husband for bootlegging any number of times, the two men were friends. Tindall today disputes stories that they were extremely close, but after Husband's father died, in 1961, when Dave was sixteen, Tindall, in his role as all-purpose protector of the county, did look out for the family in ways that the Husbands never forgot. Certainly Dave, once he got established as a legitimate businessman, became a prominent backer of Tindall's, sponsoring campaign barbecues for him on the courthouse square. And the two men were firmly paired, in the eyes of the Old Guard, as upstart poor boys from Pentecostal families down on the Attoyac.\n\nHusband was actually on unusually friendly terms with law enforcement in general. He supplied free liquor to the parties and reunions of various agencies, and took Texas Rangers, highway patrolmen, sheriff's deputies, park rangers, San Augustine's town policemen, and just about anybody else in uniform off on hunting weekends. (Tindall, a lifelong teetotaller and a non-hunter, may have been the only lawman in Deep East Texas who missed out on those stag weekends.)\n\nCampaign barbecues notwithstanding, Tindall's friendship with Husband probably hurt him politically more than it helped him. Tindall's association in the public mind with a motley crowd of jailhouse hangers-on-some of them ex-inmates, all of them the sort of men who hope that a cop's power will rub off on them-definitely hurt him politically. But Tindall, who was never particular about appearances, shrugged it off. \"I never had a preacher come to me with no information,\" he told me. \"It's the thieves that come to you with something, after they done got themselves into something. That's the ones that tell you what you need to know.\"\n\nAnd for many years he could, it was clear, absorb the damage. He did lose one election in the nineteen-fifties, and he once resigned as sheriff for a term in the seventies. Demographics began to work against him, too, after the state dammed the Angelina River, which forms the county's southern border, in 1964. The dam created Sam Rayburn Reservoir, a fisherman's paradise extending over two hundred square miles, whose wooded shores soon sprouted second homes, trailer parks, retirement communities, and other attractions for white strangers with scant interest in the affairs of the sleepy, self-absorbed little town of San Augustine, twenty-five miles away, and with no electoral loyalty to the backwoods boss whom local whites called \"the nigger sheriff.\" Still, Tindall's political base was so solid, his popularity as a dispute settler and old-time paterfamilias so great, that he was all but invincible politically, his everyday power in the county-especially after the Ramseys passed from the scene-seemingly absolute.\n\n\"It was just lucky for San Augustine that Nathan is a good man,\" Willie Earl Tindall said. \"Because he pretty much made up the law himself, whatever he thought was fair. Fortunately, most of what he thought was fair was fair.\" While Mrs. Tindall could be expected to judge her husband's performance charitably, it was generally acknowledged that he enjoyed a rare freedom-very rare for a sheriff in East Texas-from charges that he abused those who tried his patience.\n\nBut Tindall wasn't the only San Augustine official making up the law as he went along. According to Mark McDaniel, an itinerant lawman who joined the town police force in 1986, nobody in San Augustine followed the rules. \"I had worked all over Texas, and I'd never seen anything like it,\" McDaniel told me. \"We'd arrest somebody, and sometimes there'd be no paperwork at all. It was strange. They had never even run a search warrant. When I wanted to go to a J.P. with a probable cause, they said, 'We don't do that here.' It wasn't just Tindall. It was everybody. And I got to be the same way, six months after I started.\" Though Tindall didn't have formal jurisdiction over the town police, he had effective command, according to McDaniel. The town policemen all took their cues from Tindall, and sometimes they got them wrong. McDaniel once arrested (for reckless driving) one of the ruffians who hung around the jailhouse. His fellow-officers told him that he had unwittingly arrested a Tindall crony, who enjoyed the sheriff's protection. But Tindall then held the suspect without bail for a week or two. \"They had it dead wrong,\" McDaniel said. \"There was no protection.\"\n\nMcDaniel also heard the rumors about Tindall being corrupt. \"People would say that Tindall could make sure that a D.W.I. never went on your record,\" he said. \"That's ridiculous. The sheriff of San Augustine, Texas, has no say about what does or doesn't go on your record in Austin. But people here don't understand that. They're just so used to thinking that the high sheriff is all-powerful.\"\n\nA lesser but similar awe surrounded other peace officers in San Augustine. \"People here are just obsessed with law enforcement,\" McDaniel said. \"Many of them don't have much of a life, I guess. Most places, nobody really notices who the cops are. Here, I hadn't been on the job a month and I had an invitation to dinner at someone's house every night of the week. You're a little celebrity.\" In such a climate, petty corruption was rampant, according to McDaniel. \"We never bought beer or whiskey,\" he said. \"We never paid for the food at our cookouts. You know, when you're making eleven hundred dollars a month you're always ready for a free six-pack. And our biggest buddy-nobody likes to admit this now-was Dave Husband. Every night, we'd meet over at his store-the highway patrol and everybody-and drink Cokes, eat chips, whole-head cheese, whatever we wanted.\"\n\nLong after Nathan Tindall left the sheriff's office, some people were, I found, still muttering that he had been corrupt, and not merely on a petty, complimentary-six-pack scale. But in virtually every case these people refused to be specific, at least with me, in their allegations. And an informal survey of some of those who worked with Tindall when he was sheriff-two county judges, the county treasurer, the district attorney, the county attorney, the town attorney, the town police chief, various deputies, the only two real newspapermen in town-yielded no one who credited the charges that he was corrupt.\n\nThere was a crucial change in the mixture of law enforcement in San Augustine after bootlegging was rendered obsolete. Marijuana farmers, whose crop thrived in the fertile forests of East Texas, effectively replaced moonshiners in the local underground economy, and marijuana traffickers replaced bootleggers. And, while Nathan Tindall had little trouble keeping track of local people who got involved in marijuana-some were farmers who had fallen on hard times, and others were ex-bootleggers looking for a new trade, or underemployed loggers looking to turn a remote clear-cut into a gold mine-he sometimes found that he needed help when the scale of growing or dealing was larger, was regional rather than local. Though it was a point of pride with him to call for outside help as seldom as possible, he did occasionally call on the state police, with whom he had always been on good terms. Marvin McLeroy, a senior detective in the state narcotics office in Lufkin, recalled taking some of his men to stake out a large field of marijuana that Tindall, who didn't have the manpower to watch it, had found deep in the woods in San Augustine County. The growers got spooked and escaped, but the state police tore out sixty thousand plants.\n\n\"Of course, working in San Augustine was always a unique experience,\" McLeroy told me. \"Because if it wasn't cleared with Nathan it didn't happen. I could drive through the county, not even stop for a cup of coffee, and when I got back to my office the phone would ring and it would be Tindall wanting to know what I was doing. The man had resources. \"\n\nRicky Allen, another state narcotics officer, said, \"I went over there to San Augustine once to bust a dealer named Bo Barnes. Nathan asked me, 'What's he got?' I told him something like five pounds of pot. Nathan wanted to just phone the old boy and tell him to get on down to the jailhouse with the dope. I told him I didn't want to do that. I wanted to go out there with a search warrant. Nathan said, 'A search warrant?' Finally, we just drove out to Bo's trailer, and Nathan hollered for him to come on out, and he did. Then Nathan told him to go back in and get all his dope and cash. And Bo did it. He brung out four or five pounds of pot and twenty-three hundred dollars. We arrested him, but Bo kept saying it was all a mistake. See, he had been dealing coke, and Nathan had told him to stop, so Bo figured that meant it was O.K. to go back to selling pot, because the Captain didn't tell him he couldn't.\"\n\nFederal agencies were not among Tindall's resources. He had worked with the F.B.I. when it was chasing draft evaders during the Vietnam era, and he claims to have always had cordial dealings with the feds. But his deep reluctance to invite them into San Augustine was well known, both locally and in the federal offices in Beaumont and elsewhere. Charles Ruth, a former federal magistrate in Beaumont, said, \"Tindall didn't think he needed the F.B.I., and the F.B.I. is trained to be egomaniacs, so there was a problem.\" Marvin McLeroy said, \"Nathan and San Augustine have been a thorn in the side of the feds for a long time.\" Thus, when the federal government-not just the F.B.I. but the Drug Enforcement Administration, various task forces, and every ambitious federal prosecutor in America-got more interested in the drug trade, as part of the ever-escalating war on drugs of the mid-eighties, Tindall was not necessarily aware of the fact.\n\nAround the same time, cocaine began to replace marijuana as the main commodity in the East Texas drug trade. Cocaine moved much faster than pot, in every sense. It cost more, yielded a higher profit, involved much higher levels of the criminal world, was far harder to interdict, and, in the form of crack-the cheap, smokable version of the drug, which soon caught on locally-wreaked on its users a social and medical havoc unlike anything associated with marijuana. \"Cocaine is just another level,\" Mark McDaniel, the itinerant lawman, said. \"It's hard to bust. And Tindall didn't have the training, the people, the knowledge, the technology.\"\n\nTindall did have a notion, though, about who was bringing cocaine into San Augustine, and he mentioned his notion to McLeroy, of the state police, in 1987. The suspect was Lenard Jackson, a local black man who had lived for many years in Houston but still had family in San Augustine. Jackson's brother Herbert was, in fact, the county's first black commissioner, and he was still in office. \"But we didn't go after Lenard Jackson, because he lived in Houston,\" McLeroy told me. \"And Nathan, you know, probably didn't contact anybody else who could've done something. Nathan only talked to people he liked.\"\n\nLenard Jackson grew up in Greertown, a rural community in northern San Augustine County, at the eastern end of an old black district known as the Pre-Emption. No part of the county swarms with more ghosts than the Pre-Emption. After Emancipation, ex-slaves flocked to the area. It had been lightly settled by whites, for it was hilly and heavily wooded, roads were poor or nonexistent, and the soil was sandy. Unclaimed land could be \"pre-empted,\" or homesteaded, for as little as fifty cents an acre. Jackson's great-grandfather Claiborne Greer was a slave on the Greer plantation and then one of the early black landowners, in what came to be called Greertown. The black settlers logged and cleared their fields by hand. They grew corn, peas, cotton, watermelons, and peanuts. They raised hogs and cattle and farmed with mules. People worshipped at little clapboard Baptist churches in the woods and, in summer, gathered for baseball tournaments with black teams from all over East Texas and western Louisiana.\n\nLenard Jackson, who was born in 1948, grew up as the countryside was starting to empty. The Second World War had pulled large numbers of people off the land, and after the war many chose not to return to life behind a plow or on the end of a crosscut saw. Small-scale Southern farming was becoming, in any case, less viable-Lenard Jackson picked cotton in the red lands as a boy, but cotton was then leaving San Augustine for the flatlands of West Texas-and black farmers, unable to finance new equipment and expansion, were disappearing fastest. Between 1940 and 1960, the rural black population in Texas fell fifty per cent; the number of black farmers fell seventy per cent.\n\nToday, there is no black commercial farming in Greertown or anywhere else in the Pre-Emption. Those black-owned fields still under cultivation are leased to white farmers, who use Mexican itinerant labor. Most of the old fields are now forest again-thickly overgrown with slash pine. Perhaps half the land in the Pre-Emption still belongs to blacks, and title to much of that is hopelessly mired among absentee heirs.\n\nFrank Jackson, Lenard's father, hung on to his land. He was a farmer and logger; he and his wife had fifteen children. Lenard, the eighth, was in the tenth grade at the segregated high school in San Augustine when Frank died, in 1966. Lenard left school and went to work hauling pulpwood. Like his older siblings, most of whom had already left for California or Houston, Lenard saw plainly that his chances of making a decent living in San Augustine were bleak. The only black people doing so were schoolteachers, the undertaker, the insurance agent, and a few enterprising souls who supplemented legal incomes with bootlegging. None of those avenues were open to Lenard, and in 1969 he ended up moving to Houston.\n\nHe joined the construction workers' union and started as a laborer. There was plenty of work: Houston boomed throughout the nineteen-seventies. Jackson rose to labor foreman, concrete foreman, general foreman. He was, from all accounts, a ferociously hard worker. He took a second job at night, and with his savings he bought a garbage truck. He landed a contract to haul garbage from Burger Kings, and found a dump that stayed open until midnight. As a labor foreman, Jackson became a kind of one-man hiring hall for other young men from San Augustine. Thus, when he went out on his own as a construction contractor, in the mid-seventies, he had a pool of loyal, experienced workers to draw on. By that time, he had married Girtha Mae Polley, who was from East Liberty-his mother's home place, a few miles northeast of Greertown-and had bought his first house, a bungalow out among the gasworks and bayous east of Houston. His company started pouring foundations for Sambo's, a chain of twenty-four-hour restaurants. \"There were a lot of jokes,\" Jackson recalled. \"You know, 'Got a bunch of Sambos out here doing the Sambo's.' But that didn't bother me too much. The work was good.\"\n\nThe work was very good, especially once Jackson had begun winning contracts to build the little L-shaped shopping centers, known as \"strip centers,\" that surround Houston in their multitudes. By the early eighties, his company, LJ Construction, employed eighty people, including most of his eleven brothers, and had jobs going all over metropolitan Houston. \"If we was in Houston, and we was ridin', I could show you some of the buildings we made to come up out of the ground,\" Herbert Jackson, who occasionally worked for Lenard, told me. \"Seems like we must have poured half the concrete in Houston.\" Only Herbert and one disabled sister stayed for extended periods in Greertown, with their widowed mother, but all the children, led by Lenard, contributed to the maintenance of the place, and to the regular replacement of their mother's Ford with a new one. To many people in black San Augustine, the Jacksons were, in fact, an exemplary family: hardworking and dutiful toward their elders.\n\nLenard, now the prosperous contractor, bought a lot in Pearland, a flat, windy exurb south of Houston, and built a sprawling, one-story Spanish-style brick house with six arches across the front and tinted windows. The house acquired mythic proportions back in San Augustine: Roger Hale told me that it was worth three-quarters of a million dollars, though its real value was perhaps a hundred and fifty thousand. It was a powerful symbol, in any case, of a local boy's success in the city. Jackson also bought another such symbol: a secondhand Rolls-Royce-not, he later said, because he particularly liked the car but because his wife liked it and because it would hold its resale value. (He continued to drive a pickup truck.) He raised rabbits in his back yard, and put in a modest basketball court, and on weekends he held barbecues at his house for the many young San Augustinians who worked for him. The fact that he was widely admired and considered a fair employer sometimes put Jackson in a difficult position. \"If you said you were from San Augustine, and needed money, I'd find something for you, because I knew how it was, trying to get started,\" he recalled. \"But that meant I worked a lot of San Augustine guys I didn't need. And that hurt me down the line.\"\n\nWhen the Texas economy crashed, in the nineteen-eighties, Houston construction went down with it. Jackson's business began to suffer from competition with what he called \"Spanish guys\"-undocumented Mexican laborers working for Anglo contractors for four dollars an hour. Some of Jackson's workers had been making more than a hundred dollars a day. He lowered that to eighty, and then, when things got desperate, to sixty.\n\nAt some point-exactly when is a matter of dispute-Jackson went into the illegal-drug trade. First marijuana, according to the state narcotics police, and then cocaine. \"I had a lot of things to keep up, people to take care of,\" he told me.\n\nCocaine made its way into Deep East Texas by various routes. Some came from Los Angeles, through family contacts with the Crips and the Bloods, the vast L.A. street gangs. Typically, a gang member in trouble with the law in L.A. would come to hide out with his country grandparents, find that the local cocaine market was ill-protected or nonexistent, and move to establish a franchise, bringing in drugs overland from the West Coast. Most of the cocaine trade in East Texas, however, was carried on by local entrepreneurs.\n\nBeing near Houston was convenient. \"Houston has replaced Miami as the nation's drug capital,\" the United States Attorney in Beaumont told me. (California officials make the same claim for Los Angeles.) Whatever its ranking, Houston has become the clearing house for a staggering amount of cocaine. Both of the world's preëminent cocaine empires, the Cali and the Medellín cartels of Colombia, have established large-scale import-and-distribution operations there.\n\nAmerican dealers buy from the Colombians at whatever level they can afford. The domestic dealerships are ethnically segmented-white and Latino traffickers sell powdered cocaine, mostly to white and Latino users, while African-Americans sell crack, mostly to black users-but are otherwise diffuse and loosely structured. For sophistication and corporate-style discipline, certainly no local drug organization can compete with the Colombian suppliers, who are regarded with awe by many of their retailers. \"They won't even do business with nobody that starts using drugs,\" a black former crack dealer in Houston told me. \"They find out you're using, they just kill you.\" This rule, if it is indeed ever applied, was definitely not followed in San Augustine in the mid-eighties, when Arthur Watts and Willie Ray (Blue Tick) Edwards, two part-time pulpwood haulers and full-time ne'er-do-wells, hooked up with a couple of low-level Colombian dealers, brothers named Aldon and Ivan Aguirre, in Houston, and began to run small quantities of cocaine up into the woods to support their own habits.\n\nThe demand for cocaine exploded with the invention of crack. In East Texas, makeshift legions of small-time dealers began shuttling between Houston and their home towns, typically buying an ounce or two of powder, \"rocking it up\" into crack, selling five- and ten- and twenty-dollar rocks to cover costs, and smoking up their profits. The Arthur Wattses and Blue Tick Edwardses were unlikely to be left alone in a business with such volume and positive cash flow, and in San Augustine they were soon joined by an older, far cannier, and more sober businessman-Lenard Jackson. According to the F.B.I., Jackson started buying cocaine in kilogram quantities in Houston from a mid-level Colombian connection named Celestino Morales, who was linked to the Cali cartel, and some of the young men who worked in Jackson's construction firm started carrying it with them on their frequent trips home to San Augustine.\n\nJackson's couriers included Harlon Kelly and his half brother Steven Kelly, who was an \"outside\" son of Jackson's. Jackson had bought a modern ranch house behind his family's farm in Greertown, and the Kelly brothers were soon doing a roaring cocaine business there, building a network of sub-dealers, many of them former high-school classmates who had either stayed in San Augustine or, like them, returned unemployed from Houston. These sub-dealers, who included Roger Hale's son Daryl, were usually not drug users, though some, such as Harlon Kelly, had a parent who was a cocaine addict.\n\nCrack caught on in San Augustine mainly in poor black neighborhoods-in the Quarters and, especially, in the Sunset Hills housing project. \"It was a good high,\" Shirley Bell, a Sunset Hills resident, told me, simply. \"Something to do. And everybody else was doing it.\" Bell's son, Michael, who was a friend and former classmate of the Kellys' and Daryl Hale's, objected to his mother's smoking crack, though his own authority on the subject was limited by the fact that he himself was selling it. In fact, Michael Bell became one of the more successful local dealers. He had not had a job since high school-and had never left San Augustine-but he started driving a new car, bought a number of quarter horses (including one that was reported to have cost nine thousand dollars), and, in early 1989, vacationed in Acapulco with Daryl Hale and another friend. \"Easy money,\" his mother said flatly. \"Everybody saw it, everybody wanted it.\"\n\nSarah Oliphant, a Sunset Hills resident, got hooked on crack in November, 1988. She soon lost her job, and eventually her health. \"These whole projects, we was really lookin' rough and ugly,\" she recalled. \"Everybody skinny and sickly. I wore a sweater cap, 'cause I wouldn't comb my hair. I got down to ninety-eight pounds.\" That's perhaps half of what she weighs today. \"She was po' as a snake,\" her mother put in.\n\nA few whites got into crack, but the illegal drugs of choice among whites remained marijuana and methamphetamine, or speed, both of which are produced locally, the East Texas woods being almost as convenient for meth labs, which give off a powerful telltale odor, as for pot growing. Among a few white crack addicts who gained the trust of the black dealers in San Augustine were Dave Husband's daughter, Sheila Fussell, and the troubled heir to a drygoods fortune, who used to drive over from Louisiana.\n\nThe radius of the San Augustine cocaine market grew well beyond the county's boundaries during the first half of 1989. Customers, and even small-time dealers, from the surrounding counties (and from Fort Polk, a Louisiana Army base eighty-five miles away, where at least a regiment of crackheads seemed to be stationed) started making their way to San Augustine-to Jackson's ranch house, or to Sunset Hills, or to Blue Tick Edwards' trailer, out on a country road known as Spur 85-to score. Some San Augustine dealers also went on the road: one would rent a motel room in, say, Center, the next town north, for a weekend and sell off a load of rocks to local users. For San Augustine's young entrepreneurs, who were accustomed to being patronized by their traditional rivals in Center as the natives of a backward county without industry or initiative, it was a sweet turnabout.\n\nAnother kind of socioeconomic turnabout was occurring within San Augustine, as a growing number of young black men began to display unprecedented buying power at local car dealerships and at clothing and jewelry and furniture stores. In some cases, these were the same establishments that had once punished the ancestors of the prosperous new customers for nonpayment of their bills with whippings or forced land-title transfers. The drug dealers paid cash. But the most startling image of the new black prosperity, and surely the most difficult for many whites to accept, was Lenard Jackson, up from Houston, tooling around in his blue Rolls-Royce.\n\nDave Husband, people often say, went into the drug trade simply because he couldn't bear the thought of Jackson's being a more successful entrepreneur than he was. More likely, Husband, who owned a tavern where a lot of small-scale drug dealing went on, just saw a business opportunity too tempting to pass up. \"Daddy was raised to bootleg, and somewhere back in his head he probably never saw no difference between bootlegging and the drug business,\" Sheila Fussell says. \"He told me later that he'd started losing most of his liquor business to the drug business. And he just 'wanted to see what the drug business was like.' Those were his words.\"\n\nJackson, instead of resenting the new competition, apparently welcomed Husband's entry into the trade, perhaps on the theory that Husband might divert some of the unwelcome law-enforcement attention he himself had begun to attract. According to the F.B.I., Jackson introduced Husband to Celestino Morales, in Houston, and Morales began to supply Husband with cocaine directly. In San Augustine, Husband dealt mainly in wholesale quantities, but Blue Tick Edwards recalls Husband's coming around to his trailer, ostensibly to help him break down a package and cook it up into crack, but really, Edwards believed, to watch his retail sales operation, to collect his payment before Edwards could spend it, and, if possible, to steal a few of Edwards' customers.\n\nHow extensive did the San Augustine drug trade become? The F.B.I., as has been noted, announced that seventy-five pounds of cocaine, with a street value of more than three million dollars, was passing through the county each week by mid-1989. These figures, if they were accurate, would have made San Augustine a major regional drug-distribution center. But other law-enforcement officials, such as Kenneth Kidwell, of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Tyler, questioned whether the drug problem in San Augustine was really any different from or bigger than the drug problem in other East Texas communities.\n\nBe that as it may, Nathan Tindall's main challenger in the 1988 election for sheriff-a local butcher and former grocer named Charles Bryan, who had no law-enforcement experience-made \"drugs\" virtually the entire basis of his campaign, and it was soon clear that he was reaching voters with his message. People frightened by the rapid growth of the drug trade, or by the ravages of crack, began moving toward Bryan. This group included both whites, some of whom simply didn't like the idea of blacks' getting uppity-a prejudice that \"drugs\" covered nicely-and blacks, who had traditionally voted for Tindall but were now worried that he wasn't doing enough to stop drugs.\n\nIt wasn't true that Tindall was doing little or nothing about the problem. He had suspected Lenard Jackson a year earlier, after all, and had reported him to the state narcotics police then. He ran regular stings on dealers and users, and harassed the more hapless mid-level dealers, like Blue Tick Edwards, mercilessly. \"Mr. Nathan arrested me so many times,\" Edwards recalled. \"He picked me up every two or three months. Caught me once in the projects with some cocaine, and got me and my wife thrown out of Sunset Hills. That's how we ended up in my trailer.\"\n\nStill, a consensus obviously formed among voters that it was time for a change in the sheriff's office-that, for whatever reasons, cocaine was getting away from Tindall. The solidly black precincts still went heavily for the high sheriff, but the county's white voters, particularly the couple of thousand newcomers down on Sam Rayburn Reservoir, put Bryan over the top in the Democratic primary in the spring, and then, when Tindall managed to get his name on the ballot for the general election, defeated him again in November.\n\nOperation White Tornado began as two separate investigations-one local, the other external. The local effort was the initiative of Larry Saurage, the chief deputy sheriff, whom Charles Bryan hired when he took office. Bryan, though he looks the part of a Texas sheriff-he's tall, heavy, firm-jawed, and white-haired, and wears a white cowboy hat-had wisely grasped the fact that his career as a butcher and groceryman had not prepared him for a leadership role in law enforcement, and he had gone looking for an experienced chief deputy. Saurage, a well-travelled lawman who was then working narcotics down in Chambers County, between Houston and Beaumont, fit the bill. He came to San Augustine in January of 1989, and within a few weeks he had brought in Betty Donatto, a black undercover narcotics agent from the Liberty County sheriff's office (Liberty is next door to Chambers), to help him put together drug cases in San Augustine. Donatto, passing herself off as Bennie Lee Thibodeaux, a good-time girl originally from Louisiana, was paired up by Saurage with a local informant, who helped her infiltrate the county's drug scene, starting in the Sunset Hills housing project.\n\nMeanwhile, Marvin McLeroy, of the state narcotics office, had begun his own investigation in San Augustine the previous September, prompted by persistent reports that Lenard Jackson, Dave Husband, Blue Tick Edwards, Arthur Watts, and Daryl Hale were dealing drugs, and by rumors of corruption in the sheriff's office. McLeroy, without informing any local agency of his activities, used informants to buy cocaine from Arthur Watts and Daryl Hale, and invited federal authorities into the investigation. (Charles Bryan, while still a candidate for sheriff, had also got in touch with the United States Attorney's office in Beaumont about the drug problem in San Augustine.) Stuart Platt, an assistant federal prosecutor, now took charge of the investigation, with field command going to F.B.I. Special Agent Zechariah (Zack) Shelton. Shelton had played a leading part in a 1988 investigation of Sheriff  James Wade, of Orange County, near Beaumont, which resulted in Wade's conviction on federal drug and corruption charges. And Platt and Shelton's chief quarry in San Augustine seems to have been, from the outset, Nathan Tindall-whom Shelton later described to me as \"a true boss-hog sheriff.\" The state and federal investigators continued to shun local law-enforcement offices in San Augustine. For local assistance, they turned to the Shelby County district attorney's office, in Center, and to Robert Cartwright, a young policeman in Port Arthur, whose father, John Matthew Cartwright, was a patrolman in the San Augustine town police.\n\nBut then, in March, Platt and Shelton's men began to run across Betty Donatto's trail in San Augustine. Concerned that her investigation might inadvertently abort theirs, they went to the Liberty County sheriff's office, learned of Saurage's operation, and got in touch with Saurage. According to Shelton, Saurage was angry to discover that outside agencies were working on his new turf. He agreed to coöperate with the F.B.I. and the state narcotics office, however, though his boss, Charles Bryan, whose ability to keep professional secrets was untested, was to be left in the dark. John Matthew Cartwright's superior, the town chief of police, was also left in the dark-even though the command center for Platt and Shelton's operation was set up in a trailer in a pecan orchard behind Cartwright's mother's house. (A tornado that spring, which rocked the trailer, gave rise to the operation's catchy title.) For Chief Deputy Saurage, actively running undercover agents and informants right under the nose of even an inexperienced sheriff soon proved to be more trouble than it was worth, and in April he and his colleagues let Charles Bryan in on the operation. According to the F.B.I.'s Shelton, \"We just told Bryan, 'Stay out of our way, and we'll make you a hero.' \"\n\nBetty Donatto, who is a sleepy-eyed, soft-voiced, russet-haired woman in her early forties, remained the key agent of the combined operation. She had been doing police work for only a few years, having worked previously as a computer operator in California and as a journalist in Liberty County, but, once she started in law enforcement, she had risen quickly, becoming a small-town police chief and then discovering a talent for undercover work. Her partner in San Augustine, a local crack addict named Bo Garrett, had been dubious about her at first. Her skin was too light for her to pass unaccosted in the black drug world, he thought. But Donatto figured that the Louisiana cover story would help ease suspicion, since Louisiana was known for its mixed-race population; and, besides, her real upbringing in a black family in East Texas gave her the wherewithal to blend in socially.\n\n\"It worked good,\" she told me later, in a restaurant in Houston. \"We just told people I was Bo's girlfriend, living in Houston. I started out buying twenty-dollar rocks, and moved on up to one-fifties. If people wondered why I never smoked, I told 'em I worked for the airlines-'Hey, I gotta take a pee test tomorrow.' I'd say I was just up there to see Bo, and I was buying for somebody in Houston. I was driving a white Corvette-a seized vehicle from Liberty County. That got their attention.\"\n\nDonatto laughed lightly. \"I mean, San Augustine was sad . A lot of the people there didn't even have cars. It was like they had no connection to the outside world. After a while, I started feeling like Santa Claus. I used to buy a box of chicken, maybe a case of beer, and drive up into the projects, and they'd all come crowd around the car, ask me for chicken and beer, and tell me everything that was going on. 'Hey, Jackson's in town!'\n\n\"Nobody was afraid of the city police. The crooks were afraid of Tindall, and they told me to watch out for him, because he still ran the show, even if he was in the background. But San Augustine was pretty unusual-at least, when I was there. It was so open and free. And you could kind of understand it, because you're really away from everything up there. If you had the right amount of money, it was like you could set up your own little world, and nobody could touch you. I could see how Dave Husband and Lenard Jackson thought they'd never get caught. There were all these weak-minded people around who they could just control. In the projects, the Ranch\"-Lenard Jackson's house in Greertown-\"was considered Heaven.\"\n\nDonatto befriended some of the local crackheads and dealers, including Sarah Oliphant and Michael Bell. She bought cocaine from Blue Tick Edwards, out in his trailer on Spur 85, on several occasions, sometimes encountering Roger Hale there (those encounters helped put Hale away), and ultimately managed to overcome the suspicions of Willie Earl Dade, Tindall's ex-deputy, and buy half an ounce from him behind a tavern on U.S. 96, for six hundred dollars-the largest purchase she made in San Augustine.\n\nShe had no luck buying dope from Dave Husband, however. \"The word was, Husband didn't deal anything small. It was half a kilo on up, and you needed an introduction. We tried to make buys with a couple of different informants, but they both failed. I was there for the second one. It was a white girl from Jasper, who said she'd bought from him before. But Husband just said he didn't know what she was talking about.\"\n\nDonatto knew that a major target of the federal investigation was Nathan Tindall. \"They told me to find out anything I could about Tindall being crooked,\" she said. \"But all I ever got was hearsay.\"\n\nEventually, Donatto made her way out to the paradise of Lenard Jackson's ranch house, in the company of a young woman, \"a hyper crack smoker\" whom she had hooked up with. This young woman was among the select customers who were welcome to visit the ranch house, and Donatto watched her make a buy from \"Jackson's sons,\" as she knew Harlon and Steven Kelly. Donatto later began going out there on her own, and succeeded in buying half an ounce of crack from Roy Jackson, one of Lenard's brothers. Roy subsequently invited her \"to go partying to Louisiana with him.\" Donatto wanted to go, but Shelton and Saurage thought it sounded too risky. \"Zack was a nervous wreck about me,\" Donatto recalled. \"I appreciated that, because working in San Augustine was lonely. Working undercover for a long time gets weird. They say you should never do it for more than three months. You forget who you are. You can't think about anything else. I'd go home to Liberty County to see my daughter, but all I could think about was how I wasn't really getting what the feds wanted. I actually couldn't wait to get back in my dirty jeans and my Corvette, and this straw hat I always wore up there.\"\n\nOther local informants were also used. One of them was a small-time dealer named Ricky Davis. Fitted out with a tape recorder, Davis allegedly managed to buy half an ounce of powdered cocaine in April from Dave Husband's brother Buck-though the tape ran out before the deal was consummated. Davis claimed that in the past he had bought cocaine from Dave Husband himself, and also from Husband's son Neil. But Davis had a credibility problem. When his controllers heard that he was still selling drugs, even while he was informing, they took him to a secluded park in San Augustine to discuss the matter with him. Davis denied the reports vehemently. Then Betty Donatto stepped out from behind a tree. \"He had been selling to me,\" Donatto said, laughing. \"He didn't know I was a narc. Ricky about fainted. We worked together after that. But he was always a nervous wreck.\"\n\nIn late April, \"pen registers\" were attached to the telephones of various suspects, recording the time, the date, and the number dialled for outgoing calls, and in May the F.B.I. and the state narcotics police began actually tapping the telephones of more than a dozen \"subject individuals\" in and around San Augustine. Agent Shelton's application to a federal district judge for permission to do more wiretapping, including Nathan Tindall's phone, described the progress of Operation White Tornado, and concluded, \"Normal investigative procedures have been tried and failed.\" Some of the failures of normal investigative procedures were evident in the application itself, which described Michael Bell as being married to his mother, assured the judge that Dave Husband owned the town's one hotel (this would have been news to Husband), and twice described Husband as Nathan Tindall's nephew.\n\nThe \"Facts and Circumstances Overview\" section of Shelton's application relied heavily on \"facts\" obtained from confidential informants; the news that Husband was Tindall's nephew, for instance, came from two separate informants, the second \"corroborating\" the first, according to Shelton. One of these two informants was in the county jail in Houston, had been to San Augustine once, and had evidently never met Tindall, yet was able to assure Shelton that Tindall was corrupt. The other informant-who was unnamed in the application-was Ricky Davis, and he claimed that he had seen Edgar Price, one of Lenard Jackson's couriers, pay Tindall a thousand dollars during a traffic stop in 1987 or 1988. \"Affiant believes,\" wrote Shelton, referring to himself, \"that Nathan Tindall was integrally involved in providing protection to various cocaine dealers.\" He added that he suspected Tindall might be laundering money for Husband and Arthur Watts through a local bank where he was then working. Shelton even managed to interpret Marvin McLeroy's report that Tindall had approached him about Lenard Jackson's activities in 1987 as evidence that Jackson must have started paying off Tindall then.\n\nThe additional wiretaps were authorized, and the investigators, listening in from their trailer in the pecan orchard, continued to gather information on the San Augustine drug trade. Some of the dealers, although they were usually infuriatingly vague and wary on the phone, made some reasonably incriminating remarks, but Nathan Tindall apparently never said anything of interest. \"I'm just lucky that Dave Husband and them others never had accounts at my bank,\" Tindall told me. \"Because if they did the feds would have put that on me, called it laundering.\"\n\nIn late May, the commanders of Operation White Tornado decided that it was time to pounce. Betty Donatto was astonished. \"I couldn't believe they wanted to pull the cord then,\" she says. \"I had just worked my way up from the projects to the Ranch, and I only needed a couple more months. We could have got more on the Houston connection, Louisiana, the Colombians. Zack Shelton knew I thought it was too soon. But he said Ricky Davis said the crooks were getting suspicious of me and were going to bump me off. Except everybody knew that Ricky was a nervous wreck. He just wanted the whole thing to end.\"\n\nAnd so, late on the rainy afternoon of June 2, 1989, a vast paramilitary convoy, complete with newspaper reporters and TV camera crews, streamed into San Augustine, carrying more than two hundred heavily armed agents from the F.B.I., the Drug Enforcement Administration, the United States Customs Service, the United States Marshals, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Army's Criminal Investigation Division, the state Highway Patrol, the state police, the Texas Rangers, and police departments and sheriff's offices in half a dozen nearby counties and parishes, with helicopters thundering overhead. Houses, taverns, trailers, and liquor stores were raided on the strength of seventeen federal search warrants. Property was seized and suspects were arrested on the basis of three sealed federal indictments and\nsixteen criminal complaints. In the TV footage, burly agents swarm up U.S. 96, brandishing automatic weapons and shouting as they order frightened black people down on their faces in the mud. Lenard Jackson, who, with his wife, had attended the high-school graduation of a niece and a nephew up in Shelby County that afternoon, was stopped on the highway by a patrol car backed up by a helicopter. He was made to stand spread-eagled, his hands on the hot hood of his Rolls-Royce, a gun at his head. Dave Husband was arrested at his store. Willie Earl Dade was found in his girlfriend's trailer, about to cook up a batch of cocaine-the only drugs actually found in the raid. Little or no resistance was offered. The only injury occurred when Blue Tick Edwards, surprised in his trailer, tried to flee, and dislocated his shoulder in the ensuing struggle. \"Me and my wife just been laying up in the bed all day, using drugs and making love, and I didn't know what was going on,\" he said later. By nightfall, thirty-one suspects had been taken into custody. Tindall, who had not been named in either the indictments or the complaints, was not arrested.\n\nBetty Donatto was there for the raid, but did little. \"I was in a vehicle with some F.B.I. guys,\" she recalled. \"And they had every type of gun you can name. Machine guns, AK-47s. Of course, they didn't need all them guns and dogs and a helicopter in little San Augustine. But I kept quiet. I just figured, This is really gonna make Larry and his sheriff look good. That's what this is about.\" And on the courthouse square that evening, watching the crowd applaud and the TV cameras jostle for position as a handcuffed Lenard Jackson was hustled into the jail, Donatto marvelled at Charles Bryan's performance. \"Larry's sheriff,\" who had been so firmly excluded from Operation White Tornado, was reaping the reward that Zack Shelton had promised him. \"There he was, shaking hands and grinning and accepting all the credit,\" Donatto recalled. \"And I told my captain, Tom, who came up from Liberty County for the raid, 'I can't believe this.' At the end of the whole situation, I just had to give that man an Academy Award.\"\n\nNaturally, Nathan Tindall said that if it had been up to him he'd have conducted Operation White Tornado by telephone, just calling up the suspects and telling them to come on down to the jailhouse and bring their dope. He'd probably have got more dope that way than the pittance the feds found, too, he reckoned. Why did the feds stage the raid when they did? According to Tindall, the answer was that they were nervous because he, Tindall, had just started work as an investigator for Charles Mitchell, the district attorney (who knew nothing about Operation White Tornado), and they were afraid that he might break up the drug trade himself, stealing all their glory. As it happened, Mitchell let Tindall go immediately, reasoning that the former sheriff would not make an effective investigator while under a cloud of federal suspicion.\n\nThat cloud only darkened in the days after the raid, as veiled and not so veiled charges began to rain down on Tindall. Stuart Platt explained to reporters that Operation White Tornado had been necessary because local law enforcement in San Augustine had been \"compromised.\" The F.B.I., during detention hearings in Beaumont for the White Tornado defendants, testified, according to the Beaumont Enterprise, that \"Tindall was difficult to work with and offered little cooperation on drug investigations.\"\n\nIt seemed only a matter of time before he would be indicted, his disgrace complete. On the day after the drug raid, Tindall was served with a federal court order to turn over the bank records of seven of the White Tornado suspects, and a few weeks later he was subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury in Beaumont to answer allegations by one of the suspects that he had taken payoffs. In early July, Tindall's house was searched twice in one week by Zack Shelton and Larry Saurage. On the second visit, they were accompanied by I.R.S. agents. Tindall's tax records were seized, along with dozens of old guns he had taken from the evidence room at the sheriff's office when he left, and a small bag of marijuana. The marijuana was a prop that Tindall had been using for years in anti-drug lectures at schools, and the guns still had evidence tags on them-Tindall had left instructions that anybody who wanted to reclaim a weapon should get in touch with him-but the episode did little to improve his press. \"SEARCH OF EX-SHERIFF'S HOUSE NETS GUNS, DRUGS\" was how the Beaumont Enterprise played it, illustrating its story with a photograph of Charles Bryan with the confiscated arsenal. The San Augustine Tribune , a timid weekly in normal times, actually ran verbatim several paragraphs of the search warrant that Larry Saurage had sworn out in order to enter the home of the county's former boss hog.\n\nBryan, Saurage, Shelton, Platt, and Platt's superior, United States Attorney Bob Wortham, were the local (and not so local) heroes of the hour. Zack Shelton was shown on ABC News making a speech on the San Augustine courthouse square, where, according to Peter Jennings, residents were \"cheering the police who liberated their town.\"\n\nAs a news story, Operation White Tornado worked. It had good guys, bad guys (Lenard Jackson's seized Rolls-Royce made countless TV appearances, as the lurid emblem of a black man's ill-gotten gains), and a great little official-corruption angle. It also revealed a vivid new front in the war on drugs-a picturesque, one-stoplight Southern town, where American flags hung over canopied sidewalks on the courthouse square-and even some San Augustinians seemed pleased to see the raid in that quasi-national context. Dr. Curtis Haley, a conservative local landowner and physician, circulated a public resolution, signed by some six hundred of his neighbors, thanking Bob Wortham and his colleagues and urging them, \"Please continue with your crusade of providing a Drug Free America not only in this community and county but all others in the great State of Texas.\" Virtually nothing was said publicly about the disparity between the amount of cocaine alleged to have been moving through San Augustine-the often repeated seventy-five pounds a week, worth more than three million dollars-and the amount actually found during the raid. Two hundred agents making a lightning strike had turned up only five ounces of drugs.\n\nThe White Tornado defendants, for their part, could not seem to win for losing. Barely a week after the raid, it emerged that Dave Husband was now suspected of having buried the bodies of an undetermined number of undocumented Mexican workers on his land. Government bulldozers began turning acres of rolling pastureland along the Attoyac River into a vast open-pit mine while the press corps camped out under the trees. Husband had employed illegal Mexican labor for many years, and five undocumented workers had, in fact, been found in a trailer behind his liquor store during the drug raid. But the workers found in the trailer later signed a joint statement asserting that, contrary to press reports, they had not been beaten by Husband. And no bodies were ever found.\n\nThe number of defendants rose eventually to fifty-seven, and the guilty pleas began to flow in early August. Daryl Hale, Roger's son, was the first White Tornado defendant to agree to coöperate with prosecutors in exchange for reduced charges-a single count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. By the end of September, Blue Tick Edwards, Willie Earl Dade, Roger Hale, Edgar Price, Michael Bell, Ivan Aguirre (Aldon Aguirre was still at large), and more than a dozen others had pleaded out. Each time someone pleaded, the remaining defendants grew more nervous, for it meant another finger quite likely being pointed at them. Thus did the stampede build, to twenty and thirty and forty guilty pleas. By early 1990, Dave Husband and Lenard Jackson and their immediate families and associates were the only significant defendants left.\n\nBut the federal prosecutors still did not have the man they wanted: Nathan Tindall. Lenard Jackson and company probably knew nothing incriminating about Tindall, the prosecutors thought, and so the issue did not figure in the negotiations with them. Those negotiations finally resulted, in March, in guilty pleas that brought down sentences of fifteen years on Lenard (his wife, the former Girtha Mae Polley, did not live to see him go to prison: she had committed suicide in December) and ten years each on his brother Roy, his son Steven Kelly, and Harlon Kelly. (Because these are federal sentences, they contain no possibility of parole.)\n\nDave Husband was another matter. The prosecutors' first offer to Husband was five years, and the return of his liquor store, which had been confiscated. Husband, convinced that the evidence against him was weak, turned it down. As his fellow-defendants began to coöperate, agreeing to testify against him, the offers from the prosecutors got less generous. Finally, in September, Husband agreed to plead guilty and to coöperate with the government in exchange for a sentence of twelve years, the forfeiture of his store, and a dismissal of the charges against his son. Coöperating with the government meant telling investigators what he knew about Nathan Tindall.\n\nAnd then Husband's lawyer, Joseph C. Hawthorn, of Beaumont, made a colossal mistake. After coming to a verbal plea agreement with the prosecutors and with the federal judge, but before formalizing the agreement in court that afternoon, he let his client be debriefed by Stuart Platt, Zack Shelton, and Malcolm Bales, one of Platt's colleagues. In barely half an hour of conversation, Husband told the government the sum total of what he had on Tindall: nothing. \"And Tindall was it,\" Hawthorn says. \"He was our only bargaining chip.\" That afternoon, the judge changed his mind. Now he didn't like the sentence, and after a private conversation with Platt and Bales he rejected the plea agreement. Hawthorn's appeal to have the judge recused from the case was denied. And the government was no longer interested in any plea agreement with Husband.\n\nSix months later, on the day that his son was to enter a guilty plea, Husband, now frantic that his son, whom he had drafted into the drug business to begin with, might go to jail, made the government an extraordinary offer. He would plead guilty to every charge against him-eight felony counts-if they would just assure him that his son wouldn't go to jail. The prosecutors agreed immediately. And Dave Husband, who was then forty-four years old, was subsequently sentenced, under the mandatory minimums that attach to all federal drug violations, to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nExcept for its drastic incongruity among the punishments received by the other White Tornado defendants, Charles Mitchell has no problem with the sentence Dave Husband got. He has no problem, for that matter, with asking for the death sentence when a capital murder case comes his way. He does, however, have reservations about the way business is conducted in federal courts these days. \"The new evidentiary rules in these drug cases, allowing what would ordinarily be hearsay, and so forth, are pretty outrageous,\" he says. \"I mean, it's not much of a challenge to try a case when you're allowed to use evidence that would be inadmissible in a state court.\" And under such rules it's not much of a challenge to win guilty pleas from defendants once fellow-\ndefendants start testifying against them. Mitchell believes that in the Texas courts, which are where he does his prosecuting, most of the cases against the White Tornado defendants would have been much more difficult to win, for lack of evidence. And Dave Husband would have walked free after a state court sentenced his son Neil to ten years for possession with intent to deliver cocaine, in what even Mitchell, who prosecuted Neil, agreed was a subversion of Dave Husband's plea agreement with federal prosecutors. But when Husband's lawyer argued in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals that the plea agreement had been broken, the federal prosecutors contended that they had no control over state prosecutors; the judge agreed, and let Husband's life sentence stand.\n\nMitchell also had questions about the perennial federal investigation of Nathan Tindall. \"If they really believed that he was putting fines in his pocket, they just needed to send an agent up here driving drunk,\" he said. \"That's what I'd do. Buy him three or four quarts of beer, send him up here throwing bottles out the window. That would be pretty easy to clear up.\" With Tindall out of office, the feds were reduced, in Mitchell's view, to chasing shadows. \"I could get on that phone right now and say, 'Tindall's got a cow out here,' \" Mitchell told me. \"And they would figure out a federal crime he was committing and be on his butt.\"\n\nWhy are the federal authorities so intent on Tindall?\n\n\"Well, they want to do what's right,\" Mitchell said. \"If there's a dirty sheriff, they want to prosecute him. But, of course, sheriff's offices are also a fountainhead-or a cesspool, depending on how you look at it-of publicity.\"\n\nThe wave of publicity that accompanied Operation White Tornado left Mitchell unmoved, at best. \"It was all just media hype,\" he said. \"Lawyers in the square holding a pep rally-that borders on unethical behavior. Am I supposed to call a pep rally every time I go to try a murder case? Tell the world 'I'm going to cut out killing'? It would be popular, but it wouldn't mean very much.\" The raid itself had been a pointless display, in Mitchell's view, since of all the suspects only Dave Husband and Lenard Jackson could conceivably have fled prosecution. Routine arrests would have sufficed for everyone else.\n\nWithin the complex law-enforcement coalition that mounted Operation White Tornado, there were strains, inevitably, and after the drug raid they only got worse. The main point of contention was the division of spoils-who got what among the assets seized and ultimately forfeited. While Charles Bryan had been allowed to claim a major share of credit for the raid, his office was allotted just five per cent of the proceeds-the same amount that went to the San Augustine town police, and only a third of what the Liberty County sheriff's office received. According to federal officials, these allotments were determined by the actual contribution of each agency to the operation. Sheriff Bryan, who had evidently come to believe his own claims, was furious, and let the world know it, even vowing publicly not to let the F.B.I. back into San Augustine County. This was an empty threat, and federal officials responded by publicly announcing that the San Augustine sheriff's office had played no substantial role in Operation White Tornado, and by privately voicing scorn for Bryan's abilities, even suggesting that his incompetence had helped scuttle a post-raid investigation that might have netted major drug dealers in Houston. Eventually, the importance of the San Augustine drug trade was subtly downgraded by federal authorities. \"I like local law enforcement to think that\nthe biggest problems in the world are in their own back yard,\" Bob Wortham, the United States Attorney in Beaumont, told me. \"That way, they take things seriously.\" Stuart Platt, Wortham's chief assistant, said, \"You could do these types of cases in every town in East Texas.\"\n\nPost-raid squabbling also broke out in San Augustine itself. Curt Goetz, the mayor, designed a stone marker for the courthouse lawn to commemorate White Tornado, but Charles Bryan and Larry Saurage were outraged when they discovered that Goetz's own name would be chiselled near the top of the list of the heroes of the raid, just above the names of Charles Mitchell and Jack Nichols, the county judge-this despite the fact that Goetz, Mitchell, and Nichols had, by their own admission, not even known about the investigation until the raid occurred. And Larry Saurage's name was relegated to the bottom of Goetz's marker. Sheriff Bryan, who believes he is officially responsible for the courthouse lawn, made his objections known to Goetz. \"I told him just what I'd do if he put that thing up,\" Bryan told me. \"I said I'd wrap a chain around it, pull it out of the ground with my truck, drag it over to his house, and dump it in his front yard.\" The marker proposal was tabled for further consideration.\n\nSomehow, nearly all of White Tornado's principal characters managed to get together at a one-year anniversary celebration, dubbed Drug Independence Day, on the San Augustine courthouse square. Curt Goetz, Bob Wortham, Stuart Platt, and Zack Shelton all spoke, along with United States Representative Jim Chapman and Kenny Houston, of the National Football League's Hall of Fame. (Larry Saurage boycotted the celebration, though his name was on the program as a host.) Blackhawk helicopters from the United States Customs Service flew in for the day, and President Bush sent a telegram. Final success in the war on drugs was the consensus prediction. \"Our commitment to eliminating narcotics cannot be diluted,\" Representative Chapman proclaimed. Media coverage was enthusiastic.\n\nBut for those who read to the end of the list of nearly two hundred official invitees in the program for Drug Independence Day there was a small surprise waiting: \"N. L. Tindall.\" The disgraced ex-sheriff evidently still had some influential local supporters. While the federal authorities were still pursuing him-indeed, they were about to subpoena the records of his myriad land trades-he had still not been charged. After all the bad press he had received, and all the federal investigative attention, the fact that he was alive at all as a public figure seemed remarkable.\n\nIt even seemed to amaze the state police. More than a year after the anniversary celebration, I was talking to a group of state narcotics officers in Lufkin, and I mentioned that I had heard that Tindall was thinking about running for sheriff of San Augustine County again. There was a long, stunned silence. Finally, Ricky Allen, a huge, bearded undercover agent, spat tobacco juice into a can and said, \"Seems like Nathan survived a pretty hard little old punch over there.\" I had the impression that the other old narcs in the room were struggling not to smile.\n\nThe possibility that Tindall might rise from his political grave-and the likelihood of his resurrection seemed to grow with each passing week-posed an interesting question: Were San Augustinians somehow unhappy with the results of Operation White Tornado?\n\nCertainly the San Augustine economy had been pretty well flattened by the drug raid. The late Edward Clark, the county's leading banker, said, \"Money totally disappeared from this town after the drug bust. Stores that had been selling hundred-dollar hats, fifty-dollar shoes, their customers were just gone.\"\n\nEven more, perhaps, than businesses, poor families felt the raid's impact. Susan Ramsey, a social worker, said, \"Some of my clients did better after the raid. They stopped doing crack, and started getting their hair done. Later on, though, the financial repercussions began to be felt.\" Mary Warren, the county's welfare director, said, \"That bust just ruined the economy here. It's as simple as that. It increased our caseload directly.\"\n\nBut the economic blow delivered by the drug raid wasn't simply a matter of removing a few dozen free-spending cocaine dealers from the county. There was a more general chilling effect, according to many black residents. \"Like we used to have street jams out by my house,\" a teen-age logger told me. Street jams, he explained, were big parties, with music and dancing (but no drugs that he ever saw). \"Then, after the drug raid happened, we never had another one. People used to come over from Lufkin and Nacogdoches. Now ain't nobody interested in coming here.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't only black people who were put off San Augustine by the raid. At a restaurant called Raymond's, out in the woods north of town, a barmaid told me, \"This place used to be a gold mine. It was open seven nights a week.\" By the time I visited Raymond's, it was open two nights a week, and on the night I ate there I was the only patron. What happened? \"A drug bust happened,\" the barmaid said, making a sour face. She was a young, tousled-looking white woman, and Raymond's, I learned, was and always had been a segregated establishment: whites only. Had the former patrons all been drug dealers? \"Some of them was,\" the barmaid said. \"But none of them got arrested. Mostly, there was just a lot of money in circulation. Now San Augustine's like a ghost town. There's nothing for young people to do here. The old families that own this place don't want nothing to change. They won't let nothing come in here. And this new sheriff, he don't care about helping people, the way Nathan Tindall did.\"\n\nCharles Bryan grew up in the southern part of the county. He came to town as a teen-ager, went to work in a grocery store owned by his father and his uncle, and spent many years in the family grocery business and then in the meat business. Not known as an especially sharp businessman, he was unsubtly snubbed by self-made peers like Nathan Tindall and Dave Husband. \"He was raised with a little bit of a silver spoon\nin his mouth,\" Tindall says, sniffily. Bryan's hobby was raising and selling show horses. He and his wife belonged to the highly respectable First Baptist Church, whose members included some of the oldest families in San Augustine. Thus, when the town's Old Guard, long dissatisfied with Nathan Tindall's performance as sheriff, considered alternatives, Bryan was ready to hand. He had none of the natural politician's bonhomie, but he was solid and photogenic and, as the climax of Operation White Tornado proved to Betty Donatto, a surprisingly good actor.\n\nIn the day-to-day role of sheriff, however, he seemed a little uneasy, as if he weren't quite sure what to do next. When I dropped by his office in the jailhouse, he always seemed to have time to talk, and his mind was often on unofficial matters. One morning, I found him studying a jar of epoxy on his desk. \"Horse bit my car,\" he explained.\n\n\"This Larry Saurage's town now.\" Thus Sarah Oliphant, who once let Saurage's agent Betty Donatto befriend her, and spent a year in prison as a result. Oliphant was now back in San Augustine, living with her mother and her two sons in the Sunset Hills project, and she had the local power situation dead right. Chief Deputy Sheriff Saurage got higher pay than Sheriff Bryan himself, he had the power to hire and fire, and he made all the law-enforcement decisions that counted. On the street and in the jailhouse, Saurage was the Man.\n\nHe was in his late forties, and came originally from Beaumont, but had worked all over Texas and Louisiana as a lawman, a prison guard, and a telephone lineman. He was six feet tall and sandy-haired, with a wide, weather-lined face and an unusual, imposing build: barrel-chested and bullnecked but surprisingly light on his feet. His voice and his manner were rich with natural authority. When his deputies brought in a roaring-drunk driver, Saurage said firmly, \"Bennis, you're going to spend a few hours with me now,\" and all belligerence vanished and the prisoner was booked. Saurage's language was a mixture of police jargon and down-home vernacular. \"He ain't nothin' but an old snake head,\" he might say of a disliked lawyer, \"but we'll still dispose the case.\" Most of the sheriff's-department business seemed to find its way to Saurage's office, and the chief deputy, his cowboy boots propped comfortably on his desk, made no pretense of consulting with anyone as he delivered his instructions; he simply ordered the town judge to sentence a vandal to ten days, or the chief of police to pick up a suspected burglar. On one wall of his office was a framed plaque from the Police Officers' Hall of Fame, which Saurage had won in 1985 for his role in a homicide investigation down in Orange County. Taped to another wall was a bumper sticker reading, \"My Assault Rifle: 0, Teddy Kennedy's Car: 1.\"\n\nSaurage had brought an aura of big-city police work to San Augustine. He might hang out in the jailhouse on a balmy evening with the other deputies, park rangers, and highway patrolmen, chewing tobacco and talking coon dogs and squirrel dogs and where the bass were biting on Sam Rayburn Reservoir. But Saurage had been a cop in Houston and in Orange and Chambers Counties, and he did not let people forget it.\n\nHe had a big-city cop's respect for paperwork, in drastic contrast to Nathan Tindall's style of office management. He also brought to San Augustine his wide experience as a narcotics officer. After all, the war on drugs had been Charles Bryan's campaign platform, and hiring Saurage had been his one big strategic deployment. Saurage brought in undercover agents, turned suspects and prisoners into informers (\"snitches,\" he called them, with a fierce, musical pronunciation that was half affectionate and half contemptuous), and generally made life difficult for the local dopers and dealers.\n\nOne afternoon, I accompanied Saurage and some of his fellow-officers on an anti-drug operation. They brought a young black man down from an upstairs cell in the jailhouse, taped a remote microphone to his belly, and drove him to a spot behind the junior high school. On the ride through town, the young man lay down on the seat of the cruiser-to avoid being seen-and explained to me from there that he had just returned from six months in the state penitentiary, which was why he had agreed to snitch today. He darted into the woods behind the school, then made his way into the Sunset Hills housing project. We drove around to a vantage on U.S. 96, and watched him wander through the scatter of buildings, his microphone picking up garbled snatches of conversation, which we strained to hear on a walkie-talkie. \"It helps if you speak a little Swahili,\" a white patrolman told me. Saurage grimaced. \"It's a way of life,\" he said. \"Welfare, laying around smoking cocaine, having babies. I'll never understand it.\"\n\nThe informer gained entrance to an apartment, and apparently found a group of people smoking crack there. He tried to buy a rock but was told that the dealers, who were outside in a car, wouldn't sell to him, because they believed he was a snitch. He persisted, and eventually the woman who lived in the apartment went out, scored a rock, shaved off a piece for herself, and sold the remainder to the informer, for twenty dollars. We drove back around to the school, and soon the informer emerged from the woods, looking scared but triumphant. \"Got 'em,\" he said, handing over a small, yellowish rock.\n\nHalf an hour later, armed with a search warrant, a patrolman kicked in the door of the apartment where the informer had bought the dope. Inside, four startled women, including Sarah Oliphant, silently raised their hands. They were sitting on a couch watching cartoons on TV: Woody Woodpecker, Daffy Duck. There was no dope in sight. John Matthew Cartwright, now the chief of police, went to search the bedrooms. One of the women on the couch-heavyset, middle-aged, wearing a pink sweatshirt-curled her lip. \"Can't go visitin' no more,\" she said. \"Law gonna kick the door down.\" The apartment's resident, a sallow, middle-aged woman named Beulah, found her voice. \"What's this all about?\" she said.\n\n\"Larry be here in a minute,\" Cartwright said. \"He'll tell you.\"\n\nSaurage, who had been detained by jailhouse business, soon showed up. \"Hoo-wee,\" he said, pointing at Oliphant and shaking his head. \"What we got here?\"\n\n\"Hi, Larry,\" Oliphant said.\n\nSaurage took Beulah off to a bedroom to talk.\n\nThe apartment search turned up no drugs, but a crack pipe was found in Beulah's pocket and confiscated. The four women were let off with a stern warning from Saurage and, in Beulah's case, a broken door, a charge of delivering cocaine, and an agreement to give a statement against the dealers who had sold her the crack. The dealers-four young black men-were found hanging out at a car wash up on U.S. 96. There were no drugs on them, either, but one of them, Rodriguez Hill, had thirty-four dollar bills in his pocket, along with a scribbled list of names and dollar amounts. Hill was arrested and booked for driving without a license and for driving without a seat belt.\n\n\"You seen 'New Jack City'?\" Saurage asked me later. \"Good. Because that's exactly what we got here. It's the American Dream, except it's a nightmare.\"\n\nSan Augustine didn't really resemble the apocalyptic Harlem of \"New Jack City,\" I thought, but Rodriguez Hill might have relished the idea that it did. He was twenty-one, beefy, and mad as a snake, and was wearing a little denim fishing cap. At the jailhouse, he glared at me with narrowed eyes. After I told him I was a journalist, his attitude changed abruptly. He was actually from Louisiana, he said, but had been raised in San Augustine. \"You say you from New York?\" He seemed impressed. \"Hey, up there they don't fuck around. Law gets in their face, they shoot 'em dead. They play for real. We fixin' to start doin' the same thing 'round here. People sick and tired of the law jumpin' on 'em all the time.\"\n\nRodriguez Hill was allowed a phone call, and he used it to try to raise his bond, set at two hundred and sixty-five dollars. I went back to Saurage's office, and found him listening in on an extension. He put a finger to his lips; he was taking notes. It seemed that Hill was calling someone in Center whom Saurage believed to be his drug connection.\n\nAfter the call, Hill was put in a ground-floor holding cell at the back of the jailhouse. He immediately started shouting up the stairs to the prisoners in the long-term cells on the second floor, accusing a man he assumed had led the police to him. The prisoners called back that he was mistaken. \"We know the motherfucker done did it,\" one yelled. \"We seen him go off from here!\" The real informer's name was bellowed repeatedly.\n\nLarry Saurage eventually went back and interrupted this colloquy. He reminded Hill that he was out on bond on another charge, glared at him until he dropped his gaze to the floor, and then returned to his office, shaking his head.\n\nMaybe San Augustine wasn't New Jack City, but the rising national tide of violent crime, much of it drug-related, was definitely finding its way into the piney woods. At an Exxon station on U.S. 96, I was surprised to find the attendant sitting behind inch-thick, bulletproof glass and making change through a steel trough. Such security struck me as needlessly serious and urban until one Sunday afternoon when a local crackhead persuaded the attendant to open the booth's door to hand him an oilcan. He hit her on the head with a rock, sending her to the hospital, and robbed her. (When he fled, however, he was chased and caught by two local men; and three days later, after pleading guilty to aggravated robbery, he was sentenced in state district court to fifty years.)\n\nAn ominous escalation was also taking place in local law enforcement, and shortly before I arrived in town it had produced a tragedy. It happened on a Saturday night when a number of \"homecomings\"-family gatherings, usually held in the fall, when far-flung relatives return to their rural homesteads and churches-had filled black San Augustine with people in a festive mood. After the taverns closed, people lingered outside one of them, continuing the party. Richard Carl Davis, a black patrolman, arrived, and found himself in a confrontation with Varron (Bo) Lane, also black, and twenty-five and drunk and armed with a .22 rifle. Davis pointed his shotgun at Lane's chest and ordered him to lay down the .22. Lane did so, and then, unarmed, he advanced on Davis. Davis pulled the trigger, killing him with a single blast to the chest.\n\nThough many black San Augustinians were outraged by the killing of Bo Lane, a local grand jury declined to indict Davis. On the evening after the grand jury made that decision, I happened to encounter one of its members at Sheriff Bryan's house. White, and in late middle age, she was a member of the town's Old Guard (\"We been here since 1853,\" she informed me), and her sister was also visiting Sheriff Bryan. The grand juror made it clear that she wouldn't have dreamed of indicting Davis. She owned a police scanner radio and loved to listen to it at home-her sister had one, too-and Richard Carl Davis, she said, \"is just so cute on there sometimes.\" I probably didn't understand, she said, what the police had to deal with in San Augustine. \"People who don't associate with that one particular segment that's always causing trouble or don't have a scanner just aren't aware of what's going on. It takes constant effort and time to keep this element down.\"\n\nSheriff Bryan and his wife agreed that it was so.\n\nSome time later, I happened to visit the grand juror shortly after seeing Richard Carl Davis brandish an assault rifle at a panic-stricken crowd during a high-school basketball game. I mentioned the incident. \"Well, have you ever been around blacks before?\" she asked. \"They like authority. They like somebody to have more power. You have to do that with them. Richard Carl was the one killed that Lane nigger.\"\n\nNathan Tindall's bid to rise from the political grave became official in January, 1992, when he announced his intention of running for sheriff in the Democratic primary-the only election that matters in San Augustine-in March. And the ensuing sheriff's race soon became a sort of referendum on Operation White Tornado. Charles Bryan made it so by again designating \"drugs\" as the central theme of his campaign and by constantly bringing up his own participation in the famous raid. Though the names of Dave Husband, Willie Earl Dade, and other former Tindall cronies now sitting in federal prisons never appeared on Bryan's campaign flyers, they loomed behind his darker suggestions about his opponent. And their weight in the electoral balance was unknown. Tindall, for his part, refused to denounce Husband or his former chief deputy, insisting that Dade had gone into the drug trade only after he left the sheriff's office and found himself ill, broke, and unemployed, and publicly doubting the strength of the evidence against Husband.\n\nBryan himself had had various dealings with Husband, it seemed; he had, for instance, sold Husband the land where his liquor store stood. He had traded with other White Tornado defendants, too. Michael Bell-the young king of the Sunset Hills project, who had never held a job since high school-had bought a brace of expensive show horses from Bryan. Even before the drug raid, some of these transactions had raised eyebrows: people wondered where Bryan imagined that Bell had come by all his discretionary thousands. And after Bryan took office Bell apparently started bragging that he enjoyed the sheriff's protection, pointing to the horses as evidence. While there was almost surely nothing to this claim, and nothing untoward about Bryan's dealings with Husband, either, such convergences showed how closely interwoven most lives were in a place as small and isolated as San Augustine. Outsiders often made more of these relationships than they merited.\n\nBut this was another level of the race: local experience, the county's self-understanding, contending with powerful but remote judgments-with a federally endorsed array of heavily coded drug-war imagery.\n\nThe drug problem in San Augustine was real-even if, taking the long view, Tindall reckoned that alcohol had caused far more trouble-and the pressure that Larry Saurage and his troops put on local dealers and their customers gave concrete expression to Sheriff Bryan's overriding concern. But the \"drugs\" theme had as much symbolic as real significance. In the lexicon of many whites, it was code for lawless blacks, and evoked a great range of criminal stereotypes, from the hapless and desperate addict to the fiendish, nouveau-riche pusher. It represented everything that threatened people's children and-for some people, both black and white-everything that had gone wrong with the modern world. Paradoxically, White Tornado had seemed to connect little San Augustine with the modern world, the world that most of the people there saw only through their TV satellite dishes.\n\nMost of the voters in San Augustine County-at least two-thirds of them-were white. And the big unspoken issue for white voters in the sheriff's race, according to whites on both sides whom I spoke with, was (and nearly always had been, historically) black people and how to control them. \"A lot of white people supported Nathan Tindall down the years just because they believed he kept the blacks in line,\" an elderly white woman-a vociferous supporter of Charles Bryan-told me. Her sister, also a Bryan supporter, said, \"Truth is, the blacks pretty much had the run of the county when Nathan was in office. They behave better under Charles.\"\n\nActually, everybody knew that it wasn't up to Charles Bryan to make black people \"behave\"; it was up to Larry Saurage. And there was much debate about whether local black people \"respected\" Saurage or only feared him. Tindall supporters-who turned out, as the campaign neared its end, to include virtually everyone who held elected office around the courthouse, including the county judge, the county attorney, the town attorney, the district attorney, and the district clerk-generally believed that Saurage had done nothing but alienate black San Augustinians. \"The black community is really disgruntled about the way they've been treated,\" Joanna Johnson, the district clerk, told me. \"Just because they're black doesn't mean they're automatically criminals. Every person that's arrested, he's got a family out there.\" As in the cities, there was a deep, irrational fear among whites in San Augustine of a violent rebellion by blacks. \"If you just keep pushing 'em, putting pressure on their little clubs and what have you, trying to shut 'em down, there's gonna be-well, I don't want to call it a riot, but let's just say a lot of hard feelings,\" Joanna Johnson said. \"People who go out to these joints at night, they respect Nathan Tindall. They'll mind him. They don't feel like they're having something put on them all the time. They don't respect this sheriff.\" She meant Charles Bryan.\n\nThe big white churches in town-Baptist, Methodist, Church of Christ-were all backing Bryan. Everyone, including Bryan, said so. What that would mean in the election, however, nobody knew. There were no official endorsements from the pulpit, no rock-solid white voting blocs, and no tracking polls; and most people, black and white, were wary of saying publicly whom they supported. Sam Malone said, \"There's an old-family, white-supremacist element here, but it's damn hard to put your finger on it.\" There were also what Malone called \"redneck do-gooders\" among the town's Old Guard-these were the more conservative members of the big white churches, and they were all Bryan supporters.\n\nBut it was here that the race issue began to blur into the class issue. \"There's an older group that sees Nathan and Dave Husband in the same category-as low-class farm kids who can deal with other low-class folks, like blacks,\" John Mitchell, the local judge, said. \"Because Nathan employed a lot of the same guys he arrested, he came to be seen as pro-black, pro-lower-class.\" Tindall was, in other words, still \"the nigger sheriff\" to many whites.\n\nElection Day was cold and sunny, with a sharp breeze shaking the new leaves on the pin oaks. It was Super Tuesday across the South, but Clinton and Tsongas signs were rare sights around San Augustine; instead, it was \"Bryan for Sheriff\" hand-painted on the windows of the gun shop on U.S. 96 and \"Elect N. L. Tindall\" nailed to the tree trunks along the farm-to-market roads.\n\nIn the courthouse square, a huge chalkboard had been set up. The names of all the candidates, from the Democratic Presidential hopefuls to the would-be constables of the county precincts, had been carefully written in. As the only countywide race being contested, the sheriff's column, with spaces for returns from each of the county's eleven precincts, took up most of the chalkboard. After sundown, a shivering crowd began to gather, collecting ten deep before the brightly lit chalkboard.\n\nThe throng was predominantly white, but I spotted Laverne Clark, who was the Reverend Cecil Clark's wife and one of Roger Hale's cousins, and I went and stood with her and a small group of other middle-aged black women. One of the women, heavyset and merry-faced-and the mother, I realized when we were introduced, of the hapless young man who had carried a hidden microphone into the Sunset Hills project on the day I accompanied Larry Saurage and his men on a drug raid-was amusing her companions with a raucous running commentary on the election.\n\nThere was a potent racial element to this election, clearly, and the people around us were being, I thought, conspicuously quiet about the sheriff's race. They talked instead about the Presidential primary, where Bill Clinton was cleaning up his competition. Our fearless commentator snorted. \"I don't care about that,\" she said. She pointed to the right-hand side of the chalkboard, where votes for sheriff were being tabulated. \"I care about this.\" Appreciative chuckles rose around us from both blacks and whites.\n\nThe results from the precincts began to arrive, and each was solemnly inscribed on the chalkboard. Though the black precincts had voted overwhelmingly for Tindall, it soon became apparent, as the results from the southern part of the county came in, that Bryan was going to win. Our merry interpreter's commentary darkened. \"Uh- uh,\" she said. \"He gonna really whup us now. Gonna send every black boy to the pen who ain't already there.\" She turned to me. \"You lucky, you live in New York. He gonna whup us. Four more years!\" The other women in our little group were laughing helplessly now. Laverne Clark, who was hiding her face inside a silvery flowered shawl, was laughing so hard she sounded half delirious. \"You laugh, girl,\" her friend scolded her. \"I ain't goin' outta my house for the next four years!\"\n\nVoter turnout had been, for San Augustine, unusually low-only sixty per cent. It had been especially low, people said, among black voters-a fact that presumably contributed to Tindall's crushing defeat. He had received only forty-one per cent of the vote.\n\nMany of Tindall's supporters were grasping for explanations, shocked by the magnitude of his loss. His black supporters, in particular, had been quite unprepared for it, since virtually no one in the black community had had a good word to say about Charles Bryan.\n\nI stopped by Charles Mitchell's office, and found the district attorney in a subdued, reflective mood. \"Nathan's losing is part of something bigger that's happening,\" he said. \"East Texas is moving away from the old-timey sheriff. It's happening in other counties, too-Shelby, Jasper, Nacogdoches. Used to be you had a skunk under your house, a fight with your wife-hell, if your house was on fire -you called the sheriff. And that's the kind of sheriff Nathan Tindall was, and what he was offering people. But it's not what most of 'em want anymore. Now various police agencies handle things. I guess it's the passing of an era. Some people still prefer the old-timey sheriff, though.\" Mitchell sighed. \"I might be an example of such a person.\"\n\nI briefly saw Tindall himself late that afternoon, at the car lot on U.S. 96. He was just pulling out of the lot, headed somewhere in a grubby Buick, and his eyes were red in the low sun. \"I didn't want the job,\" he said, his voice as gustily confident as ever. \"Other people wanted me back in there. I just wanted to help people.\" With that, he roared off.\n\nLarry Saurage, surprisingly, said he was disappointed. \"Why am I disappointed? Because one thousand five hundred and ninety-nine people voted for Tindall,\" he explained. The only good part, he said, was that the feds still might indict Tindall for money laundering at the bank where he'd worked. We were in Saurage's office; his boots were up on the desk. Watching him stew, I understood better than I had before why people were so nervous about being on the losing side of a sheriff's election. \"I stayed away from town last night for a reason,\" he said. \"Because if we'd lost I'd have got in a fistfight for sure.\" He shook his head angrily. \"After all the work Betty Donatto came in here and did.\"\n\nAs it happened, Saurage-and the world-saw what Betty Donatto had come into San Augustine and done quite differently from the way Donatto herself saw it. The longer she had spent in San Augustine, the more mystified she became about what, exactly, state and federal law enforcement was doing there.\n\n\"At first, it made sense,\" she told me when we talked in Houston. \"The feds said, 'People here in San Augustine are fed up-they want something done about the drugs now.' But after I got to know the scene, and saw how small it was, things stopped making sense. The problem was, the feds were trying to make it seem like more than it was. The quantities were all wrong. In fact, when they yanked the string I was upset, because I only needed a couple more months to really figure out what was going on. But then I decided that maybe they didn't want me to see that there weren't seventy-five pounds coming up from Houston every week.\"\n\nDonatto was silent for a minute or more. I knew that she had been working lately on international smuggling cases for the Houston narcotics squad. She knew the difference between large and small drug shipments.\n\n\"It's all politics,\" she went on. \"Sticks and stats, that's what we say-arrests and big numbers. There's so much money available for drug programs now, and every region wants that money, so they put you out there, telling you to get those sticks and stats. Liberty County loaned me out, and we made big bucks on my seizures. We got a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars just for my work. But what did we really do ? I went back to San Augustine for that one-year celebration they had. I was kind of scared to go back. I mean, they'd built it up so much, and built up my part in it, and people's families could have been really mad at me. So I didn't go up on the stage. I just stood in the crowd with a hat on, and sunglasses, while Malcolm\"-Malcolm Bales, the assistant federal prosecutor from Beaumont-\"accepted an award for me. Then I just snuck off, and on the drive home I just cried, all the way back to Liberty County. It just seemed so, so . . . I mean, all these people got promotions and raises, and what had we done ? Here they were celebrating, with all the politicians, and a barbecue at the sheriff's house, and everything else, and, unless I really missed something, there just wasn't that much dope there . Thinking about those heavy sentences, and all those families we'd hurt . . . I tell you, the more you get into narcotics on the law side, the more you see the politics.\"\n\nI had heard that Donatto, after her performance in Operation White Tornado, had been offered a job by the F.B.I. When I asked her about it, she said, after a moment, that she had decided not to pursue it. As a matter of fact, she said, she had pretty much decided to get out of law enforcement altogether. She was taking night courses, hoping to start a new career, as a drug-rehabilitation counsellor. \"It just seems like a better way to help people,\" she said. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Trump administration is waging war on diversity\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nFor decades, politicians at least paid lip service to diversity. Then Trump came along.\n\nby Dara Lind\n\nStephen Miller stood in front of a gaggle of reporters this week and declared that \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\" was an embarrassing footnote in American history.\n\nHe was talking about the White House's push on the RAISE Act, a bill that would cut legal immigration to the US in half over the next decade (mostly by slashing family-based immigration and ending the country's \"diversity visa\" lottery). This was part of an effort by the White House, as John Cornyn said, to reopen a national conversation about legal immigration - specifically, to introduce the possibility that it might in fact be bad in current quantities.\n\nThe White House also recently held a press conference to talk about how Central American immigrants are feeding into the gang MS-13: that they rape and murder people instead of assimilating, that they are criminals who have taken over America's streets.\n\nThese aren't just messages being sent from the White House, a \"Too Much Immigration Is Bad\" week along the lines of \"Infrastructure Week\" and \"American Heroes Week.\" They're messages sent throughout the Trump administration - and sometimes, the tiniest changes are the most revealing ones.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, the Trump administration quietly changed the name of a grant given by US Citizenship and Immigration Services to local organizations from \"Citizenship and Integration\" to \"Citizenship and Assimilation.\"\n\nThe small tweak was a shot across the bow. It's a declaration of who should be considered fully American: not just putting down roots in a community, becoming integrated into its economy and civic life, but assimilating - sloughing off something of one's ancestral culture to take on something American instead.\n\nThe Trump administration is reopening a conversation much bigger than \"how many immigrants should the US admit.\" It's reintroducing the idea that diversity itself might not be a good thing for America. In Trump's America, diversity has rendered swaths of the country unrecognizable and even hostile to longtime Americans - largely the white voters who make up Trump's base. Not only do they want to take their country back, but they are anxious never to \"lose\" it again.\n\nFor the past several decades, diversity has been something that both sides of the political aisle at least paid lip service to.\n\nNot everyone saw diversity as something worth pursuing for its own sake, to be sure - hence constant debates over \"affirmative action\" versus \"meritocracy.\"\n\nBut the idea of diversity, in and of itself, wasn't a wedge issue. It was a value that everyone claimed to uphold, and some simply doubted the strength of others' commitment to it.\n\nThose who believed that diversity was a threat to the American way of life - an intrusion of foreign cultures, strange religions, and alien ideas - didn't find any quarter for that belief in polite company, mass media, or politics. Now, they have their champion. The idea of diversity itself is now back up for debate.\n\nThere was an obvious upside, for Republicans, in defanging diversity - turning it into a trope of apolitical, apple-pie Americana. Their base continued to be wary, at best, that newcomers to America strengthened the country. But their base was aging, and the younger generations of Americans, increasingly, took \"strength in diversity\" as a fact of life.\n\nCrucially, those younger generations were, themselves, more ethnically diverse than their elders. The factoid that \"America will become a majority-minority nation by 2050\" was more likely to be used as a talking point in political consultants' presentations about building coalitions than voiced as an anxiety by mainstream politicians. America was coming to diversity just as inevitably as diversity was coming to America, and worrying about it made you seem like not only a racist but a fool.\n\nBack when diversity was a settled question - at least in public - it was assumed that any politician (or company, or celebrity) would want people of different races, religions, and abilities highly placed at public events and featured in promotional campaigns. It was assumed that the president would do anodyne photo-ops like hosting a Ramadan break-fast - things that would both remind Muslims in the US that America agreed they were Americans, and remind non-Muslims that someone can be American while observing religious holidays and eating traditional foods. There was an interest in treating everyone as, if not yet fully American, Americanizable - and an awareness that maybe it would be America that would change to meet them, as much as the other way around.\n\nThere was an interest in portraying, and treating, no one as unassimilable. Trump has given those who worried immigrants might not integrate a voice - a powerful one.\n\nThe distinction between assimilation and integration - between the vision of America as a melting pot and America as a salad, to use the standard metaphors - might seem like nothing more than a difference of degree: how much someone should have to change to become American once arriving here.\n\nBut it's really a question of how diverse a country can be without breaking.\n\nWhat's really striking about the \"RAISE Act\" introduced in the Senate this week by Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and David Purdue (R-GA) and endorsed by the White House is that its authors characterize it as a \"shift\" away from family-based immigration and toward \"merit-based\" immigration. But the bill doesn't actually shift slots allocated for the former toward the latter; it simply slashes family-based immigration, while leaving merit-based immigration flat, so that merit-based immigration becomes more common than family-based immigration by default.\n\nBy doing this, the bill wouldn't just be an unprecedented cut to legal immigration. It would make the very \"merit-based\" immigrants it claims to welcome less likely to want to stay because highly skilled immigrants often want to live with their families, too.\n\nIn theory, if America took integration as the goal of its immigration policy, it would encourage people to put down roots rather than coming to the US for a few years and leaving, or staying here without fully committing to citizenship. It would encourage their spouses to work, their children to attend US schools and learn English (and perhaps be cared for by members of the extended family when both parents are at work), their wages to stay in the American economy rather than being sent home in remittances.\n\nBut the worry at the core of \"chain migration\" is that at a certain mathematical tipping point, having an excess family member come renders the whole family less American (even if each family member has had to live in the US for a decade or longer before sending for anyone else).\n\nIf you believe that Americanness is brittle, you want to be damned sure the people you're bringing to America won't break it before you make too many commitments to let them stay.\n\nThe thing about assimilation, you see, is that the people most anxious about it tend to believe that there are some people who simply aren't assimilable - whether because they're not evolved enough (per early-20th-century eugenicists), or because their cultures and worldviews are simply irreconcilable with American views of freedom and achievement (per early-21st-century \"anti-Sharia\" activists).\n\nThis is the power of the old complaint that \"when my ancestors came to this country they learned English and worked hard, nowadays immigrants just don't bother.\" It's false on both counts. But it also lends itself well to the assumption that these supposed individual moral failings can be prevented by changing the way America selects immigrants as a whole - that you can predict which kinds of immigrants will and will not be willing to give up who they have been to become Americans.\n\nThis is a theme Trump has hit on anew lately. In his speech Friday on Long Island , he used it to characterize MS-13 gang violence as a failure of assimilation:\n\nYou say what happened to the old days where people came into this country, they worked and they worked and they worked and they had families and they paid taxes and they did all sorts of things, and their families got stronger and they were closely knit. We don't see that. Failure to enforce our immigration laws had predictable results. Drugs, gangs, and violence.\n\nTrump's rhetoric is powerful because it ties a specific problem of gang violence to a whole wave of migrants from Central America - deeming them all, to some extent, unassimilable.\n\nThere's no indication that it's true, any more than that it was true that the Mexican migrants of the last couple of decades were unassimilable, any more than it's true that Muslim Americans are unassimilable.\n\nFor his audience, though, it's very easy to take the high-profile incidents of \"aberrant\" behavior - especially when that behavior is an act of gruesome violence - and blow it up into a shared cultural value from a value system totally inimical to America's own, and one that its adherents will simply refuse to abandon.\n\nIt's easy because, in part, mass media is the primary way that this audience sees other groups. They're not on the border, and they (or their parents) left cities like Detroit long ago. Perhaps it's ironic that white people, who themselves retreated from pluralism en masse in the mid-20th-century - \"there goes the neighborhood\" - are now the ones believing that other spaces have been taken over by people alien or hostile to them, that there are now places in their own country they simply cannot go for fear of being targeted for violence.\n\nThe combination of not living quite close enough to people who are different, but living within close enough range to see things they might have done wrong on local news, is potent. It leads to absurd memes like the \"knockout game\" (the suburban legend that gangs of black teens were going around punching random white strangers in the head). It leads to fake news like European towns that have become \"no-go zones\" for non-Muslims. It leads to the US president saying that MS-13 has taken over whole cities in the US, and that the federal government needs to \"liberate\" those towns for its citizens.\n\nIf there are places that are simply forsaken to some Americans, places so alien to them that their very existence is a threat, diversity seems either already dead or not worth keeping alive.\n\nPluralism is a hard question. Of course it's a hard question. But when you look at a few hundred refugees on Manus Island and see the beginnings of an inevitable horde that will overflow your country, you lose any perspective on that question. You lose any faith in pluralism entirely. All you have, instead, is a desperate need to cling to an America you deem so fragile it can't bear one extra inch of stretch or ounce of weight.

      "text": "Go Set a Watchman: Why Harper Lee's new book is so controversial\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Dara Lind\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird is one of the best-known books in America. It's an inspiring story about standing up to injustice even if doing so is difficult and unpopular; an accessible coming-of-age tale; and a convenient way to teach high school English students about the Jim Crow South. It's also the only novel that its author, Harper Lee, had ever published - until a sudden announcement in February 2015 heralded the publication of Go Set a Watchman , a new Lee work featuring the same characters as To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nA lot of people are suspicious about the discovery of the new manuscript. There are questions about whether Lee actually wanted it to be published, or whether she even wrote it at all - and if so, when. These questions have only become more urgent since the book's release on July 14, due to its \"reveal\" that Atticus Finch, the anti-racist hero of To Kill a Mockingbird, is a virulent racist in Watchman.\n\nSo does America now need to exile To Kill a Mockingbird from its summer reading assignments? Or should readers continue to read Mockingbird as if Watchman had never existed? How you think about this, it turns out, depends on who you think is responsible for creating a novel's meaning - and how comfortable you are with America's complicated racial legacy.\n\nGo Set a Watchman is either the sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird , a rough draft of it, or something in between - it depends on whom you ask.\n\nUntil July 2015, Harper Lee had published only one novel: To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was an instant success when it was published in 1960; it was quickly made into an iconic 1962 movie starring Gregory Peck, and Lee, feeling the pressure to live up to her first book, never published another novel again.\n\nIn February 2015, a statement issued by Lee's publisher - purportedly on her behalf - announced that a manuscript had been \"discovered\" attached to another draft of Mockingbird. That manuscript was claimed to be Go Set a Watchman - the novel Lee initially submitted to editor Tay Hohoff, which ultimately became To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThe way the publisher tells it, Hohoff liked Lee's writing. But as Hugh Van Dusen, who's now Lee's editor at HarperCollins, said in an interview in February , Hohoff \"said to her, This isn't what you want to write ; you want to write something about Scout when she was a girl . \" Lee worked extensively with Hohoff to rewrite the book, and the result was To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nBut there's a lot of skepticism surrounding this account. The discovery was very sudden: Even Van Dusen hadn't heard about the discovered manuscript until just before it was announced. And after years and years of Lee saying she'd never publish again, it seemed very suspicious that she would have agreed to put out a new novel.\n\nLee suffered a stroke in 2007 , and she's currently suffering from dementia. It's not clear that she would be able to give informed consent about the publication of a new novel. The state of Alabama actually launched an elder-abuse investigation into Lee's situation earlier this year. It didn't find evidence of coercion or abuse, but it's impossible to rule them out with absolute certainty.\n\nHarper Lee in 2007. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty)\n\nIt seems all too plausible that lawyers could take advantage of Lee - especially for the sake of generating more profit for her estate. After all, the news of Go Set a Watchman 's release was a boon to the publishing industry: The novel would have a ready-made audience in the millions of Americans who read Mockingbird in school (it's routinely among the most-assigned books in high school English classrooms) or at least managed to crib together an understanding from SparkNotes and the Peck movie.\n\nAnd in the #BlackLivesMatter era, it was particularly timely to publish a follow-up to Mockingbird, which is remembered mostly as a civil rights classic. This is the secret to its staying power in classrooms. Its portrayal of the Jim Crow South is historically relevant. Its young protagonist gives students someone to relate to as she discovers how unjust her society is; Atticus Finch, the protagonist's father and a lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of rape, is a morally uplifting portrait of a just man confronting an unjust society. (It doesn't hurt that recollections of the book are often refracted through the Peck movie, which focuses on the book's racism plot.) Finch loses the trial, but the book makes it clear that what matters is that he stood up for what he believed in.\n\nSome critics suspect that the timing of a new novel from Lee was just too perfect - that Go Set a Watchman isn't actually a draft of To Kill a Mockingbird at all, but an attempted sequel pieced together by others. Adam Gopnik , writing at the New Yorker, makes the best argument in support of this:\n\nThe book as a book barely makes sense if you don't know \"Mockingbird.\" If \"Watchman\" is a first novel, even in draft, it is unlike any first novel this reader is aware of [...] It would not be surprising if this novel turns out to be a revised version of an early draft, returned to later, with an eye to writing the \"race novel\" that elsewhere Harper Lee has mentioned as an ambition.\n\nSo the controversy about what Go Set a Watchman really is isn't just a controversy over its history and how it came to be published. It's a controversy over who gets to decide what makes a book - and whether this book should change the way people understand To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThat's why the book's publication has sparked another controversy. While some parts of Go Set a Watchman are recognizable from Mockingbird - Quartz has a list of passages that survived the rewriting process pretty much intact - the plot and characters were totally transformed in the editing process that presumably turned one novel into the other.\n\nIn particular, reviewers have been horrified, and more than a little betrayed, to learn that the Atticus Finch of Go Set a Watchman is a vocal supporter of segregation. NPR reviewer Maureen Corrigan compared the change to \"turning Ahab into a whale-lover.\"\n\nATTICUS! How could you?!?? (Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty images)\n\nIt's ironic that the reception of Go Set a Watchman has been dominated by shock and dismay over the discovery that Atticus Finch is a racist, because the book is literally about Scout - who now goes by her given name, Jean Louise - making the same discovery.\n\nIt's important to remember that this book is set in the mid-1950s - in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education that ruled segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Jean Louise has been living in New York, and quietly assumed that her family back home is just as anti-segregationist as she is. Instead, she discovers that Atticus and her love interest, Henry Clinton, are both leading figures in Maycomb's Citizens' Council - local groups that sprang up to defend segregation. They're hostile (if not downright paranoid) toward the Supreme Court and the NAACP, which they worry are trying to incite the local black population. And Atticus, for his part, genuinely believes that African Americans are mentally childlike and unable to lead themselves or society. (Many reviews of Go Set a Watchman have made a big deal out of the revelation late in the book that at one point in the past Atticus had attended a Klan meeting, but that's eventually explained away. Atticus is portrayed as a virulent racist, but not as a Klan member in any meaningful way.)\n\nGo Set a Watchman is a portrait of a particular historical moment when the South knew it was under siege by the forces of integration, and suspected it had already lost, but hadn't yet been forced to accept that defeat. It can be bitterly funny, and also genuinely difficult to read. In one scene, Jean Louise visits her childhood cook Calpurnia and is alarmed to realize that Calpurnia is using her \"company manners\" - the exaggerated, servile dialect she puts on for white strangers. Jean Louise is distraught that the woman who raised her now just sees her as \"white folk,\" and asks Calpurnia directly: \"Do you hate us?\"\n\nBut thematically, Go Set a Watchman is literally about what happens once you realize Atticus Finch isn't the paradigm of civil rights you thought he was. It's the story of a young woman coming to terms with knowing that the father she had revered as a god is merely a man, and that the morals she thought she'd inherited wholesale from him are actually her own.\n\nJean Louise is an integrationist. Atticus is a legalist. He'll still take a case to represent a black defendant - in this case, one he knows to be guilty. But it's because he knows that he can secure a plea bargain, whereas if the NAACP represents the accused, it'll make a bigger deal out of the case.\n\nThat's a pretty accurate portrayal of one strain of Southern white liberalism, according to historian Kimberley Johnson of Barnard. According to Johnson, in the pre- Brown South, white liberals were relatively few. \"To go against this reigning ideology of white supremacy was super dangerous, not only politically but also financially,\" Johnson says. (In Go Set a Watchman , a character from a working-class background makes exactly this point; Jean Louise, from a solidly middle-class background, totally dismisses it.)\n\nAs a result, many white liberals were upper or middle class - and defined by that status. \"What made them liberal was an old-school gentility and also class,\" says Johnson. \"There was a certain percentage of Southerners who, while they might have agreed with the notion of keeping African Americans in their place, had a disdain for the crudeness of the KKK and the tacky people who were associated with it.\" That's Jean Louise's first reaction at the Maycomb Citizens' Council meeting: She's shocked to see Atticus sitting alongside people the Finches call \"trash.\"\n\nTo these liberals, things like lynching were an embarrassment. \"It made it look like the government wasn't actually in charge,\" Johnson says. They might have agreed about the inherent criminality of black people, but they wanted to uphold the rule of law even more.\n\nBut it doesn't feel that way. Because if Go Set a Watchman is a novel about disillusionment, does that mean that Atticus's heroism in To Kill a Mockingbird is the illusion?\n\nCan they really coexist? (John Lamparski/WireImage)\n\nSome critics argue that Go Set a Watchman introduces a useful complication to our understanding of To Kill a Mockingbird , because it points out that good people can believe bad things, and that people can do good things for bad reasons. Alyssa Rosenberg wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n\"Go Set a Watchman\" is part of the process of divesting ourselves of the idea that, as Ta-Nehisi Coates put it , \"we believe racism to be the property of the uniquely villainous and morally deformed, the ideology of trolls, gorgons and orcs.\" If racism can belong to Atticus Finch - and if it became his property through the same processes that made him a hero - it can belong to anyone.\n\nBut other critics have argued that the Atticus of To Kill A Mockingbird shouldn't be sullied by association with the Atticus of Go Set a Watchman. For one thing, in To Kill a Mockingbird, the adult Scout (who narrates the novel) reinforces the heroism of her father, as Albert Burneko wrote for Deadspin :\n\nPart of what makes Atticus such a powerful character is that, even though Narrator-Scout casts a gently ironic eye toward many of Kid-Scout's ways of understanding the world, Atticus, in both of their eyes, is a hero. This is a key to that novel, I think, or have always thought: Jean Louise changed and grew up, and her understanding of Atticus broadened and deepened, but her admiration remained, because he really was a hero.\n\nBurneko is making a literary-theory argument: that the answer to \"what is this character really like?\" is one only the reader can answer. Generations of readers have created their own ideas of what Atticus Finch is really like by reading, discussing, watching the Peck movie, etc. And the author can't take that away from them. As Burneko writes :\n\nIf Harper Lee is saying this Atticus is a Klan-rallying bigot-her lawyer would like us to believe she is, anyway-she might be wrong! She literally does not know him as well as you do . She knows him only slightly better than an absentee sperm donor knows the in-vitro-fertilized child raised by someone else.\n\nBut while \"the reader knows best\" is one answer to the question of \"what is Atticus really like?\" it's not the only answer. Another answer would be to take the publisher at its word and assume that Watchman is in large part an early draft of Mockingbird - which the Quartz article showing identical paragraphs seems to bear out - and ask what changed . Because the two versions of Atticus Finch aren't really the same person.\n\nLee has said that Atticus was based on her own father, a lawyer, so it's easy to assume that Atticus's morals must have been drawn from real life. But reading Go Set a Watchman makes it clear that the plot and characters of To Kill a Mockingbird weren't just drawn from life - they emerged during the editing process. Go Set a Watchman isn't just set several years after To Kill a Mockingbird - it actually portrays a different reality.\n\nThis Alabama courthouse performs scenes from To Kill a Mockingbird for visitors. This is about to get awkward. (G.M. Andrews/The Washington Post via Getty)\n\nGo Set a Watchman is set in a world where the crucial event in To Kill a Mockingbird didn't happen. In a flashback, Jean Louise remembers a case that readers recognize as the central trial in To Kill a Mockingbird : that of a black man with only one usable arm, charged with raping a white girl. But here's how the case is described in Go Set a Watchman (emphasis added) :\n\nAtticus took his career in his hands, made good use of a careless indictment, took his stand before a jury, and accomplished what was never before or afterwards accomplished in Maycomb County: he won an acquittal for a colored boy on a rape charge.\n\nIn other words, in the world of Go Set a Watchman, Atticus got Tom Robinson off.\n\nThis isn't a minor change. In To Kill a Mockingbird, the outcome of the trial is proof that the South is implacably racist - but that standing up for what's right is its own reward, and that it's something worth doing. In Go Set a Watchman, a sufficiently talented lawyer can actually persuade a white jury to acquit an innocent black defendant. That makes Maycomb look much better. But it also makes Atticus, who claims he's going along with the Citizens' Council in part to moderate them, look a lot more cowardly.\n\nIn Mockingbird, racism has a face in the trial of Tom Robinson: the monstrous Bob Ewell, who beats his daughter and later tries to kill Scout. There's no Bob Ewell in Watchman. The white woman who testifies for the prosecution is a 14-year-old, but the sex she had with the defendant was consensual - and since the defendant wasn't charged with statutory rape, this is enough to get the defendant acquitted. (Again, Atticus is a legalist.)\n\nIt's no wonder that, in contrast to the institutional racism of the jury in Tom Robinson's case and the individual villainy of Ewell, Atticus looks like a civil rights hero in T o Kill a Mockingbird. He's the only person in Maycomb who's willing to call out injustice when he sees it.\n\nIf the publisher is telling the truth now, at some point, as Lee worked with her editor, Hohoff, to turn Watchman into Mockingbird, the city of Maycomb was made to look worse - so that Atticus Finch could look better. But why? It would have been possible to refocus the book on Scout's childhood, or even on the trial, without altering the outcome.\n\nWe don't know for sure what Hohoff and Lee wanted from their book. But a New York Times article about Hohoff strongly implies that she wanted Mockingbird to be inspirational - and that she had an affinity for white liberal heroism. At the same time that Hohoff was editing Lee, she was writing a biography of a turn-of-the-century liberal crusader in New York, one whose ancestor was an abolitionist killed by a pro-slavery mob.\n\nSome critics have argued that it wasn't fair to print Go Set a Watchman as an independent work, any more so than it would be to go through your email drafts folder and hit send on whatever you find in there. This idea, too, has its roots in some form of literary theory: The \"real\" To Kill a Mockingbird didn't spring fully formed from the head of Harper Lee, it was created through a collaborative process with her editor, Hohoff.\n\nThe history certainly bears that out. But the editing process isn't just about creating a literary work. It's about creating a work for the literary market.\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird : stilllll popular. (Melanie Stetson Freeman/The Christian Science Monitor via Getty Images)\n\nIn the late 1950s, when working on Mockingbird , Hohoff and Lee appear to have come to the conclusion that a book about a heroic Southern white man was a better book and a better product than a book about a disillusioned Southern white woman. The success of Mockingbird confirms as much. So do plenty of other cultural depictions of the Jim Crow South, in which white protagonists standing up against the racism of white society get to be the heroes of their stories.\n\nThat's a comfortable moral position for white people: It lets them disdain white supremacy without feeling implicated in it. It's a less comfortable position for nonwhite people. When I asked Dr. Johnson, the Barnard historian, if she'd read Go Set a Watchman yet or planned to, she replied: \"I read To Kill a Mockingbird [in school], I was the only black person in my class, and it was a horrific experience.\" And while \"comfortable\" may be a good way to teach history and morality to high schoolers, it doesn't seem like the best way to confront the legacy of actual white supremacy.\n\nNo critic appears to like Go Set a Watchman as much as To Kill a Mockingbird, and many of them frankly hate it - in part, it appears, because of its bitterness. But it's hard to say how much of the critical ire is based on literary merit and how much of it is rooted in the fact that Mockingbird is a less uncomfortable book for white people to read. After all, another book that came out the same day as Go Set a Watchman - Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World and Me - is receiving some mixed reviews because it's presented as an homage to James Baldwin without doing enough to emphasize that things are better for black Americans now than they were in Baldwin's day.\n\nThe people who have rushed to pick up Between the World and Me don't appear to overlap much with the ones who are rushing to pick up Go Set a Watchman, because they don't remember Mockingbird as fondly. But the people who have raced to pick up Watchman have been thrown by the possibility that their hero isn't particularly heroic. As Jean Louise herself demonstrates in the book, that's not a bad thing.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

      "text": "White father and son charged for allegedly chasing and shooting at Black FedEx driver\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nFebruary 11, 2022 / 6:33 AM EST / CBS/AP\n\nAttorneys for a Black delivery driver are calling for a federal hate crimes probe of the attempted shooting of the driver in Mississippi, saying it's another example of Black Americans facing danger simply for going about their daily activities.\n\nThe FedEx driver, 24-year-old D'Monterrio   Gibson, was not wounded in the Jan. 24 incident. One of his attorneys, Carlos Moore, said Thursday that he believes police are not taking the investigation seriously. Two White men are facing charges, but Moore said the state needs to upgrade those charges to attempted murder.\n\nMoore said Gibson had done nothing wrong before two White men tried to stop him, with one of the men holding a gun.\n\n\"He was simply Black while working,\" Moore said during a news conference.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press on Thursday that the department received a request to look into the case and will review the request to determine any next steps.\n\nGibson said he was wearing a FedEx uniform and was driving an unmarked van that FedEx had rented when he dropped off a package at a house in south Mississippi. He said as he was leaving, he noticed a white pickup truck pulling away from another house on the same large lot.\n\nHe said the pickup driver tried to cut him off as he left the driveway. Gibson swerved around him and then encountered a second man who had a gun pointed at the van and was motioning for him to stop. Gibson said the man fired as he drove away, damaging the van and packages inside. He said the white pickup chased him to the interstate highway near Brookhaven before ending the pursuit.\n\nTwo white men from Brookhaven, 58-year-old Gregory Charles Case and his son 35-year-old Brandon Case, were arrested and released on Feb. 1. Police told local news outlets that the elder Case was the suspected pickup driver, while Brandon Case was the man in the street. Gregory Charles Case is charged with conspiracy. Brandon Case is charged with aggravated assault.\n\nThe attorneys who represent the men - Terrell Stubbs for the father and Dan Kitchens for the son - did not immediately respond to two phone messages that the AP left for each of them Thursday. A person in Stubbs' office said he was in court, and a person in Kitchens' office said he was out of the office.\n\nDuring a news conference on Thursday, Gibson said he was told by his superiors to run the same route the day after the chase, CBS affiliate WJTV reports .\n\n\"The following day, we had to go file a police report, and as soon as I was done filing a police report, they put me back on the same route. I did that for like a day or two until I started having real bad anxiety attacks, and I just couldn't do it anymore. I asked them for some time off, which I do have, but it's unpaid,\" said Gibson.\n\nIn a statement, FedEx said: \"FedEx takes situations of this nature very seriously, and we are shocked by this criminal act against our team member. ... The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we remain focused on his wellbeing. We will continue to support Mr. Gibson as we cooperate with investigating authorities.\"\n\nNobody was injured but the chase and gunfire have sparked social media complaints of racism in Brookhaven, about 55 miles south of the state capital, Jackson. The local NAACP chairman has called on city's Black police chief to resign, but the chief says he has no intention to do so.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere until God makes that decision,\" Kenneth  Collins told the Daily Leader . \"That's between me and God. Until God calls me I'm not worried about what anybody says.\"\n\nMoore compares the incident to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery , a 25-year-old Black man who was running empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision in 2020 when three white strangers chased him down and blasted him with a shotgun. The white men, including a father and son, were convicted of murder and sentenced to life. Defense lawyers said they suspected Arbery had committed crimes in their neighborhood, but prosecutors said there was no evidence of that. The three still face a federal hate crime trial.\n\nAbout 68% of Brookhaven's 12,000 residents are Black. The city is in Lincoln County, where District Attorney Dee Bates said information will be presented to a grand jury for a decision on charges once police complete their investigation of the Gibson incident. Witnesses, including Gibson, will be able to testify.\n\nJames A. Bryant II of Los Angeles, another of the attorneys representing Gibson, said Thursday that Gibson experiences pain knowing that people tried to harm him because he is Black.\n\n\"That has to be the most frightening experience one could face as a young Black man,\" Bryant said. \"And then not only that - they continued to chase him until they got to the freeway. So what would have happened if they were able to cut him off?\"\n\n© 2022 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

I asked them for some time off, which I do have, but it's unpaid,\" said Gibson.\n\nAfter FedEx allegedly halted his compensation, the company reinstated his pay, his attorney later told the station .\n\nAttorneys for Brandon and Gregory Case did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Cases were initially arrested in February and released after paying bonds on lesser charges. Lincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing said bond was set at $500,000 for the upgraded charges, according to the Brookhaven Daily Leader.\n\nMoore doesn't expect the case to go to trial until May 2023 at the earliest.\n\n© 2022 CBS Interactive Inc.

NPR's Rachel Martin talks with Code Switch blogger Gene Demby about media coverage of the activity.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. In the last few weeks, depending on what you're been watching or reading, you may have heard about the so-called knockout game. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST) MARTIN: And, again, depending on your source, you might have different feelings about it. You might be afraid to walk down a city street or you might have already decided the whole story is a hoax. NPR's Gene Demby is the lead blogger on the Code Switch team here at NPR. He's with us in the studio to help sort it out. Hi, Gene. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So, let's start off by just defining this. What is this thing called the knockout game? DEMBY: This is the way the knockout game is typically described. Some teenagers who are bored and looking to get into some trouble, point some hapless mark out on the street. They punch him or her as hard as possible in an attempt to knock them out. And then if they don't knock them out, they stomp that person until they're unconscious and then they run away. MARTIN: And the goal is not to rob someone. DEMBY: No. And there's also supposedly a social media component to it. These kids are attacking people and then uploading videos of these assaults to YouTube or Vine or some other video site like that. MARTIN: Is this really happening? DEMBY: There's a bunch of things we have to hold in our hands, right? The New York Times interviewed a (unintelligible) police chief who said that there's no evidence that this is a thing that's on the increase, although they would not rule it out. We also know that generally and for about two decades, violent crime, including assaults, have been going down. They've been sliding pretty dramatically. And there's not a lot of hard evidence that this is happening because we already have a name for this thing, We call them random street assaults. There's no way to distinguish between, say, a random street assault and what's supposedly an instance of the knockout game. MARTIN: Depending on what kind of media you are absorbing, that could be affecting your perception of what this is, this phenomenon? DEMBY: Right. The knockout game is, in a lot of tellings, a racialized game, in which young black men attack unsuspecting white people. There is a pretty sizeable part of the conservative blogosphere that has stumped for the existence of the knockout game for some time. Tom Flaherty, who works for World Net Daily, has catalogued what he sees as instances of the knockout game. And to be clear, there are kids who say they participated in games similar to this and they call it different things: the knockout game, point them out, knock them out, knockout king. MARTIN: And that is being blown out of proportion or that's being represented differently in different media? DEMBY: Depending on which media you consume, you get a very different story. One other thing that's important to note is that while people say this is on the rise, there are very few YouTube videos of this apparently happening, which is part of the phenomenon that we're supposedly - it's part of what's supposedly driving this trend. When you watch local news and you see coverage of the knockout game, you'll see the same security camera clips running over and over of kids attacking someone. But there isn't a lot of evidence of it happening online. MARTIN: And this is something you've been writing about on the Code Switch blog. And I understand you noticed something happening in the comment section of the blog that is instructive. Can you explain what you saw there? DEMBY: People have had experiences of being violently attacked randomly without apparent motivations around theft or robbery. These are really traumatic experiences. One commenter in particular talked about being actually in the area of the NPR building here and being assaulted as he walked down the street by a bunch of black teenagers. And he wanted to know what that was about. Why this happened to him. And he wanted the police to prosecute it and to look into it as part of a larger phenomenon. And that's part of the narrative question, right? It's the question about whether this is a thing that is happening... MARTIN: Is it a phenomenon? DEMBY: Is it a phenomenon and not just something we're treating differently because we have a name for it. MARTIN: What does a story like this, one that connects crime and race, what does it say about how we as individuals view crime, crime statistics, depending on our experience? DEMBY: It's really hard to separate our own traumas from larger social trends. How do you say to someone who has been assaulted on the street that this did not happen the way they perceived it to happen, right? If there's a general idea that young black men are unruly and criminal, right, then you can understand why people might extend a kind of credulousness to stories that may not have a lot of - they may be really specious, right. They may not have a lot of evidence to back them up as trends. MARTIN: But if it fits with your preconception... DEMBY: Right. And not just of young black men but of teenagers, right? If you turn on the local news and you see that teenagers are out of control and they're doing this thing on social media, you could understand why someone might say, oh my gosh, this is the thing that's happening and why they might look at the story skeptically. MARTIN: What's the lesson here? DEMBY: I guess it's more of a question: what do we gain by calling this thing the knockout game, right? What is the benefit in assigning this nomenclature to it? Why doesn't random street assault work, right? And that's the thing we should be thinking about. MARTIN: NPR's Gene Demby. He is the lead blogger at the NPR Code Switch team. Gene, thanks so much.

There is a pretty sizeable part of the conservative blogosphere that has stumped for the existence of the knockout game for some time. Tom Flaherty, who works for World Net Daily, has catalogued what he sees as instances of the knockout game. And to be clear, there are kids who say they participated in games similar to this and they call it different things: the knockout game, point them out, knock them out, knockout king. MARTIN: And that is being blown out of proportion or that's being represented differently in different media? DEMBY: Depending on which media you consume, you get a very different story. One other thing that's important to note is that while people say this is on the rise, there are very few YouTube videos of this apparently happening, which is part of the phenomenon that we're supposedly - it's part of what's supposedly driving this trend. When you watch local news and you see coverage of the knockout game, you'll see the same security camera clips running over and over of kids attacking someone. But there isn't a lot of evidence of it happening online. MARTIN: And this is something you've been writing about on the Code Switch blog. And I understand you noticed something happening in the comment section of the blog that is instructive. Can you explain what you saw there? DEMBY: People have had experiences of being violently attacked randomly without apparent motivations around theft or robbery. These are really traumatic experiences. One commenter in particular talked about being actually in the area of the NPR building here and being assaulted as he walked down the street by a bunch of black teenagers. And he wanted to know what that was about. Why this happened to him. And he wanted the police to prosecute it and to look into it as part of a larger phenomenon. And that's part of the narrative question, right? It's the question about whether this is a thing that is happening... MARTIN: Is it a phenomenon? DEMBY: Is it a phenomenon and not just something we're treating differently because we have a name for it. MARTIN: What does a story like this, one that connects crime and race, what does it say about how we as individuals view crime, crime statistics, depending on our experience? DEMBY: It's really hard to separate our own traumas from larger social trends. How do you say to someone who has been assaulted on the street that this did not happen the way they perceived it to happen, right? If there's a general idea that young black men are unruly and criminal, right, then you can understand why people might extend a kind of credulousness to stories that may not have a lot of - they may be really specious, right. They may not have a lot of evidence to back them up as trends. MARTIN: But if it fits with your preconception... DEMBY: Right. And not just of young black men but of teenagers, right? If you turn on the local news and you see that teenagers are out of control and they're doing this thing on social media, you could understand why someone might say, oh my gosh, this is the thing that's happening and why they might look at the story skeptically. MARTIN: What's the lesson here? DEMBY: I guess it's more of a question: what do we gain by calling this thing the knockout game, right? What is the benefit in assigning this nomenclature to it? Why doesn't random street assault work, right? And that's the thing we should be thinking about. MARTIN: NPR's Gene Demby. He is the lead blogger at the NPR Code Switch team. Gene, thanks so much.

He's with us in the studio to help sort it out. Hi, Gene. GENE DEMBY, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So, let's start off by just defining this. What is this thing called the knockout game? DEMBY: This is the way the knockout game is typically described. Some teenagers who are bored and looking to get into some trouble, point some hapless mark out on the street. They punch him or her as hard as possible in an attempt to knock them out. And then if they don't knock them out, they stomp that person until they're unconscious and then they run away. MARTIN: And the goal is not to rob someone. DEMBY: No. And there's also supposedly a social media component to it. These kids are attacking people and then uploading videos of these assaults to YouTube or Vine or some other video site like that. MARTIN: Is this really happening? DEMBY: There's a bunch of things we have to hold in our hands, right? The New York Times interviewed a (unintelligible) police chief who said that there's no evidence that this is a thing that's on the increase, although they would not rule it out. We also know that generally and for about two decades, violent crime, including assaults, have been going down. They've been sliding pretty dramatically. And there's not a lot of hard evidence that this is happening because we already have a name for this thing, We call them random street assaults. There's no way to distinguish between, say, a random street assault and what's supposedly an instance of the knockout game.

One other thing that's important to note is that while people say this is on the rise, there are very few YouTube videos of this apparently happening, which is part of the phenomenon that we're supposedly - it's part of what's supposedly driving this trend. When you watch local news and you see coverage of the knockout game, you'll see the same security camera clips running over and over of kids attacking someone. But there isn't a lot of evidence of it happening online. MARTIN: And this is something you've been writing about on the Code Switch blog. And I understand you noticed something happening in the comment section of the blog that is instructive. Can you explain what you saw there? DEMBY: People have had experiences of being violently attacked randomly without apparent motivations around theft or robbery. These are really traumatic experiences. One commenter in particular talked about being actually in the area of the NPR building here and being assaulted as he walked down the street by a bunch of black teenagers. And he wanted to know what that was about. Why this happened to him. And he wanted the police to prosecute it and to look into it as part of a larger phenomenon. And that's part of the narrative question, right? It's the question about whether this is a thing that is happening... MARTIN: Is it a phenomenon? DEMBY: Is it a phenomenon and not just something we're treating differently because we have a name for it. MARTIN: What does a story like this, one that connects crime and race, what does it say about how we as individuals view crime, crime statistics, depending on our experience? DEMBY: It's really hard to separate our own traumas from larger social trends. How do you say to someone who has been assaulted on the street that this did not happen the way they perceived it to happen, right? If there's a general idea that young black men are unruly and criminal, right, then you can understand why people might extend a kind of credulousness to stories that may not have a lot of - they may be really specious, right. They may not have a lot of evidence to back them up as trends. MARTIN: But if it fits with your preconception... DEMBY: Right. And not just of young black men but of teenagers, right? If you turn on the local news and you see that teenagers are out of control and they're doing this thing on social media, you could understand why someone might say, oh my gosh, this is the thing that's happening and why they might look at the story skeptically. MARTIN: What's the lesson here? DEMBY: I guess it's more of a question: what do we gain by calling this thing the knockout game, right? What is the benefit in assigning this nomenclature to it? Why doesn't random street assault work, right? And that's the thing we should be thinking about. MARTIN: NPR's Gene Demby. He is the lead blogger at the NPR Code Switch team. Gene, thanks so much.

Some teenagers who are bored and looking to get into some trouble, point some hapless mark out on the street. They punch him or her as hard as possible in an attempt to knock them out. And then if they don't knock them out, they stomp that person until they're unconscious and then they run away. MARTIN: And the goal is not to rob someone. DEMBY: No. And there's also supposedly a social media component to it. These kids are attacking people and then uploading videos of these assaults to YouTube or Vine or some other video site like that. MARTIN: Is this really happening? DEMBY: There's a bunch of things we have to hold in our hands, right? The New York Times interviewed a (unintelligible) police chief who said that there's no evidence that this is a thing that's on the increase, although they would not rule it out. We also know that generally and for about two decades, violent crime, including assaults, have been going down. They've been sliding pretty dramatically. And there's not a lot of hard evidence that this is happening because we already have a name for this thing, We call them random street assaults. There's no way to distinguish between, say, a random street assault and what's supposedly an instance of the knockout game. MARTIN: Depending on what kind of media you are absorbing, that could be affecting your perception of what this is, this phenomenon? DEMBY: Right. The knockout game is, in a lot of tellings, a racialized game, in which young black men attack unsuspecting white people. There is a pretty sizeable part of the conservative blogosphere that has stumped for the existence of the knockout game for some time. Tom Flaherty, who works for World Net Daily, has catalogued what he sees as instances of the knockout game.

The New York Times interviewed a (unintelligible) police chief who said that there's no evidence that this is a thing that's on the increase, although they would not rule it out. We also know that generally and for about two decades, violent crime, including assaults, have been going down. They've been sliding pretty dramatically. And there's not a lot of hard evidence that this is happening because we already have a name for this thing, We call them random street assaults. There's no way to distinguish between, say, a random street assault and what's supposedly an instance of the knockout game. MARTIN: Depending on what kind of media you are absorbing, that could be affecting your perception of what this is, this phenomenon? DEMBY: Right. The knockout game is, in a lot of tellings, a racialized game, in which young black men attack unsuspecting white people. There is a pretty sizeable part of the conservative blogosphere that has stumped for the existence of the knockout game for some time. Tom Flaherty, who works for World Net Daily, has catalogued what he sees as instances of the knockout game. And to be clear, there are kids who say they participated in games similar to this and they call it different things: the knockout game, point them out, knock them out, knockout king. MARTIN: And that is being blown out of proportion or that's being represented differently in different media? DEMBY: Depending on which media you consume, you get a very different story. One other thing that's important to note is that while people say this is on the rise, there are very few YouTube videos of this apparently happening, which is part of the phenomenon that we're supposedly - it's part of what's supposedly driving this trend. When you watch local news and you see coverage of the knockout game, you'll see the same security camera clips running over and over of kids attacking someone. But there isn't a lot of evidence of it happening online. MARTIN: And this is something you've been writing about on the Code Switch blog. And I understand you noticed something happening in the comment section of the blog that is instructive. Can you explain what you saw there? DEMBY: People have had experiences of being violently attacked randomly without apparent motivations around theft or robbery. These are really traumatic experiences. One commenter in particular talked about being actually in the area of the NPR building here and being assaulted as he walked down the street by a bunch of black teenagers. And he wanted to know what that was about. Why this happened to him. And he wanted the police to prosecute it and to look into it as part of a larger phenomenon. And that's part of the narrative question, right? It's the question about whether this is a thing that is happening... MARTIN: Is it a phenomenon? DEMBY: Is it a phenomenon and not just something we're treating differently because we have a name for it. MARTIN: What does a story like this, one that connects crime and race, what does it say about how we as individuals view crime, crime statistics, depending on our experience? DEMBY: It's really hard to separate our own traumas from larger social trends. How do you say to someone who has been assaulted on the street that this did not happen the way they perceived it to happen, right? If there's a general idea that young black men are unruly and criminal, right, then you can understand why people might extend a kind of credulousness to stories that may not have a lot of - they may be really specious, right. They may not have a lot of evidence to back them up as trends. MARTIN: But if it fits with your preconception... DEMBY: Right. And not just of young black men but of teenagers, right? If you turn on the local news and you see that teenagers are out of control and they're doing this thing on social media, you could understand why someone might say, oh my gosh, this is the thing that's happening and why they might look at the story skeptically. MARTIN: What's the lesson here? DEMBY: I guess it's more of a question: what do we gain by calling this thing the knockout game, right? What is the benefit in assigning this nomenclature to it? Why doesn't random street assault work, right? And that's the thing we should be thinking about. MARTIN: NPR's Gene Demby. He is the lead blogger at the NPR Code Switch team. Gene, thanks so much.

Why doesn't random street assault work, right? And that's the thing we should be thinking about. MARTIN: NPR's Gene Demby. He is the lead blogger at the NPR Code Switch team. Gene, thanks so much.

Audio on npr.org may be edited after its original broadcast or publication. The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nMARTIN: And that is being blown out of proportion or that's being represented differently in different media? DEMBY: Depending on which media you consume, you get a very different story. One other thing that's important to note is that while people say this is on the rise, there are very few YouTube videos of this apparently happening, which is part of the phenomenon that we're supposedly - it's part of what's supposedly driving this trend. When you watch local news and you see coverage of the knockout game, you'll see the same security camera clips running over and over of kids attacking someone. But there isn't a lot of evidence of it happening online. MARTIN: And this is something you've been writing about on the Code Switch blog. And I understand you noticed something happening in the comment section of the blog that is instructive. Can you explain what you saw there? DEMBY: People have had experiences of being violently attacked randomly without apparent motivations around theft or robbery. These are really traumatic experiences. One commenter in particular talked about being actually in the area of the NPR building here and being assaulted as he walked down the street by a bunch of black teenagers. And he wanted to know what that was about. Why this happened to him. And he wanted the police to prosecute it and to look into it as part of a larger phenomenon. And that's part of the narrative question, right? It's the question about whether this is a thing that is happening... MARTIN: Is it a phenomenon? DEMBY: Is it a phenomenon and not just something we're treating differently because we have a name for it. MARTIN: What does a story like this, one that connects crime and race, what does it say about how we as individuals view crime, crime statistics, depending on our experience? DEMBY: It's really hard to separate our own traumas from larger social trends. How do you say to someone who has been assaulted on the street that this did not happen the way they perceived it to happen, right? If there's a general idea that young black men are unruly and criminal, right, then you can understand why people might extend a kind of credulousness to stories that may not have a lot of - they may be really specious, right. They may not have a lot of evidence to back them up as trends. MARTIN: But if it fits with your preconception... DEMBY: Right. And not just of young black men but of teenagers, right?

If you turn on the local news and you see that teenagers are out of control and they're doing this thing on social media, you could understand why someone might say, oh my gosh, this is the thing that's happening and why they might look at the story skeptically. MARTIN: What's the lesson here? DEMBY: I guess it's more of a question: what do we gain by calling this thing the knockout game, right? What is the benefit in assigning this nomenclature to it? Why doesn't random street assault work, right? And that's the thing we should be thinking about. MARTIN: NPR's Gene Demby. He is the lead blogger at the NPR Code Switch team. Gene, thanks so much.

The trio suspected Arbery of recent break-ins.\n\nSCOTT SIMON, HOST: Testimony has begun in the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. He is the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year as he ran through a neighborhood. The defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. And the racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering that trial in Brunswick and joins us. Debbie, thanks for being with us. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Oh, glad to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Let's begin with the case that prosecutors laid out. What did they say? ELLIOTT: Well, during her opening statement, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood less than two miles from his house when three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. They grabbed their guns. They went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video, recorded by Bryan, that shows the end of the chase. Arbery's cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played that video for the jury. Ahmaud Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, wept watching it. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that was the first time she had seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER-JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened to Ahmaud on his last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom, where I was, and they also had a rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's part of this trial. SIMON: Debbie, how did the defense explain what jurors saw on that video? ELLIOTT: They painted a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins, and say Arbery was this scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night on a new home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney said he acted in self-defense. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with a shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck, and he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So, Scott, clearly two very different versions emerging here about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. SIMON: Debbie, testimony started late on Friday after 11 days of jury selection, a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man, covered in blood, seated over there, say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you hear there, dramatic testimony that first day, and it's set to resume Monday. SIMON: NPR's Debbie Elliott, thanks so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man, covered in blood, seated over there, say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you hear there, dramatic testimony that first day, and it's set to resume Monday.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nDEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Oh, glad to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Let's begin with the case that prosecutors laid out. What did they say? ELLIOTT: Well, during her opening statement, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood less than two miles from his house when three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. They grabbed their guns. They went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video, recorded by Bryan, that shows the end of the chase. Arbery's cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played that video for the jury. Ahmaud Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, wept watching it. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that was the first time she had seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER-JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened to Ahmaud on his last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom, where I was, and they also had a rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's part of this trial. SIMON: Debbie, how did the defense explain what jurors saw on that video? ELLIOTT: They painted a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins, and say Arbery was this scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night on a new home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney said he acted in self-defense. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with a shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck, and he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So, Scott, clearly two very different versions emerging here about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. SIMON: Debbie, testimony started late on Friday after 11 days of jury selection, a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street.

Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man, covered in blood, seated over there, say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you hear there, dramatic testimony that first day, and it's set to resume Monday. SIMON: NPR's Debbie Elliott, thanks so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened to Ahmaud on his last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom, where I was, and they also had a rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's part of this trial. SIMON: Debbie, how did the defense explain what jurors saw on that video? ELLIOTT: They painted a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins, and say Arbery was this scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night on a new home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney said he acted in self-defense. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with a shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck, and he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So, Scott, clearly two very different versions emerging here about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed.

      "text": "Rick Perry 'Brothers' Herman Cain And Sets Some Nerves On Edge\n\nBy\n\nFrank James\n\n\"Brother\" Herman Cain shakes hands with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2011. Isaac Brekken/AP hide caption\n\n\"Brother\" Herman Cain shakes hands with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2011.\n\n\"Brother\" Herman Cain shakes hands with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2011.\n\n\"Brother\" Herman Cain shakes hands with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2011.\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry likely didn't know when he twice referred to Herman Cain as \"brother\" during Tuesday night's debate that his attempt at easy camaraderie would set a lot of people's nerves on edge.\n\nBut he did.\n\nThat's because in the U.S. when a white man calls a black man \"brother\" and if they are not actually brothers (think adoption), or in a Greek-letter fraternity, or soldiers sharing a fighting position, indeed, if they are strangers or close to it, many a brotherized black man will immediately feel condescended to.\n\nIt may seem irrational. But, then, so is the notion that race based on skin color has intrinsic meaning. But that's another, much larger issue.\n\nIt may also seem unfair to the white person who may be attempting nothing more than kindly outreach to a stranger. But life's not fair.\n\nI have felt personally marginalized when addressed as \"brother\" by an unfamiliar white man in a setting where there was no proper context, like say, a shopping mall parking lot.\n\nIt's because the person saying \"brother\" is keying in on physical appearance.\n\nAnd by doing that, the white individual seems to be placing the black person in a compartment, the \"brother\" box. It seems like a not-so-subtle way of stereotyping.\n\nTo be sure, \"brother\" is a healthy improvement over the words that white strangers once routinely used to address black strangers, words like \"boy\" and the more infamous one once painted on a large flat rock at that Texas hunting camp Perry's family leased.\n\nEven so, \"brother\" dropped at the wrong time and in the wrong place can catch a black man up short. It should be noted as well that not only blacks found Perry's use of it jarring. Many whites did too.\n\nSome on Twitter have speculated that Perry, an evangelical Christian, might have referred to Cain as \"brother\" as \"in Christ.\" Cain is an ordained Baptist preacher. Maybe it was a Christian dog whistle.\n\nBut other candidates on the debate stage are well known for their Christian faith, Rep. Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, for instance. Perry didn't refer to them as \"brother\" or \"sister.\"\n\nIn a CNN interview , Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan said his candidate was merely a case of bonhomie:\n\n\"He is a friendly fellow. He uses that kind of language. And he views all those folks on stage as colleagues, as fellow Republicans, and he speaks accordingly,\" said communications director Ray Sullivan on CNN's \"American Morning.\"\n\nSullivan added that Perry called Romney the same term, but according to a review of the broadcast and transcripts, the folksy governor only directed the label towards Cain.\n\nCalls to the campaign asking when Perry referred to Romney as \"brother\" have not been returned.\n\nMaybe they're searching those self-same transcripts CNN examined.\n\nIf  nothing else, Perry's use of the word \"brother\" and the resultant fallout is just more evidence of how the nation's complex and difficult racial past has distorted \"the when\" and \"the how\" of even seemingly innocent acts and the way they're interpreted.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, HOST: As the crowd surged toward a stage, panicked and crushed people there for the sold-out Astroworld event at NRG Park. SIMON: We have the latest. I'm Scott Simon. KURTZLEBEN: I'm Danielle Kurtzleben, and this is UP FIRST from NPR News. At least eight people have died, and more than a dozen are hospitalized. Some 50,000 people were reported to be attending. SIMON: Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., a huge spending package on roads and bridges heads to the president's desk. KURTZLEBEN: While his other priorities, like early childhood education, clean energy and paid family leave, continue to be negotiated. SIMON: And video that shocked the nation gets played in the courtroom as three men stand trial in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. KURTZLEBEN: Stay with us. We've got the news you need to start your weekend. Authorities in Houston are saying what happened Friday night appears to have been a stampede. The crowd at NRG Park suddenly rushed forward during rapper Travis Scott's appearance at his Astroworld Festival. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto has more and joins us. Paul, thanks so much for being with us. PAUL DEBENEDETTO, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: What do we know so far? DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, HOST: As the crowd surged toward a stage, panicked and crushed people there for the sold-out Astroworld event at NRG Park. SIMON: We have the latest. I'm Scott Simon. KURTZLEBEN: I'm Danielle Kurtzleben, and this is UP FIRST from NPR News. At least eight people have died, and more than a dozen are hospitalized. Some 50,000 people were reported to be attending. SIMON: Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., a huge spending package on roads and bridges heads to the president's desk. KURTZLEBEN: While his other priorities, like early childhood education, clean energy and paid family leave, continue to be negotiated. SIMON: And video that shocked the nation gets played in the courtroom as three men stand trial in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. KURTZLEBEN: Stay with us. We've got the news you need to start your weekend. Authorities in Houston are saying what happened Friday night appears to have been a stampede. The crowd at NRG Park suddenly rushed forward during rapper Travis Scott's appearance at his Astroworld Festival. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto has more and joins us. Paul, thanks so much for being with us. PAUL DEBENEDETTO, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: What do we know so far? DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment.

KURTZLEBEN: While his other priorities, like early childhood education, clean energy and paid family leave, continue to be negotiated. SIMON: And video that shocked the nation gets played in the courtroom as three men stand trial in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. KURTZLEBEN: Stay with us. We've got the news you need to start your weekend. Authorities in Houston are saying what happened Friday night appears to have been a stampede. The crowd at NRG Park suddenly rushed forward during rapper Travis Scott's appearance at his Astroworld Festival. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto has more and joins us. Paul, thanks so much for being with us. PAUL DEBENEDETTO, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: What do we know so far? DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

SIMON: We have the latest. I'm Scott Simon. KURTZLEBEN: I'm Danielle Kurtzleben, and this is UP FIRST from NPR News. At least eight people have died, and more than a dozen are hospitalized. Some 50,000 people were reported to be attending. SIMON: Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., a huge spending package on roads and bridges heads to the president's desk. KURTZLEBEN: While his other priorities, like early childhood education, clean energy and paid family leave, continue to be negotiated. SIMON: And video that shocked the nation gets played in the courtroom as three men stand trial in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. KURTZLEBEN: Stay with us. We've got the news you need to start your weekend. Authorities in Houston are saying what happened Friday night appears to have been a stampede. The crowd at NRG Park suddenly rushed forward during rapper Travis Scott's appearance at his Astroworld Festival. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto has more and joins us. Paul, thanks so much for being with us. PAUL DEBENEDETTO, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: What do we know so far? DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom.

The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

At least eight people have died, and more than a dozen are hospitalized. Some 50,000 people were reported to be attending. SIMON: Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., a huge spending package on roads and bridges heads to the president's desk. KURTZLEBEN: While his other priorities, like early childhood education, clean energy and paid family leave, continue to be negotiated. SIMON: And video that shocked the nation gets played in the courtroom as three men stand trial in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. KURTZLEBEN: Stay with us. We've got the news you need to start your weekend. Authorities in Houston are saying what happened Friday night appears to have been a stampede. The crowd at NRG Park suddenly rushed forward during rapper Travis Scott's appearance at his Astroworld Festival. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto has more and joins us. Paul, thanks so much for being with us. PAUL DEBENEDETTO, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: What do we know so far? DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott.

People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

KURTZLEBEN: While his other priorities, like early childhood education, clean energy and paid family leave, continue to be negotiated. SIMON: And video that shocked the nation gets played in the courtroom as three men stand trial in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery. KURTZLEBEN: Stay with us. We've got the news you need to start your weekend. Authorities in Houston are saying what happened Friday night appears to have been a stampede. The crowd at NRG Park suddenly rushed forward during rapper Travis Scott's appearance at his Astroworld Festival. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto has more and joins us. Paul, thanks so much for being with us. PAUL DEBENEDETTO, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: What do we know so far? DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes.

NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

KURTZLEBEN: Stay with us. We've got the news you need to start your weekend. Authorities in Houston are saying what happened Friday night appears to have been a stampede. The crowd at NRG Park suddenly rushed forward during rapper Travis Scott's appearance at his Astroworld Festival. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto has more and joins us. Paul, thanks so much for being with us. PAUL DEBENEDETTO, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: What do we know so far? DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me.

The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

Authorities in Houston are saying what happened Friday night appears to have been a stampede. The crowd at NRG Park suddenly rushed forward during rapper Travis Scott's appearance at his Astroworld Festival. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto has more and joins us. Paul, thanks so much for being with us. PAUL DEBENEDETTO, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: What do we know so far? DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion.

SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

PAUL DEBENEDETTO, BYLINE: Thank you. SIMON: What do we know so far? DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information.

Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

DEBENEDETTO: Well, local officials say the crowd started to surge a little after 9 p.m. during a Travis Scott set, and the rush towards the stage caused a panic. People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people.

DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

People started to pass out and collapse. That caused more of a panic. And now at least eight people are dead, and more than a dozen are hospitalized, including 11 with a cardiac arrest. SIMON: Were there guards, paramedics, emergency personnel on hand? DEBENEDETTO: There were, actually. There were hundreds of police and security on hand. There was a local field hospital on the grounds that treated, throughout the day, about 300 people. But by the time this happened, Houston police and fire officials say that the rush just kind of came very suddenly, and they were quickly overwhelmed. SIMON: Any indication, Paul, about what caused that rush? DEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival?

Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nDEBENEDETTO: There isn't. And police and fire officials are stressing that they don't have all of the information yet. There have been rumors that have been swirling on social media. None of that has been verified. There is still, technically, no official cause of death for the people who died, and the medical examiner will make a final determination. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo - she's the top county official here. She said that among those injured were people as young as 10. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINA HIDALGO: Our focus right now is to support the families of any victims to make sure that we support them in identifying any victims, to make sure that we are conducting an investigation, not jumping into any conclusions. DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems.

It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

DEBENEDETTO: There is a reunification center at a nearby hotel. It's called the Wyndham Hotel. And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning.

And police and fire officials are asking anyone who hasn't been in contact with a loved one at the festival to head there. SIMON: How many people attended this festival? DEBENEDETTO: The estimates are about 50,000 people today. It was a two-day festival. This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

This morning, you could see a sort of surge of people. There was a video that was circulating of a surge of people that were breaking down the initial barriers to get in. It's a really popular event every year. Travis Scott took out a full wraparound ad on the cover of the Houston Chronicle yesterday. Other artists, like Bad Bunny and Earth, Wind & Fire are also scheduled to perform. But obviously, the rest of last night was canceled, and tonight's performances are also canceled. SIMON: Houston Public Media's Paul DeBenedetto, thanks so much for being with us. DEBENEDETTO: Thank you. SIMON: An infrastructure bill is headed to President Biden's desk after months of negotiation and just plain wrangling. Late last night, the House passed the $1 trillion measure, which includes significant investments in roads, rail and broadband. KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out.

KURTZLEBEN: And that was only after a long day and night of internal Democratic politicking. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had planned to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill the Senate approved this summer and a broader social spending bill. SIMON: But the speaker admitted she would have to delay action on the bigger bill while some members get detailed cost information. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NANCY PELOSI: Some members want more clarification or validation of numbers that have been put forth, that it's top-line, that it is fully paid for. And we honor that request. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh covers Congress and joins us now. Deirdre, thanks so much for being with us. DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan.

He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

DEIRDRE WALSH, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son.

KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nSIMON: One part, at least, to the president's agenda has gotten through the House. What's in the bill? WALSH: This is really a major accomplishment. Previous presidents have tried and failed to pass smaller infrastructure bill. This one has money for roads, bridges, broadband projects, water systems, airport upgrades. The Senate passed it in August, but progressive Democrats wanted to move it in tandem with that broader social spending package. This was actually Pelosi's third time she brought up the bill. This time, it turns out, third time was the charm. Thirteen Republicans backed it. Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care. Even though this was just one part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, it still has a lot of federal money going out the door for projects that are going to generate jobs and upgrade badly outdated transportation systems. This now heads to the president's desk for his signature. SIMON: What happens now to the rest of the president's plans, the ones that cost 1.75 trillion projected over the next decade? Is that in jeopardy of not passing? WALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning.

The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

Six Democrats voted no because they really wanted first to pass that broader spending bill on child care and health care.

And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nWALSH: Well, moderates and progressives in the House are really now coming together on that scaled-back bill. It was originally $3.5 trillion. The holdup yesterday on voting on that bill came down to five centrists, as we heard from Pelosi, who said they really want to see cost analysis before a vote. But Pelosi and other leaders sound confident they can pass it later this month. This process has been so messy. Last night, the president was making phone calls to bridge the divide between his own party. The House did advance a procedural vote, and they're going to bring it up later this month. But, you know, Democrats who lost the governor's race in Virginia this month feel the real sense of urgency to show they can actually deliver on their campaign promises. SIMON: Deirdre, what's in the broader bill? And would it, as constituted now, pass the Senate, where, of course, they need all 50 Democratic votes? WALSH: Right. And the wrangling's still going to continue. It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection.

It's half the original size, but it still has a wide range of programs for child care, health care, climate. House Democrats added four weeks of paid family leave, but that's something West Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin opposes, and it's likely to be stripped out. They also added immigration protections, work permits to allow those who are in the country now - who've been in the country now since 2011 to stay and not be deported, but those could also be stripped out. So even if the House does pass it, the Senate's going to change it. And that means the House will have to vote again. So it could be more weeks of wrangling between Democrats in the House and the Senate before something goes to Biden for him to sign into law. SIMON: NPR's Deirdre Walsh, thanks so much for being with us. WALSH: Thanks for having me. KURTZLEBEN: And for more policy and political maneuvering, check out the NPR Politics Podcast wherever you find your podcasts. SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

SIMON: Testimony's begun on the Georgia murder trial of three white men charged with killing Ahmaud Arbery. Here's the 25-year-old Black man who was shot to death last year. As he ran through a neighborhood, the defendants pursued him in pickup trucks. KURTZLEBEN: The racially charged trial has grabbed the nation's attention as a test case for racial justice. NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning.

They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

NPR's Debbie Elliott has been covering the trial in Brunswick and joins us now. Good morning, Debbie. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: Good morning. KURTZLEBEN: So can we start here with how prosecutors laid out this case? What have they been saying? ELLIOTT: During her opening statement Friday, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said Arbery was just jogging through a neighborhood. It was about two miles from his house when these three white strangers made the assumption that he must have done something wrong. So they grabbed their guns, got in their pickup trucks and went in pursuit. Now, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nNow, key to the state's case against Travis and Greg McMichael and William \"Roddie\" Bryan is graphic cellphone video recorded by Bryan that shows the end of the chase. Arbery is cornered, and then Travis McMichael shoots him in a struggle. She played the video for the jury. Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, wept as she watched it in the courtroom. Later, outside the courthouse on a blustery day, she said that this was the first time she'd seen the images that had galvanized so many to demand justice for Ahmaud. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) WANDA COOPER JONES: I avoided the video for the last 18 months. And I thought it was time to get familiar with what happened Ahmaud in the last minutes of his life. So I'm glad I was able to stay strong and stay in there. ELLIOTT: Other family members were in the overflow courtroom where I was. And they had a really rough time seeing that video and some of the other evidence that's going to be part of the trial. KURTZLEBEN: Well, that brings us to the defense. How did they begin to lay out their case? And in particular, how are they explaining what jurors see on that video? ELLIOTT: Right. That's their biggest obstacle. They paint a portrait of a neighborhood on edge, concerned about break-ins. They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning.

They portray Arbery as a scary mystery, an intruder who had been seen several times at night at a new-home construction site, quote, \"plundering around.\" Travis McMichael's attorney says he acted in self-defense after a legal attempt at a citizen's arrest gone wrong when he used a shotgun to kill Arbery. Franklin Hogue is Greg McMichael's lawyer. He described how things escalated after Arbery rejected the McMichaels' call for him to stop and started to fight back when Travis approached him with the shotgun. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) FRANKLIN HOGUE: Greg has turned as Ahmaud Arbery is running past the truck. And he sees him turn towards his only son. He's now in abject fear that he is about to witness his only son possibly be shot and killed in front of his very eyes. ELLIOTT: So clearly, two very different versions emerging about why Ahmaud Arbery was killed. KURTZLEBEN: Well, now, testimony started late on Friday, after 11 days of jury selection. And that's a process that resulted in a nearly all-white jury. What did the jury hear? ELLIOTT: The first witness for the state was Glynn County Police Officer William Duggan. He was one of the first to respond to the scene. Prosecutor Dunikoski played his body cam video that shows him approaching Travis McMichael as Arbery's body lay in the street. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) LINDA DUNIKOSKI: And what did that man covered in blood seated over there say to you when you asked him, are you OK? WILLIAM DUGGAN: He - it was a quick reply of basically, no, I'm not OK. I just effing killed somebody. ELLIOTT: So as you can hear there, a dramatic start - testimony is set to resume Monday morning. KURTZLEBEN: NPR's Debbie Elliott - thank you so much. ELLIOTT: You're welcome. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: And that's UP FIRST for Saturday, November 6, 2021. I'm Scott Simon.

      "text": "Identity: What does it mean to be Welsh?\n\nRugby, rolling hills, castles, coal and choirs - these are some of the images often associated with Wales and the Welsh.\n\nBut what are the experiences of Welsh people who have plural ethnic and cultural identities?\n\nWhat preconceptions might a black child face in rural Powys or a hijab-wearing Muslim face in Cardiff?\n\nWelshness should be seen as \"a spectrum rather than a hierarchy... a patchwork quilt\", said writer Hanan Issa.\n\nShe is one of a number of contributors to book Welsh Plural, a collection of essays \"on the future of Wales\" that offers \"imaginative, radical perspectives that take us beyond the clichés and binaries that so often shape thinking about Wales and Welshness\".\n\nWriter and filmmaker Kandace Siobhan Walker, 27, said when she and her family moved from east London to Brecon Beacons National Park, Powys, in 2003 they were \"poster children for multiculturalism, for globalisation\".\n\nFrom the age of nine until she left for university at 18, home was a remote house at the end of a bridleway.\n\nShe said it was difficult finding anyone who knew how to work with afro-textured hair so a hairdresser from over the border in Hereford would travel to see the family at home, her mother, who remains in the family home, found a man in Bristol who could order in Jamaican ingredients, and finding somewhere that stocked her favourite Caribbean drink sarsaparilla was a regular mission.\n\nIn her essay, Lights in the Dark: Notes towards a personal history of Wales in the 21st Century, Kandace writes about being \"tolerated nowhere, questioned everywhere\".\n\nAsked about what experiences led her to write those words, she recalled a time when she was 14 and a woman stopped her in a supermarket carpark.\n\n\"She asked me what tribe I was, I was like, 'what you're talking about?',\" she said.\n\nShe said hikers were often surprised to see a young black girl in the rural Welsh hills: \"Even if I was just in my own garden, walkers would be thinking I'm another walker - and I'm like, 'I'm in a dressing gown'.\n\n\"There's that implicit idea, 'why is she here?'\"\n\nShe also writes about the \"everyday dispossession\" of white strangers asking 'where are you from?' - \"a classic\".\n\n\"It's a very loaded question and I think people know that,\" she explained.\n\n\"'You come from somewhere else, maybe your family comes from somewhere else, or like your ancestors do' they know that history is fraught and so it feels often quite entitled... 'what trauma do you come from? Like, what's gone on there?'\"\n\nShe said by the time she got into her 20s she started simply saying, 'I'm from here'.\n\n\"I don't want to get into it with strangers usually.\"\n\nShe said when a black person asks the same question \"it's almost always a completely different conversation because they're going to tell me where they're from\".\n\n\"It's more like an excitement, we're going to compare, take out our little family histories and be like 'look how kind of similar bit different they are'.\"\n\nShe said white people who ask her where she is from have usually \"decided their history is kind of ubiquitous and uninteresting that they don't need to explain themselves to me\".\n\nKandace, who now lives in south London, said she wrote her contribution to the book at a time when she was thinking more about \"purposely identifying as Welsh\" and \"who decides that\".\n\n\"What happens if I start telling people I'm Welsh and just letting them argue it out for themselves,\" she said.\n\nShe said for a long time she was \"trying to let it not matter too much where I came from, or who I came from in terms of people - but eventually I just realised it was such an integral part of my life - my dad's family are African American and my mum's family are Jamaican Canadian...\n\n\"We moved to London but then moved to Wales so we've never fitted into a specific like pattern or group in terms of eras of migration.\"\n\nShe said through her writing she had realised \"how much it meant to me to have grown up in Wales and be Welsh\".\n\n\"I think Wales is just a fundamentally plural place, a place built on pluralities in its history and its culture and its language,\" she said.\n\n\"Despite kind of negative experiences I've had growing up, or even now, I always have hope and quite a lot of pride in Wales and Welsh culture.\"\n\nWriter Hanan Issa, 35, from Cardiff, said is was a discussion about the \"frustrations of how narrow the perception of Welshness is\" at the Hay Festival with three other Welsh writers that eventually led them to work on the book.\n\nShe said she had always had a \"plural perception of identity\".\n\n\"I'm mixed race, I've got Welsh heritage and Iraqi heritage,\" she said.\n\nShe said people had sometimes assumed she was not Welsh because of her appearance.\n\n\"Not so much recently, but you know I have had experiences where people will say things like 'oh your English is very good'.\n\n\"It doesn't work, this idea that you have to look Welsh.\"\n\nIn her essay - Have you heard the one about the niqabi on a bus? - she recalls times people have \"faced abuse because their outward appearance doesn't align with people's perception of Welshness\".\n\nShe writes about the time her white mother, who was wearing a niqab, was abused by a man in Cardiff indoor market.\n\n\"Looming over her, he shouted in a Cockney accent, 'Why don't you go back to your own country'.\n\n\"Without missing a beat my little nan squared up to this bully saying, 'she's my daughter and she's Welsh but you are not. Why don't you do us a favour and go back to your country?'\"\n\nShe concludes the anecdote: \"While it is a story of triumph, Nan's defence relied on my mum's white Welshness to emphasise her right to belong here.\"\n\nHanan said there was a \"very strange, luminous space between being seen as something foreign but having all these experiences that were very Welsh\".\n\nSo, what does it mean to be Welsh?\n\nHanan said an integral part of Islamic faith is \"khalifah\", meaning caretaker.\n\nShe wrote: \"Perhaps Wales and Welshness belongs to all those who care for her and the people who call her home.\"\n\nA review of the front page stories from the daily and weekly newspapers in Wales.\n\nKardo Mina, a final year student who also works part-time, says he regularly swaps meals for coffee.\n\nA14-year-old girl was convicted of attempted murder by a jury and is due to be sentenced.\n\nPolice have charged a 56-year-old man with the murder of Tracey Davies.\n\nThe event, organised by Yes Cymru and All Under One Banner Cymru, was held in Barry on Saturday.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Recalling the Testimony of Freed Slaves in Canada: 'Liberty I Find to Be Sweet Indeed'\n\nCanada celebrated Emancipation Day on Aug. 1, marking the day in 1834 that the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 came into effect across the British Empire, and putting the history of slavery in this country in the spotlight once again.\n\nFrom the late 18th century onward, Canada was viewed by many black American slaves as the light at the end of the Underground Railroad, which was a network of secret routes that led American slaves to their freedom in Canada.\n\nYet some have been pushing to emphasize Canada's guilt in slavery.\n\nAs with any nation, Canada has reason both to lament and to be proud of parts of its history, but Christopher Dummitt, a professor of Canadian history at Trent University, says that some are trying to distort Canada's history for \"political purpose.\"\n\nThe British and French colonies that made up what is now Canada did have slaves, though far fewer than many other places in the world at the time, he said.\n\n\"But the vastly more important point is to note the selective focus of contemporary activists when they single out only the slavery of Western nations,\" Mr. Dummitt told The Epoch Times via email.\n\n\"When in the United States, if a white man spoke to me, I would feel frightened, whether I were in the right or wrong; but now it is quite a different thing. If a white man speaks to me, I can look him right in the eyes. If he were to insult me, I could give him an answer. I have the rights and privileges of any other man,\" Mr. Grose said of his experience after arriving in Canada.\n\nHe spoke of being reunited with his wife and children, from whom he had been separated when his owner sold him. He spoke of being able to provide his children with an education, to vote, and to earn money, with many like him having \"become wealthy by industry, owning horses and carriages.\"\n\nThough many suffered in the south, the former slaves also recalled the help and kindness of many white Americans. \"I am not prejudiced against all the white race in the United States,\" Mr. Grose said.\n\nLieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe of Upper Canada advocated for abolition in 1793.\n\nThe story of a slave woman named Chloe Cooley helped gain support for abolition at the time. Her owner, Loyalist Adam Vrooman, was said to have violently beaten her and loaded her into a boat to be sold in New York.\n\nThe Upper Canada legislature passed a law limiting slavery in 1793. It did not free all existing slaves, but it did free the children of slaves once they reached the age of 25. Their owners were still to be responsible for making sure they were provided for and did not fall into poverty thereafter. It also prohibited the sale of slaves within the province and prohibited the import of slaves.\n\nWhat actually happened, he and others at the symposium said, was that Mr. Dundas had the word \"gradually\" added to legislation abolishing slavery. The legislation seemed about to fail for the third time in Parliament, and he hoped to gain more votes for it with this compromise.\n\nMr. Howe's report became part of the Congressional debate on the Fourteenth Amendment that established rights for free slaves in the United States.\n\nAmong the accounts of escaped slaves in the same region gathered by Mr. Drew are many who expressed appreciation for their new home.\n\n\"I reached Canada about a year ago. Liberty I find to be sweet indeed,\" said one such freed man, Henry Atkinson.\n\nAnother, James Adams, told Mr. Drew he was ready to buy the home he was renting.\n\n\"My family are with me. We live well, and enjoy ourselves,\" Mr. Adams said. \"I look upon slavery as the most disgusting system a man can live under.\"\n\nMr. Adams was raised in Virginia and fled slavery in August of 1824. \"I was young, and they had not treated me very badly; but I had seen older men treated worse than a horse or a hog ought to be treated; so, seeing what I was coming to, I wished to get away,\" he said.\n\nHe recounted his long and harrowing journey northward. It was with the help of several white friends and white strangers he met along the way that he made it to safety. On his boat to freedom, he met with a white man who knew him from his plantation in Virginia.\n\nThis man told Mr. Adams a reward of US$100 was on his head and he had been told to post ads for the reward on his northward journey. \"He showed us several handbills to that effect. He said they had been given him to put up along the road, but he had preferred to keep them in his pocket,\" Mr. Adams said.\n\nHardships also awaited many who arrived in Canada with nothing. Famously, black loyalists arriving in Nova Scotia during the American Revolutionary War had been promised land and provisions but were given much less than white loyalists, or even none at all.\n\nBut the descendant of one such loyalist has expressed gratitude at the opportunity his fifth-great grandfather, William Barton, was given when he settled in Digby, Nova Scotia.\n\n\"His children's names are now in the family tree that I have. His four daughters married happily to have their own children without the fear of their children becoming enslaved. His family really established in Digby and that name fortunately lives on today.\""

Simply living in a neighbourhood where other people are mixing with minorities is enough to reduce racial prejudice.'\n\nHe added: 'Governments should do more to encourage different groups to mix with each other, as we now know that this reduces prejudice not just in individuals but throughout entire neighbourhoods.\n\n'Social interventions that aim to increase contact between groups will help to establish more tolerant social norms in society.

Perceptions of faces are distorted when we feel poorer, claims study\n\nBy DAILY MAIL REPORTER\n\nPublished: 15:02 EDT, 9 June 2014 | Updated: 15:02 EDT, 9 June 2014\n\n353\n\nView comments\n\nSome of the world's most troubling times, which have included periods of intense racism, have occurred during economic downturns.\n\nAnd now a new study has found that people really do have a tendency to become more racist during a recession.\n\nResearchers found that faces seem 'blacker' and have stronger racial features during an economic downturn, and this in turn increases the likelihood of discrimination.\n\nA new study has found that people have a tendency to become more racist during a recession. In an experiment, participants judged faces have having a darker skin tone and stronger 'Afrocentric' features during a financial downturn (bottom left graph). When they were asked to distribute money, people allotted less money to a face with stronger 'Afrocentric' features in times of financial scarcity than to the same face in normal economic conditions (right)\n\nThe study by New York University claims that conditions of 'resource scarcity' alter people's perception of race.\n\nTheir work follows a study last year, which suggested racism is on the rise in the UK, fuelled by financial strife.\n\nIn four experiments, involving 285 non-black Americans, scientists David Amodio and Amy Krosch found people see faces different during an economic downturn.\n\n'It's well known socioeconomic disparities between white Americans and racial minorities expand dramatically under conditions of economic scarcity,' Professor Amodio said.\n\n'Our findings indicate scarcity changes the way people visually perceive another person's race - and this perceptual distortion can contribute to disparities.'\n\nIn the first experiment, participants were shown pictures of faces which varied along a continuum from black to white, before being asked to state whether the face in the image was black or white.\n\nIndividuals who held strong beliefs that white people suffer financially when black people make economic gains were more likely to perceive mixed-race faces as black, than individuals without such beliefs.\n\nThe study by New York University claims that conditions of 'resource scarcity' alter people's perception of race. Here, graffiti is shown on the side of a derelict warehouse in Detroit, which has been largely distressed since the collapse of the motor industry\n\nIn the second experiment, the concept of economic scarcity was unconsciously introduced with subliminal messages like 'scarce', 'sparse' and 'limited'. The scientists found that more people were likely to perceive mixed-race face images as black than when economic scarcity was not introduced.\n\nKrosch said: 'People typically assume what they see is an accurate representation of the world so if their initial perceptions of race are actually distorted by economic factors people may not even realise the potential for bias.'\n\nThose who more strongly believed in resource competition between both racial types had a lower threshold for identifying mixed-race faces as black, than did subjects who did not hold these views.\n\nPeople under financial strain generated images of faces with darker skin and stronger 'Afrocentric' features than people without tight budgets, in the third experiment.\n\nAnd in the final test, participants allocated less money to faces that were perceived as 'more black' when money was scarce.\n\nAccording to the study, which is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 'the results suggest that economic scarcity may alter individuals' visual perception of black Americans, likely eliciting increased discrimination and that this process may worsen socioeconomic disparities.'\n\nProfessor Amodio said: 'Together our results provide strong converging evidence for the role of perceptual biases as a mechanism through which economic scarcity enhances discrimination and contributes to racial disparities.'\n\nA recent international study found that white people develop 'passive tolerance' of minorities in mixed areas, such as central London (pictured) even if they have no direct contact with them\n\nPeople can be made less racist by simply moving to live in ethnically-mixed areas, a recent study claims.\n\nInternational research found that white people develop 'passive tolerance' of minorities in mixed areas, even if they have no direct contact with them.\n\nProfessor Miles Hewstone, director of the Oxford Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict, said governments could create more 'harmonious neighbourhoods' by doing more to encourage different ethnic groups to mix.\n\n'If two white people with identical views went to live in different postcodes for a year, the person in the neighbourhood with more mixing between ethnic groups would likely leave more tolerant,' he said.\n\n'We would see this effect even if they never personally spoke to people from other ethnicities.\n\nThe Oxford University-led study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal, is based on seven studies carried out in England, mainland Europe, the United States and South Africa between 2002 and 2011.\n\nIt found that even highly prejudiced people who did not mix with those of different ethnicities became more tolerant the longer they lived in mixed areas.\n\nThe scientists suggest simply seeing white strangers 'interacting positively' with ethnic minorities is enough to reduce racial prejudice.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nBombshell new report reveals who made fatal mistake that caused Black Hawk to collide with jet and kill 67\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "'Maybe it is a white saviour thing - but we need the help': Family of the five-year-old boy Strictly TV star Stacey Dooley posed with in Uganda speak out amid Comic Relief row\n\nBy CLAIRE DUFFIN IN LUUKA, UGANDA FOR THE DAILY MAIL\n\nPublished: 17:06 EDT, 8 March 2019 | Updated: 20:03 EDT, 8 March 2019\n\n199\n\nView comments\n\nThe image is one that will be familiar to millions by now. Stacey Dooley , with professional blow-dry, beautiful teeth and half a million-plus Instagram followers after a successful turn on Strictly Come Dancing , hoisting a five-year-old Ugandan boy onto her hip for Comic Relief .\n\nShe beamed and gushed ('Ob.sessssssssed' followed by a broken heart emoji). The little boy sucked his finger while, from somewhere, came the sound of a diplomatic and ethical maelstrom - before chaos ensued.\n\nWhile the picture, taken on Saturday, February 23, was gathering 'likes' (almost 52,000 at the last count) an indignant debate was raging over so-called 'white saviour syndrome'.\n\nMwesigwa Waiswa, 5, (centre in yellow t-shirt) is looked after by his grandmother Beatrice Kituumira Bugonzi (above), 50, who holds cousin Faheem, 2, at their home in Luuka county. Ms Bugonzi said she\n\nThe term refers to white people who travel to poorer, black nations in the belief they are helping without truly understanding the history and causes of the poverty. Crassly barging in with generous offers of help when people are entirely capable, and willing, to help themselves, painting themselves as the educators, the developers, the colonial supremacists still 'in charge'.\n\nLabour MP David Lammy waded into the fracas saying Stacey's 'colonial image' did a disservice to poor Africans. Uganda's High Commissioner Julius Peter Moto took to the This Morning sofa, while Stacey's choice of caption on her Instagram photo was likened to how social media users described a new handbag or pair of shoes, not a little boy. In short, she was accused of 'poverty porn'.\n\nStacey, a BBC presenter and successful documentary maker of ten years standing - and no wallflower - quickly sniped back. She said it was 'ridiculous' to suggest she would 'stroll up' to a child she did not know and force him to have a 'selfie', pointing out she had been working in Africa for nearly 12 years and knew how to behave.\n\nStacey Dooley posted this photo of her holding 5-year-old Mwesigwa Waiswa on February 23 during the Uganda  trip. Mr Lammy criticised the 'white saviour' complex promoted by celebrities such as Miss Dooley\n\nComic Relief said the photo was a personal shot 'taken at the request of the child's family, and not part of any appeal film'.\n\nOthers quickly leapt to defend the work of Comic Relief, which has raised more than £1billion for good causes and funds a number of projects in Uganda, filling a small part of a void left by a lack of state investment and high-level corruption.\n\nThere was a short volley of argument and counter argument before the news agenda moved on.\n\nBut what hasn't been told - until now - is the story of the little boy himself.\n\nWe can reveal that his name is Mwesigwa Waiswa, and he was born in a rural village in Eastern Uganda. Mercifully, he probably still doesn't know how poor he is.\n\n'She asked: \"Can I hold him?\" I said OK. She wanted to take a photo. Another person then asked if that was OK, so they brought out papers,' said grandmother We had no idea who she was. For us, we just saw people.\n\nThis week, the Mail tracked down Mwesigwa and his family in his village. We found him sitting on the ground outside his home, dressed in a yellow T-shirt on back to front and inside out - every five-year-old's preferred style.\n\nThose deep brown eyes that melted Stacey's heart had the same sullen intensity as he surveyed this new set of white strangers trailing to his home.\n\nNot surprisingly, he was completely oblivious to the row his brief cuddle with Dooley caused.\n\nAbandoned by his mother when he was just two years old, Mwesigwa is now raised by his paternal grandmother, Beatrice Kituumira Bugonzi. She is also looking after three other grandchildren including Mwesigwa's older brother, another child abandoned by their mother and one orphaned after both parents died.\n\nDooley, 31, recently film a documentary with Comic Relief about neonatal clinics and malaria in Uganda. She presents a series called Stacey Dooley Investigates on BBC 3 which looks at  current affairs issues affecting young people around the world.\n\nThey share a single room in a brick shelter with rag mattresses on the floor, while cooking is done on a log fire outside.\n\nMrs Bugonzi is a subsistence farmer, growing foods such as sweet potatoes, bananas and cassava, which can be used to make flour, to feed herself and her grandchildren.\n\nA widow after her husband died seven years ago, she is 50 but looks much older. She also does manual work for other people in her village to raise a few Ugandan shillings to pay for essentials such as paraffin and soap. 'I'm finding it hard looking after these children. They were literally dumped here with me,' said Mrs Bugonzi through an interpreter.\n\n'Their parents didn't say anything after dropping them here. Sometimes they visit but they don't bring anything and then they leave again. They don't help at all.'\n\nMention Stacey Dooley and Comic Relief and she simply shrugs: 'I have no idea of what Comic Relief help does - there is no direct help for me,' she says.\n\n'Whether they pay for the facilities in the hospital, I have no idea. All I know is I am struggling to look after my children.\n\n'I don't have a problem with foreigners coming and filming here if it results in help, but often they come and take pictures which are used to collect money.\n\n'Whatever happens with that money raised from pictures of my children, I do not see it. It does not benefit me directly.'\n\nThe Labour MP for Tottenham (pictured from behind) said today that her comments showed she had 'failed to educate herself', adding on BBC News' Victoria Derbyshire show: 'Her Instagram conveys the age old trope that is her as the heroine and the black child as the victim and we have to stop it'\n\nTalk to Mwesigwa's grandfather's brother, 50-year-old Afani Isabirye, however, and another story emerges entirely. This is a complex situation, with no clear rights and wrongs.\n\nMr Isabirye is part of what is known locally as a Village Health Team - people trained to test children for malaria, administer medication if it is detected and give health advice, particularly to pregnant women.\n\nMuch of the training for the crucial volunteers is paid for by Comic Relief and Stacey - at the height of her popularity following her Strictly win - came to the region to hear the tragic story of a woman who had lost two babies because she was unable to get to the nearest hospital.\n\nNo doubt it was a harrowing story and an important issue, which will be relayed to viewers this Friday on Red Nose Day.\n\nMr Lammy did acknowledge Miss Dooley's 'good motives' but bemoaned the British celebrity trope of travelling to poorer parts of Africa to film Comic Relief packages\n\nMr Isabirye said the BBC team spent two-and-a-half days in their village, after arriving in a couple of 4x4s and a people carrier.\n\nHe said the arrival of a team of six 'white people' as well as a number of local guides caused a bit of a stir and many villagers came out to see what was happening. Most of the filming, he said, was done with the woman who had lost her children, both inside and outside her home.\n\nOn the last day Mr Isabirye watched as his little great-nephew Mwesigwa wandered over to him, a bit grizzly and in need of attention, and he picked him up.\n\nDocumentary maker Stacey Dooley has been criticised for not meeting up with a No White Saviours group while on a charity trip to Uganda\n\nThat was when Stacey spotted him and went over. 'We had no idea who she was. For us, we just saw people. She introduced herself as Stacey Dooley but she did not go into detail about who she was,' says Mr Isabirye. 'She asked: \"Can I hold him?\" I said OK. She wanted to take a photo. Another person then asked if that was OK, so they brought out papers (so they could sign their consent).\n\n'She did ask briefly about the boy, and we told them he had no parents. Once they took the photo that was the end and they went on to other filming.'\n\nNot quite the same explanation given by Comic Relief, then, who insisted the encounter was instigated by Mwesigwa's family.\n\nWhatever the truth, Mr Isabirye was quick to praise Comic Relief and the work they did, dismissing concerns over 'white saviourism' as a luxury he could not afford.\n\nHe earns just 12,000 shillings a week - £2.50 - writing reports in his role with the Village Health Team in his village of 2,000 people. Like many East African countries, the divide between rich and poor in Uganda is stark.\n\nWhile some in the capital Kampala enjoy a good quality of life, those in the rural north and east are hardest hit, with 84 per cent living in poverty, according to the World Bank's poverty assessment report, with limited or no access to electricity.\n\nHealthcare is provided by the government, but state-funded facilities are woefully lacking in vital medicines and equipment and are often miles from villages, with people unable to pay to travel when they fall ill.\n\nFaced with impossible financial straits, Mr Isabirye - who is also a subsistence farmer - sees Comic Relief as a life-saver.\n\nIt helped train 200 village health teams and he had nothing but gratitude for Stacey.\n\nIn his broken English he explained: 'It is important. I don't know why they are criticising her. When these people come there is a possibility that people in the UK will watch - and when they watch, they will be able to help us. Maybe build a hospital.\n\n'If they don't come people probably won't donate. There is no doubt that we need the help, so how that help comes is not the problem. How it comes is not important.\n\n'Maybe it is a \"white saviour\" thing, but whatever it is we need the help, and if showing what is happening here means we get help, then so be it.'\n\nYet the image of the white woman, in her £265 boots, with a needy black child in her arms, rankles with local activists.\n\nThey speak of underlying discrimination and the relationship between white and black people that dates back to the first Europeans who raided Africa for slaves and raw materials.\n\nMP David Lammy responds to critics who say that he should go to Uganda with Comic Relief rather than just criticise film-maker Dooley. He defended his decision to turn down an invitation to avoid becoming a 'cheerleader' instead of a representative\n\nBut as well as celebrities 'roughing' it for charity, Uganda is a mecca for evangelistic aid workers, and students on gap years - dubbed 'voluntourists' by critics. While the vast majority are undoubtedly well meaning, there are those who are not.\n\nLater this month, an American woman is due in court in Uganda accused of running a clinic and treating children without being qualified.\n\nShe is being sued by the mothers of two children who are alleged to have died in her care.\n\nMeanwhile, police are reportedly hunting a 70-year-old German, who is accused of sexually abusing children in his care at a rehabilitation centre on an island on Lake Victoria.\n\nNo White Saviours - a Ugandan campaign group set up in 2013, which first took Stacey to task over her posts - said discussion was required over the complex history of former colonies.\n\nThe group was set up by Kelsey Nielsen and Olivia Alaso after they met in Uganda when they were both taking their sick children to a health centre.\n\nKelsey, who is white and whose parents are evangelical Christians, has admitted she was 'part of the problem' when she left home aged 23 to set up a family centre in Uganda. She now says she had no business setting it up in the first place. Africa should not be a 'playground' for white people, she said.\n\nOlivia said Mwesigwa's family would have been unaware of how widely shared the photo would have been when they signed the consent - and pointed out that people would not approach children they did not know to take pictures in other countries.\n\nShe said: 'What is he gaining from this? What did he gain from her likes on Instagram? What has she done for them? Nothing.' Grace Deebula, assistant project co-ordinator at The AIDS Support Organisation (Taso) who was also pictured with Stacey during her trip, perhaps summed it up best when she said that while people needed help they were not helpless.\n\nGrace works to raise awareness of malaria and the importance of diagnosing it early, after her own son Paul almost died when he was just a few months old. Comic Relief has funded testing kits and nets.\n\nSpeaking during a training programme for health workers in the Amuria district, she said the BBC crew witnessed a little boy die of the disease.\n\n'Uganda can prevent malaria but they can't do away with it. The standard of living is really too poor. Families have lots of children and the resources are not enough.\n\n'The money donated in the UK really helps and the visit by Comic Relief was really important - according to the information they gave us - in capturing the impact of malaria to show to the British people. I know when it is shown, they'll really see the usefulness of the money they are donating.'\n\nAsked about white celebrities fronting the films, she said: 'Stacey is really a good person.\n\n'She interacted with the people, but maybe another time we could have someone from Uganda sharing the importance of Comic Relief and malaria.'\n\nMeanwhile, back in the village, Mwesigwa and his great uncle are still to grasp the fuss that this image has caused. Without access to the internet, they probably never will.\n\nBut with malaria, disease and malnutrition an ever-present reality in this five-year-old's life, Mr Isabirye says share away.\n\n'If it means more help, if people see my boy and how he comes from a poor place, then that is good.'\n\nA Comic Relief spokesperson said last night: 'Stacey was asked to make a film to explore the work we're doing in Uganda and we're grateful to her for this. She is a professional documentary maker and has a unique ability to connect with people.\n\n'Both Comic Relief and Stacey remain in ongoing communication with the project who are in contact with the family locally.\n\n'We regret the impact this is having on them, the project workers and community.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have been moderated in advance.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA trial is set to begin Tuesday for two white men in Mississippi who are accused of chasing and shooting at a Black FedEx driver who had dropped off a package at a home.\n\nBrandon Case and his father, Gregory Charles Case, were indicted in November on charges of attempted first-degree murder, conspiracy and shooting into the vehicle of D'Monterrio Gibson in January 2022.\n\nGibson, who was 24 at the time, was not injured. But the chase and gunfire led to complaints on social media of racism in Brookhaven, about 55 miles (90 kilometers) south of the state capital, Jackson. The trial will take place in Brookhaven.\n\nDuring a news conference days after the confrontation, Gibson said he was wearing a FedEx uniform and driving an unmarked van FedEx had rented when he dropped off a package at a house. He said that as he was leaving, he noticed a white pickup truck pulling away from another house on the same large lot.\n\nGibson said the pickup driver tried to cut him off as he left the driveway. He said he swerved around the driver and then encountered a second man who had a gun pointed at the van and was motioning for him to stop. Gibson said the man fired as he drove away, damaging the van and packages inside. The white pickup chased him to Interstate 55 near Brookhaven before ending the pursuit, he said.\n\nDEM GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE TOOK MONEY FROM CCP-LINKED BUSINESSMAN, HUNTER BIDEN ART BUYER\n\nFedEx driver D'Monterrio Gibson speaks at a news conference in Mississippi, on Feb. 10, 2022, about his experience where he alleges he was fired upon and chased by a white father and son while delivering packages on his route in Brookhaven, Mississippi.\n\nCarlos Moore, an attorney who represented Gibson in a lawsuit in federal court, compared the episode to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery , a 25-year-old Black man who was running empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision in 2020 when three white strangers chased him down and blasted him with a shotgun.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III dismissed the $5 million lawsuit Moore filed on behalf of Gibson in January 2023. The suit was against FedEx, the city of Brookhaven, Brookhaven Police Chief Kenny Collins, Brandon Case and Gregory Charles Case.\n\nJordan wrote that Gibson's attorney failed to prove FedEx discriminated against Gibson because of his race .\n\n\"The Cases' alleged conduct is deplorable,\" Jordan wrote. \"But Gibson fails to state a viable claim against FedEx for which the Court would have original jurisdiction.\"\n\nMoore said Friday that he plans to sue in state court.

It's tragic no matter how you look at it, who did it or why,\" Jada Hathcock told Fox News Digital.\n\nOn April 18, Carlton Gilford, a homeless man, allegedly shot Jada's brother Lundin Hathcock, 35, in the head while he was seated at a computer in a Tulsa library. He then went to a nearby QuikTrip convenience store and shot 55-year-old James McDaniel.

Not racism! Two innocent people were taken, and it's a tragedy,\" she said.\n\nThe country has been rocked by a spate of mass shootings in recent weeks, such as the mall massacre in Texas and the hospital shooting in Georgia, and the terrifying murders in Tulsa were yet another grim reminder that gun violence feels to more Americans like it can strike anywhere.\n\n\"It's sad, it's awful,\" Hathcock said of the country's perceived culture of violence, pausing to collect her thoughts. \"I have two daughters. And honestly, now I'm terrified for my child to even go to a library, to even go in a gas station. I don't understand it, and unfortunately, we're not ever going to be able to rid this world of the evil that lives here. There's always going to be a bad person making these choices, and it is very, very sad.

Trying to process a life that he's no longer in is one of the hardest thing any of us have had to go through. And I know that the way it's happened has definitely haunted most of us.

The Tulsa County District Attorney's Office declined to comment on the latest developments in the case and whether it would seek the death penalty.\n\n\"As with all cases, we will present the facts in court and make our evaluations and decisions accordingly. It is too early in the case to make decisions regarding how the evidence will be presented or what punishments will be pursued,\" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We're trusting the justice system, and we expected it would be handled as it would be handled in any situation, and we're just hoping that a bad person is put away for his crimes and makes the world a little bit safer,\" Hathcock said.\n\nCarlton Gilford is charged with murdering two men in Oklahoma in what may be a racially motivated hate crime.

I'm sure the lives he saved would say the same. Our entire family is heartbroken and adjusting to life without him is one of the hardest things we have all had to go through. Our hearts break for the other victim involved as well.\"\n\nHathcock called her brother a typical boy growing up, saying he was a happy child who was protective of his two sisters - one older, one younger. He also loved the library and enjoyed reading there.\n\n\"He was loving and kind, and he would do anything for anybody,\" she said.\n\nMcDaniel, the other victim in the case, was mourned by his family, who said he would be \"missed dearly.\" A close friend said James was a funny guy who loved his friends, according to local station News9.\n\nGilford, 61, is being held without bond and will make his next court appearance in June.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nA father and son have been indicted by a grand jury after allegedly chasing and shooting at a FedEx driver in January after he dropped off a package in a Mississippi city .\n\nBrandon and Gregory Case, who are both white, were re-arrested Friday and indicted for attempted first-degree murder, conspiracy and shooting into the vehicle of D'Monterrio Gibson, who is Black. The charges were upgraded from conspiracy and aggravated assault.\n\nGibson, 24, was not injured. But the chase and gunfire have sparked social media complaints of racism in Brookhaven, about 55 miles south of the state capital, Jackson.\n\nGibson and his attorney, Carlos Moore, said they pushed prosecutors to secure an indictment for nearly 10 months.\n\nALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI MOURNERS REMEMBER OFFICER WHO WAS KILLED ON DUTY\n\n\"It was an extremely long process to get this far into the case,\" Gibson told WLBT-TV. \"I feel like most of the time, I was treated like a suspect rather than a victim.\"\n\nMoore compared the incident to the killing of Ahmaud Arbery , a 25-year-old Black man who was running empty-handed through a Georgia subdivision in 2020 when three white strangers chased him down and blasted him with a shotgun.\n\nMoore has called for a federal hate crime probe into the case. A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press in February that the department received a request to look into the case and was reviewing the request to determine any next steps. The department did not provide an update Tuesday.\n\nThis combination of booking photos provided by Lincoln County Sheriff's Department show Brandon Case, left, and his father Gregory Charles Case on Feb. 1, 2022. (Lincoln County Sheriff's Department via AP)\n\nGibson said he was wearing a FedEx uniform and was driving an unmarked van that FedEx had rented when he dropped off a package at a house in Brookhaven on Jan. 24. As he was leaving, he said he noticed a white pickup truck pulling away from another house on the same large lot.\n\nThe pickup driver then tried to cut him off as he pulled out of the driveway, he said. Gibson swerved around him and then encountered a second man who had a gun pointed at the van and was motioning for him to stop. Gibson said the man fired as he drove away, damaging the van and packages inside. He said the white pickup chased him to the interstate highway near Brookhaven before ending the pursuit.\n\nAttorneys for Brandon and Gregory Case did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Cases were initially arrested in February and released after paying bonds on lesser charges. Lincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing said bond was set at $500,000 for the upgraded charges, according to the Brookhaven Daily Leader.\n\nMoore doesn't expect the case to go to trial until May of 2023 at the earliest.\n\nThe hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nWanda Cooper-Jones says President Trump was compassionate and listened to families' concerns.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys on Friday presented dueling portraits of Ahmaud Arbery, who was either an innocent Black runner fatally shot by three White strangers or \"a scary mystery\" who had been seen prowling around a Georgia neighborhood.\n\nIn her opening statement, prosecutor Linda Dunikoski said the short cellphone video that stirred national outrage over Arbery's slaying offered only a glimpse of the attack on the 25-year-old, who gave his pursuers no reason to suspect him of any wrongdoing.\n\n\"They assumed that he must have committed some crime that day,\" Dunikoski said. \"He tried to run around their truck and get way from these strangers, total strangers, who had already told him that they would kill him. And then they killed him.\"\n\nMarcus Arbery, center, father of Ahmaud Arbery, takes his seat during a pretrial motion hearing in the trial of Greg and Travis McMichael and their neighbor, William \"Roddie\" Bryan, at the Glynn County Courthouse, Thursday, Nov. 4, 2021, in Brunswick, Ga.

Morton, Pool)\n\nA defense attorney for Travis McMichael, the man who shot Arbery three times, put the shooting in a much different light. Attorney Robert Rubin described Arbery to the jury as \"an intruder\" who had four times been recorded on video \"plundering around\" a neighboring house under construction.\n\nMcMichael and his father, Greg McMichael, gave chase, hoping to detain Arbery until police arrived, Rubin said, but Arbery refused to stop and lunged toward McMichael and his gun.\n\n\"It is a horrible, horrible video, and it's tragic that Ahmaud Arbery lost his life,\" Rubin said. \"But at that point, Travis McMichael is acting in self-defense. He did not want to encounter Ahmaud Arbery physically. He was only trying to stop him for the police.\"\n\nAHMAUD ARBERY SHOOTING: MURDER TRIAL HITS SNAG DURING JURY SELECTION AMID VIRAL VIDEO\n\nArbery's killing on Feb . 23, 2020, was largely ignored until the video leaked and deepened a national reckoning over racial injustice.\n\nOn that Sunday afternoon, the McMichaels armed themselves and pursued Arbery in a pickup truck as he ran through their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick. A neighbor, William \"Roddie\" Bryan, joined the chase and recorded graphic video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery with a shotgun.\n\nThea Brooks stands in front of a mural of her slain nephew, Ahmaud Arbery, in Brunswick Ga. on Oct. 5, 2021. (AP Photo/Russ Bynum)\n\nThe chase started when a neighbor who's not charged in the case called a nonemergency police number after seeing Arbery wandering inside a home under construction, where security cameras had recorded him before.\n\nDunikoski said Greg McMichael later told police that at one point during the chase he shouted at Arbery, \"Stop or I'll blow your f--ing head off!\"\n\nWhen a police officer who responded to the shooting asked Greg McMichael if Arbery had broken into a house, he told the officer: \"That's just it. I don't know ... I don't know. He might have gone in somebody's house,\" according to Dunikoski.\n\n\"All three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions - not on facts, not on evidence,\" Dunikoski said. \"And they made decisions in their driveways based on those assumptions that took a young man's life.\"\n\nAHMAUD ARBERY DEATH: 12-PERSON JURY CONSISTS OF 11 WHITE JUROS, DESPITE PROTESTS FROM PROSECUTION\n\nAs Dunikoski played the video of Arbery's death for the jury, his mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, cried out in the courtroom and sobbed as her attorney tried to console her.\n\nRubin described Arbery as a \"scary mystery\" to residents of a neighborhood already on edge from thefts and property crimes. Travis McMichael saw him outside the home construction site at night 11 days before the shooting. When Arbery reached for his pocket, Rubin said, Travis Michael feared he was reaching for gun.\n\nThat's why the McMichaels grabbed guns before chasing Arbery, Rubin said, insisting they had probable cause to suspect Arbery had been stealing - and therefore at the time could have legally detained him under a Georgia law allowing citizen's arrests - which was repealed by state lawmakers in response to Arbery's death.\n\nAs Arbery ran toward the McMichaels' truck, as seen on the video, Travis McMichael raised the shotgun in hopes that \"he's going to deescalate the situation,\" Rubin said. Instead of running past, Rubin said, Arbery turned toward Travis McMichael \"swinging aggressively\" with his fists.\n\nTravis McMichael, Rubin said, recalled his firearms training from when he served in the Coast Guard: \"Never lose your weapon. And that's why he shoots.\"\n\n\"He has no choice because if this guy gets his gun, he's dead or his dad's dead,\" Rubin said.\n\nFILE - In this 2012 file photo provided by Yolanda Richardson, of FuzzyRabbit Fotos, Ahmaud Arbery poses for a senior photo on St. Andrews Beach, Jekyll Island, Ga. A judge is expected to delve into the jury selection process at a hearing Thursday, July 22, 2021, for the upcoming murder trial of three men accused of killing Arbery, who was chased and shot after he was spotted running in a Georgia neighborhood. (Yolanda Richardson/FuzzyRabbit Fotos via AP, File) (AP)\n\nGreg McMichael was in his driveway reupholstering boat cushions when he saw Arbery run past \"hauling ass\" on the day of the shooting, said Franklin Hogue, Greg McMichael's defense attorney.\n\n\"Greg McMichael was absolutely sure this was the guy, the same guy he had seen on surveillance video inside a house where Greg had sound reasons to believe theft had occurred, burglary,\" Hogue said.\n\nHogue said most facts in the trial are not in dispute.\n\n\"The why it happened is what this case is about,\" Hogue said. \"This case is about intent, beliefs, knowledge - reasons for beliefs whether they were true or not.\"\n\nBryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, deferred making an opening statement until after prosecutors rest their case .\n\nAll three defendants are standing trial together, charged with murder and other felonies.\n\nArbery had been dead for more than two months when Bryan's video of the killing leaked online in May 2020. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police. GBI agents arrested the McMichaels the next day, and charged Bryan two weeks later.\n\nDunikoski described Arbery as an \"avid runner\" and told the jury it was not surprising for him to go running in the Satilla Shores subdivision, which was less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from his own home.\n\nWhen he was killed, Arbery had no weapon and was carrying no wallet or keys, Dunikoski said.\n\nArbery \"couldn't even have called for help if he wanted to because he had no cellphone on him,\" she added.\n\nControversy erupted Wednesday, the final day of jury selection, when prosecutors objected to a final jury consisting of 11 Whites and one Black juror. They argued that defense attorneys had cut eight potential jurors from the final panel because they are Black, which the U.S. Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley agreed that there appeared to be \"intentional discrimination,\" but said Georgia law limited his authority to intervene because defense attorneys stated non-racial reasons for excluding Black panelists from the jury.\n\nThe hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

By the way, he paid these guys with a check. The guy's an idiot in addition to everything else,\" Limbaugh said on his radio program. \"The left is nothing but phony hate crimes, phony alleged hate crimes, phony charges, made-up stories.\"\n\nSmollett was charged in Chicago police for planning a fake attack , accusing two white strangers of calling him racist and homophobic names, putting a noose around his neck, pouring bleach on him and using a pro-Trump slogan.\n\nSMOLLETT'S CELEBRITY SUPPORTERS GRAPPLE WITH ARREST NEWS\n\n\"They know these things probably aren't true, but they want them to be, and that's why they report them as true,\" Limbaugh said. \"So in the mind of the American left, these crimes are happening everywhere. Even if the Smollett case isn't real, it's real elsewhere, and we must 'raise consciousness.'\"\n\nLimbaugh also called out the media for their Smollett coverage and took presidential candidates Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. , and Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ., to task for their initial reaction saying Sen. Harris \"couldn't wait to believe this.\"\n\n\"So he stages a couple of hoaxes here trying to get paid and trying to get noticed, and he plays the media like a Stradivarius. He plays the American left like a Stradivarius,\" Limbaugh said. \"The media is signing on to it. The celebrities are signing on to it. Presidential candidates are signing on to it and tweeting what a rotten place America is because of it.\"\n\n'THE VIEW' HOSTS DON'T UNDERSTAND SMOLLETT'S PAY-RAISE MOTIVE\n\n\"It's just outrageous what the left is doing to this country and the picture of this country that they're painting each and every day, the false narratives that they are establishing, many of which they know to be untrue,\" Limbaugh said.\n\nThe only person that generated any praise from Limbaugh was Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson who blasted Smollet in a press conference this morning.\n\n\"This guy called out presidential candidates for piling on here without any evidence whatsoever. He called out a bunch of people being punked and fooled by an actor. He called out the actor himself as an African-American. How dare this man sully the civil rights legacy of this country by taking advantage of it for his own desire to get more money,\" Limbaugh said. \"This is an adult.

White America didn't particularly like that, and liked Jack Johnson even less.\n\nHe had beaten Jim Jeffries in the Fight of the Century, throwing a downer on the Fourth of July celebration in 1910. Many who dared to cheer for him were beaten around the country, so when Johnson returned victorious to Chicago, his friends posted handbills laying out the rules for his homecoming party:\n\nDon't talk to white strangers.\n\nDon't drink any gin.\n\nDon't tote a gun.\n\nBut be there.\n\nJack Johnson was there, but he didn't always play by the rules. He liked white women and he flaunted it, a crime worse to many Americans at the time than a black man winning the heavyweight title.\n\nIt cost him nearly a year in prison, and stole from him what could have been the best years of his boxing career. Through it all, Johnson was unrepentant, knowing he was the victim of a frame-up due solely to the color of his skin.\n\nHe died a convicted felon, likely never dreaming there might be a day the wrongs would be made right.\n\nPresident Barack Obama could take care of it all with a stroke of his pen. The fact that he hasn't already is as puzzling as it is troubling.\n\nObama had the perfect chance to give Johnson a posthumous pardon last July 4, 100 years to the date after his win over Jeffries. A resolution calling for the president to do just that had already passed both houses of Congress, and the campaign for the pardon had some serious celebrity and political star power behind it.\n\nBut the president passed on the opportunity, and there's no indication he's given it much serious thought since.\n\nSure, there are more pressing matters facing the leader of the free world. But this is such a no-brainer that the only opposition so far comes from some stuffed shirts in the Justice Department who say pardons should be reserved for those still living.\n\nAmong the pardon backers is filmmaker Ken Burns, whose 2005 documentary, \"Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson,\" detailed the case against Johnson and the sentencing judge's determination to \"send a message\" to black men about relationships with white women. Burns helped form the Committee to Pardon Jack Johnson, which, since 2004, has been lobbying for a pardon.\n\nMore recently, Arizona Sen. John McCain and New York Rep. Peter King said they plan to reintroduce a congressional resolution urging a pardon. Another legislator, Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, said he plans to mention it to Obama's new chief of staff, William Daley, and Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nThere's no need for a lot of talking, if only because it's hard to dispute the facts of Johnson's conviction for violating the Mann Act by transporting a woman across state lines for immoral purposes. The first famous black athlete in America was railroaded by a white establishment appalled by his refusal to behave the way they believed a black man should.\n\nJohnson fled the country rather than go to prison, fighting abroad in Europe and even Cuba before finally returning seven years later to serve 10 months in Leavenworth. By then his career was basically over, though he would fight on into the 1930s.\n\nJohnson scared a lot of people, and not just those who got into the ring with him. Brash and flamboyant, he was an educated man who was conversant in several languages, often read novels in French and played music on his Renaissance-era viol. He was a threat because he commanded so much attention, and it was telling that a quarter century passed before another black man - Joe Louis - finally became heavyweight champion again.\n\nWhy Obama didn't act last year is unclear, particularly since there seems to be little political risk associated with a posthumous pardon. Johnson was a victim of his times, and clearing his name in the history books isn't a notion that is terribly controversial.\n\nIt's nearly 100 years late.\n\nAnd it can't come soon enough.\n\n____\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nFormer NFL player shares his thoughts with 'Fox & Friends'\n\nAs we enter a second season of protest of our country's flag by young, wealthy black NFL athletes, millions of fans will continue to turn off America's favorite past time. The NFL, whose brand was once our country's most uniting one, is rapidly re-branding itself as a divisive one. In a sport where a player's lack of decorum deemed detrimental to the game - such as celebrating in the end zone - is met with harsh penalties, the NFL's corporate leadership has taken a knee as they allow their platform to be used for political anti-America sentiment.\n\nIt is possible that by visiting our past, Americans might gain insight as to why successful black American athletes feel compelled to kneel as we honor our flag and white corporate leaders refuse to take a stand to defend it.\n\nIn a world where slavery, totalitarianism and kingdoms were the accepted norm, the young American experiment was indeed a paradox. Though it was America that introduced to the world game-changing concepts like \"We The People\" and \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\" it would take another 87 years and over 600,000 American lives to atone for slavery and to begin to align itself with our Founders' vision.\n\nIn the meantime, there was another reality for millions of African slaves whose experience mirrored that of a young African boy brought to America in 1848. He arrived in the belly of a slave ship and was sold with his mother at an auction house in Charleston, South Carolina. Orphaned by age eight, his harsh, abusive and deprived American experience was just beginning.\n\nHow can our nation reconcile the depravation of that young eight-year-old slave with inspirational success stories of other Americans during that same century?\n\nFor an example, the American culture that granted opportunity to a middle-aged Texan, a Republican, whose \"federally protected\" freedom allowed him to pursue his dreams, to work, risk, overcome and to prosper. Respected as a pillar of his community, he was a successful entrepreneur who owned over 100 acres of farmland, which he paid off within two years. He also founded the first church and elementary school in his region of the state. He was referred to as fiercely independent and a very proud American.\n\nThis successful Texan farmer's gratefulness and unique connection to an eight-year-old South Carolina slave boy gave him an enduring love and respect for his country and his flag. The two, after all, were one and the same - my Great-Great Grandfather Silas Burgess, whose name I'm honored to carry.\n\nIs it possible to embrace a national history today that is such a dichotomy regarding the human experience? The liberal Left says that we shouldn't. They feel that all reference to that part of American history should be destroyed and our country should transfer wealth to atone for the deeds of white strangers who died 150 years ago.  They suggest that slavery is the root cause of the misery found within today's urban community.\n\nConservatives, on the other hand, point to the success of the Texas Republican as an example of the possibilities available to all Americans when individuals are granted a choice to adhere to the principles and values of success.\n\nThe middle-aged Texan proved the truth of this philosophy as he partook the fruit of his labor. His gratefulness and unique connection to an eight-year-old South Carolina slave boy gave him an enduring love and respect for his country and his flag. The two, after all, were one and the same - my Great-Great Grandfather Silas Burgess, whose name I'm honored to carry.\n\nMillions of other Americans from every other culture share this American experience. It is the gratitude of our present generation for our ancestors' grit and tenacity that forges a spiritual connection that gives us pride in our country's flag.\n\nIt is this connection that most black Americans do not have due to the sanitization of their history.\n\nSo why do I stand?\n\nI Stand- in gratitude to an eight-year-old boy, my great-great grandfather, who remained hopeful, tenacious and faithful as he grew to proudly serve his family, community and country.\n\nI Stand - in gratitude to a grandfather whom at the age of 15 years old, volunteered to serve in WWI. As a successful farmer, he raised 12 children who would all earn college degrees and taste of the mid-1900's American dream.\n\nI Stand - in gratitude to a father who succeeded in the day of institutional racism in the arenas of academia, as a researcher, an entrepreneur, a dedicated father and husband and a pillar of his community. He once recounted that his greatest life decision was volunteering and returning home as a proud WWII veteran.\n\nI Stand -in gratitude for the proud, successful, entrepreneurial and segregated Tallahassee, Florida, community where I grew up. The people of that community were determined that they would never be looked down upon or pitied as a race of victims.\n\nI Stand- as an example for the millions of black youth who have not been taught to love God, country, family and themselves by the liberal Leftist overseers who have controlled the urban community for the last 60 years.\n\nI Stand- against the sanitizing of our history.  The Left has already done so within the black community, resulting in the lack of gratitude seen on today's NFL sidelines.\n\nI Stand - as a voice to the NFL corporation leadership... it's time to Stand Up, Man-Up and defend our country and culture .

Robert E. Lee has backfired\n\nESPN recently targeted an Asian American for re-assignment due to the possibility that his name, Robert Lee, might offend black Americans.\n\nYou know what should offend black Americans? That ESPN thinks this might offend them.\n\nYou know what should offend Americans, period? ESPN and other liberal elitists like them trying to re-write history.\n\nYou know who was all about re-writing history? Karl Marx. The Father of Socialism. The Father of Marxism. He said the first battleground is the re-writing of history.\n\nYou know what else should be offensive? These same liberal elitists - black and white alike - who see themselves as Saviors whose god-like thoughts, actions and words can atone for the sins of other white strangers who died hundreds of years ago.\n\nIt is with this historical perspective that I would suggest that Democrats cease their obsession with apologizing for the deeds of those who died over 150 years ago. Instead I recommend that they focus on the impact of their own deeds today.\n\nThat is insulting - to me, as a black man, and to the past generations of millions of other successful black Americans.\n\nIt is thanks to the many decades of such re-writing of black history that most Americans are \"shocked\" to hear of the phenomenal progress made within the black community only decades after the end of slavery.\n\nThey are not aware, for instance, that it was visionary and entrepreneurial members of the black community who established our nation's First Business Network, whose featured speaker at its very first national convention was none other than President Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nThey are not aware that America's first female self-made millionaire was a black entrepreneur, Madam C.J. Walker, who was also renowned for her philanthropy and political activism.\n\nNo, the rewriting of history - and the desperate determination on the part of those who do the re-writing to turn all black Americans into victims - turns what should be aspirational and inspirational success stories, for black and white youth alike (but most particularly for black youth), into anomalies.\n\nThat is offensive.\n\nIt was the American black community of the 1940s, 50s and 60s that led our nation in the post -World War II explosion of the middle class - which more than 40 percent of black Americans belonged to. It was an era when black men led all other races in the percentage of those committed to marriage, and in their participation as entrepreneurs and seekers of higher education.\n\nIt is with this historical perspective that I would suggest that Democrats cease their obsession with apologizing for the deeds of those who died over 150 years ago. Instead I recommend that they focus on the impact of their own deeds today.\n\nIt is due to their own policies that the community that has trusted them most - a community that was once productive, independent and competitive - is now at the very top of our nation's misery index.\n\nHere's what I would like to hear an apology for. I'd like the Democratic Party to apologize:\n\n?         For the 1,800 babies that will die today under the hands of an abortionist;\n\n?         For the 83 percent of black teens who are unemployed due to Democratic policies like the Davis Bacon Act and minimum wage laws;\n\n?         To the urban community for the lost lives and lost property due to the angry and violent \"activists\" bred every election cycle by them;\n\n?         For the use of policies that breed black misery as a strategy for re-election.\n\nAs Americans begin to understand the destructive nature of the Socialist- and Marxist-inspired liberalism that has been wrought upon the black community, my hope is that they will also begin to acknowledge the dangers of this godless, empathy-free and anti-American ideology - and come together to pull all of our communities and our nation back from its dark abyss.\n\nThat is a history that I would be happy to write.\n\nGet the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
